"This game is pretty good, however I have some minor details that alter the gameplay a lil' bit. 1. Some of the songs don't even load like On Our Minds, etc. I can't even complete the campaign mode 2. Everytime I complete a level, an ad pops up. When I exit the results of the level, an ad pops up. It starts to get annoying. Overall, the game is pretty good!",
"All in all, I'm really enjoying this game. It's smooth, the graphics are fantastic, the controls are great, and the audio quality is really nice. My only qualm is that there are only 17 songs. An update I suggest would be to add more levels, and maybe as you complete levels in the beginning, more songs unlock. It would almost be too easy to complete the entire game on expert mode and lose interest. So far, it's fantastic, I just think more options would be beneficial.",
"This game is the closest I've gotten to playing beatsaber on a phone. Three things I would suggest: 1, make the game available offline. 2, lower the volume of ads, I get having to play an ad to double your coins at the end, but not when you exit a song. And 3, add more songs. I have not done them all, but I'm sure when I finish the game I will get bored of playing the same song over and over again.",
"At first I thought that this deserved a higher rating, and to be honest this would be perfect if only you got rid of all of the glitches, and tone down the ads a bit. I totally understand that you need to make money off this, but just tone down the ads. Not just only that I was playing a song and I was clearly swiping where the blocks were. It didn't go through so I ended up failing the level. Fix those few things and you would get a perfect five star",
"I got this because i dont have a proper vr headset to play the original. I thought this game was gonna be a cheap knockoff ad-infested piece of low-quality garbage, but it wasnt! The graphics were good, it isnt too hard but also not too easy, but it still WAS somewhat ad-infested. It would be great if you could lower the ad amount. Other than that, great game! I highly recommend.",
"The gameplay is cool, the graphics needs some work and the controls are so confusing, you can't use the red swipe on the right side and vice versa, so some of the cubes from the other side can't be swiped. Just to add up, it has really limited amount of songs, and could be better if the player could actually add up songs from their phone and so on. Overall, i really enjoyed playing it. It just needs a lot of improvement☺",
"Ok, so this is a solid game. Very fun, although a couple minor issues. 1: quite a lot of ads 2: I need more songs!! All in all, I really enjoy this game, and I also have a few suggestions 1: Create your own level 2: Some sort of customisability using the coin system (not lightsabers though) 3: Once again, MORE SONGS!! This game definitely needs more songs and less ads. The ads are very annoying, and I know you make money for the more ads, but this game could go to 5 stars with them. Thanks!",
Im impressed but you have a lot of work to be done. For starters make the graphics a bit better let it be FHD or something. Then it would be better if the blocks that are coming are smoother. You should also fix the sync so its perfect. And you should make the background less distractive. The game is really great I'm not hating on it just trying to help you get it in better shape. Honest opinions. ;),
"The game play is good and the levels become difficult as you unlock more songs but once you do that the game keeps crashing midgame and by that I mean the screen just goes dark. That is pretty annoying especially when you are having a good streak! I downloaded it some two days ago after watching a video online and it has already crashed twice yesterday and about four times today. if you skip or miss a few blocks, the blocks will start stacking up. Plus way too many unskippable ads.",
"It's a fantastic game and all but there are some minor bugs that need to ironed out e.g. The cubes don't sync with the music in some songs, if you have no data or wifi connected the game will still take you coins, and many other things. But the main thing that ruins the whole experience for me is when I am at home using wifi the game crashes, it is not a one time thing I spent well over ten minutes trying to get the game to run but it won't work. Until this is fixed I won't give it 5 stars.",
"This game forces you to watch ads... otherwise you can not play the game. For some reason this developer thought it would be good to add an anti-adblocker and force you to watch ads. As far as I can see it, this is just a massive cash grab from ad revenue. Not to mention how poorly this developer replies to feedback. Are you using Google Translate?",
"Very well done game, its not an exact replica of beat saber, but is is very simular and is a brilliant app to use if you can't get a vr to play it. Overall I think all the 1* are bots in my opinion, but if you think different that's up to you",
"Just remove the energy counter, it ain't fun, or sleek, I swear everyone will play your game, it's good but stop this force adds part. If they feel like playing offline there ain't nothing wrong with it, the extra few cents isn't worth loosing a masterpiece like this.",
Way to many Ads. Seems a good game but a 30 second ad before and after every song/level gets frustrating.,
"Hey goomzilla. I REALLY love this game. Its one of my favorite games that i play on my phone, its absolutely excellent. But i have rated 3/5 because there are soooo many ads. I end up having to restart the game after playing each level and there are still more ads. PLEASE get rid of the ads (yes i know you can pay monthly to get rid of them, but there shouldnt be this many here in the first place) so even just a decrease in the amount of ads would be fantasic. If this happens, i will rate 5/5",
It's amazing to have a non vr beat saber that is acually fun and all the songs are amazing to play and you have at least over 4-7 days of fun ahead! Although there is a lot of lag and glitching in the game and it makes it almost impossible to beat Godzilla expert+ with only 3 hits. The advertisements in the game are 30s-3m long and sometimes when you click on the +100 coins or 2x coins from a level there is a chance you wont even get it. The game is super fun it's just a few things.,
"First, I just need to say, if you really want to play beat saber but don't have vr, download this. It isn't an exact copy as there is a lot less songs in this, but there are 3 different modes: you won't miss any, you might miss a few, you will miss loads. Overall, constantly swiping burns my fingers so take breaks after every song or 2.",
"Good game but still, it can improve. The control, or the touch sensitive response is less. Also it makes mistake to identify which touch was for which hand. For eg. It sometimes alternate the left saber (red swipes) to right hand (blue swipe, touch). Also there could be more songs and if the background would be black and no other lighting, then it would be better.",
"Love playing beat saber in vr. Glad there's a version of it for phones, just annoyed at how I need to watch a 45 second ad, then play a game other than the one I downloaded for another fifteen seconds, then another fifteen seconds after I get to go back to the library. With a chance to show an ad again when you go into a song. Is beat saber credited anywhere for this? You've stolen their exact style in the maps for songs and feel of the game is if anything... Worse.",
"While this game isn't bad QUALITY, the mapping is pretty unintuitive, and as an expert+ beatsaber player, I find this game a bit triggering, but besides that, it look good, and I can tell a it of effort went into this. To be honest, in the beginning beatsaber levels were unintuitive too, so if the makers of this game learn to make good levels, I recon it could be good.",
"Keeps crashing just before I get the 1st star while playing. It stays frozen until I touch the screen again, then it sends me to my home screen. Which means, I haven't even finished a song yet. Please fix, I absolutely love the idea of this game and really want to play and enjoy it.",
"Expected a low-effort beatsaber clone, found a well made game that's fun to play when I don't have the quest on hand. It's not the same experience as beatsaber, it isn't as visceral, even the low rumble response in the quest controls gave a sense of contact. But this is still an exercise in skill, and completing a level gives that same dopamine hit. Worth giving it a try.",
"I want to give 5 but it needs more improvement. So the graphics, the design, the son choice, sound quality and smoothness of the game itself are absolutely stunning you couldn't of done more of a better job on that side so well done for that. However this games only issue and improvement that is badly needed is the timing sadly the cubes don't quite match the songs. All it needs is a timing improvement and I would gladly rate it 5 stars :)",
"To be honest, its the best game on Play Store so far that is the closest to Beat Saber's experience. I'd like a few changes though that are very easy to add: an FOV slider for those who get motion sickness because of the low FOV and maybe an extreme low graphics option too? I currently have to use GLTools to render the game at a lower render resolution and limit the textures to 256x256. And Expert+ to me is more like Normal. Overall though, its a really great alternative to Beat Saber!",
"Good game. Locked up my s10. Nice visuals, small music selection. Could be a great game. Edit: To the developers. i liked the game, but there are more flaws than there are good parts to the game. Locking up a powerful phone like the samsung galaxy S10, to the point i had to use emergency button combinations to bring it to Emergency restore, just so i could restart it, is not a very good feature, in fact, it pretty much destroys everything positive about this game. its a good game, but because of the fact that it locks up such a powerful phone to the point of emergency recovery? i have to rate it at it's lowest.",
"I would like to give a few ideas (Some are special for graphics) you see, that on the beatsaber vr everytime the sabers touch the ground they leave like a mark on the ground and then dissapear for a few seconds right? That would be cool for the game, also you can make the game with more fov or more view perspective and, you can choose the speed that you want the cubes to run into you so you can destroy them, that would be cool! The graphics are nice, they would be nicer if they had more glow!.",
"Don't get me wrong - the idea of this game is great and I'm glad that the design isn't deviated from the original much (I love it), but the ""delivery"" is flawed: it's laggy and has too many ads. And I don't mean that it's JUST the ads - ""you can turn off the internet on the phone and the ads are gone, - BAM! You are free to play!!!"" - nah, the game is actually dependent on ads, as you need to watch 'em to gain energy to play. Also the thing with additional perk ""disappearing tiles"" - unplayable.",
"This app is actually pretty good. The bad rating are probably just people who think games should be perfect. I do have a couple concerns, and I hope you read this, because they might the reason for those bad ratings. 1: It's painfully glitchy. Sometimes if you die, it keeps going on, and once it just kicked me out. 2: The ads. Now, I'm not talking about the AMOUNT of ads. I live with that every day. Ik m talking about how 90% of the ads that pop up CANNOT be skipped. Other than that, great game.",
"This game is SO fun!! I love all the songs and overall design of it, and its really fun to play on road trips as the songs are super fun to play over and over again. The time passes by so fast when you play the game and the different difficulties make it even better! I highly recommend this game for anyone that loves music and a challenge.",
"I can't see the colours of the cubes and it lags so much, I have a Samsung Galaxy J2 and it lags so much in my device (this is me after installing the game again) well I'm glad that this time I felt like I'm actually playing beat saber on mobile, but my problem is that whenever i turn on high graphics, it lags a bit but not so much. Thank you for making this amazing app! But it could have been more better if you add the option where we can add our own songs.",
"I wish I could add a .5 because 3 feels like underselling this. Over all the game is awesome, its a great mobile version of the obvious inspiration. That said, The campaign is buggy, lvl 4 and 5 seem unplayable. Tiles stack on screen, tiles don't recognize being cut, tiles disapear and the song continues to play. TLDR: Fixs campaign bugs, add music =5/5",
"I was playing the game in beta and it was good, I left it and waited for the actual game to come out and there are alot more glitches than before, the game will crash if you buy some songs and you can't reopen it at all, if you die by missing too much the game doesn't end and the cubes will stack up and your left saber will not cut anymore. The ads are also unskipable and happen every time you do anything in the game. It was better before the full release of the game. So I rate 2 unless it fix",
"I've played this game on IOS and it was pretty fun so I decided to play on my android phone but the game crashes everything I touch the screen while in the game. I'm not sure why it's going this but it can't be my phone. Also not to mention that there are way too many ads in this game, they're also really long and sometimes a second ad will pop up after the first one is done playing. I hope this can get fixed.",
"There are some glitches but the other thing I don't like about this game is the ads. Once you complete a song, it immediately goes to an ad. Then when you click to go back to the screen where all the songs are, it goes to another ad 🙄. I honestly think I will pass on this game because of the ads. Im trying to give the game another chance because it still is a good game, its just too many adds. If you hate games that spam you with a lot of ads, I highly recommend not to download this game.",
"Whats really anoying is that aftwrna little bit of playing, it will say""Critical energy"" and that you need to watch an ad. That would be fine but when i click on an ad, it never loads the ad. So then you cant play pr uninstall it then install it again.",
"It's really good, but every time I'm done with a song, all sound cuts out. Other than that, it's really good.",
"Been through the tutorial, so far so good however it would be cool if we could optimise graphics manually according to personal device configurations. Like it would be great to play with a better graphics of some hd tiles and 3D ligth effects. Edit: It's almost at the age just update the graphic settings and you'll find a five star rating instantly.",
"Really good mobike version of beat saber, however half the time a go to cut the blocks it dosent which makes it hard to get a full combo, also there is a giant + 30 on my screen whenever i get a perfect hit and it really annoys me because in the fast mode songs and songs with a ton of blocks, its hard to see what comes first and last. Please fix or tell me a way to fix the +30 green perfect thing",
"Mainly downloaded this for the ""you songs"" function, its not there. I could've lived with that, since you have decent songs(none are to my liking besides faster car because of sentimental reasons.). The blocks have no colour, 0 its just a white arrow flying towards the screen, which is extremely confusing to me. Over all ""okay"" game if you like no colour on the blocks and no 'your songs' function despite them advertising that.",
"Pretty good... when it works. It crashes... A LOT. I enjoy it, but the crashes combined with the ads get really annoying. The target things that you have to swipe are better on here than it is on iOS, but still... the crashes and ads kill the experience.",
It's a good beat saber ripoff but there is one thing wrong with it. Whenever you get perfect you have an epileptic seizure because of the green flashing numbers right in your face. It's very annoying and you should've just made the blocks the colours instead of putting the colours underneath.,
"It has good game play, but in terms of music and beats you got it all wrong. The point is that hitting the beats would make the beats of the music, and not put them in a random pattern with music in the background, please fix this",
"its a pretty good game, although the controls become a bit hard due to it being a mobile game, and games are usually not using two fingers at once, but in the desx it says unique game wich is a flat out lie. at least say it was inspired by the vr game beat saber. Thank you for responding, and I will give it give stars if you at least put in the desc that it was inspired by beat saber.",
"Well, I WAS having fun, until suddenly, the notes decide to go through my sabers. Ues, I'm hitting them correctly, and yes I'm using the right colours, but they are still doing it. Also, when I slice with one hand, the sabers decide to change colors. Please fix this. Also, can you add more songs?",
"It was great for a while during the first song, but half way througj, it wouldnt process the cuts and would always say I missed it. And during songs, this would randonly happen. Edit: Since the last update, I haven't been having problems with this. One problem I have had is that I have bought Alone - Marshmellow, yet it doesn't appear on my list as unlocked. So esentially, I wasted 500 ingame money on a song, that didn't even unlock. Otherwise, it's a great game!",
"It's and interesting concept, but I just found it generally annoying, especially when you trying for to play it and there's green flashing light obstructing your view of the targets and your left baffled on what to hit next, also not a lot of music, it's an alright game for mobile, and especially for a free game, but it wasn't very well thought out",
"Was ok. Beats were out of time with the music, ads were in the game even when it said it didn't have them but other than that it was ok. A little note to the developer: Instead of having 2 gibs for each cube to slice it, you can use the unity add-on called EzSlice. That will make it slice in the direction you sliced it.",
"Overall the game is better than any other game out there in this particular stream BUT! There are some blind spots that I found When you cut a note it it produces very unsatisfying sound effect wait!! I have seen beat saber and sound on that is clear and pleasing but in this it produces unclean kinda sound or something ,it doesn't synchronise and it's slow Q. Does this game support Bluetooth headphones. please consider checking.",
"To ""beat"" a level in this game on the difficulty ""expert +"", you have to be more than an expert +++ to even have a 3 fps chance. Really you have to be more like a godlike specimen just to do alright. And not because I can't keep up with the speed, but when i said 3 fps, im not joking.When i ""beat"" the first two difficulties on the first level i played and moved on to expert +, i looked at my screen,and said outloud. DAM BOI, DAS ALOT OF LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG!!!!!!!!!!!! .and lots of ads",
"Good game but I have some things to improve, first remove the numbers that pop up right in front of you because I can hardly see a thing, second make the blocks more visible, and last of all is there a way you can make it so we can do custom songs so we just upload a audio file and the game works out the beats or something. Thanks",
"It's a perfect game to play if you don't have a vr to play beat saber on. But there is one bug, 50% of the time when I touch the blocks it doesn't cut them, but the rest is great but I do wish you could download your own songs on here like other games. But other than that I love this game.",
"little laggy on my device, but still good! not too many ads, good graphics, and is a great alternative to playing the original. although, it is a little hard to tell if i have hit a note or not until i let go, which is pretty annoying. great job!",
"It's fun, just like the actual beat saber game but swipe. However it tells me that when I run low on energy, I get confused since there isn't a energy bar anywhere. It doesn't tell me how much energy I have! Please fix that, it is a great game! Also add more songs.",
"It controls very badly and even when I hit them it counted against me but it over all is a decent game with ok graphics and good songs but again it controls terribly and it doesn't really matter if you hit them correctly or not, you will still miss and it's kinda frustrating. EDIT: why are you begging me to give you more stars?",
"It is more accurate of a beat saber clone that other games, but it is not perfect. There is 1 glitch where the cubes gather up on the screen, and just sit there, and when the max amount of cubes gather up on the screen, nothing comes at you. Other than that, I have seen no glitches.",
"A great game covered in a blanket of ads, a wonderful recreation of beat-saber, and I'm proud. But the ads are overloaded in this game, making it hard to play. Like I said, gameplay wise I love it. The ads is their only bad downfall. The rest is just minor glitches that aren't that big of a deal",
"Without an option to remove the ""+3"" effects when u slice aa square perfectly it's hard to play. The effect is bright green (the colour our eyes are most attracted to) and pops up infornt of the boxes so its hard to see there needs to be an option to remove this ruins the whole game",
"At the start, it was ok but I heard smth wrong...It was the music. The music for the tutorial and unity (prob others too) are going slowly and making the song sound ugly... I gave one more as the controls are quite good. They did not mention that this was also inspired by beat sabeer which to me a youtuber feels like a copyright strike. If u could make the music correct and make the baseline but desugn same, I would be happy.",
"So i'm having this issue where the game keeps lagging mid song and everything is out of sync, no setting to bring down image resolution to make it stop lagging, no customizations such as saber or block color or even anything else. Also, i paid for no ads and ads keep popping up in my face either way. Good training for beat saber but lots to improve.",
"Very fun to play, real time killer. Although at times it can be too easy, I would be nice if you added a difficulty higher than expert, which had more blocks and slightly faster speed. If this is added I will rate 5 stars.",
"Good game. Although theres a bug when you die in a game. The game continues but the right side will be all misses. Then when the song ends, it stays frozen. Have to restart the round as soon as I notice.",
"The game was good at first but it became worse as I progress through the game, the controlls are very weird and hard, the campaign is VERY hard even in the start which was very annoying and sad cause I thought it will be a good game but I spoke too soon, please add a horizontal gameplay cause portrait is hard cause the top notes is hard to sclice.",
"Do NOT download this game. Takes up too much storage.wastes time in your life. I am going to end up putting a copyright strike on this game for copying the vr game beat saber. The blocks take forever to load. And I have no idea why two furry FREAKING fingers are in my way when I tap the notes. Sometimes my game crash. It should be sabers, not thumbs. The timing to hit the notes is horrible. It never tells you when to hit. The songs are WAAAY off sync. Dont waste your life. I can go on about more",
"This game is downright awful. You can never tell when to swipe because of everything that's going around on the screen. The double sideways swipes are almost impossible to get because of how tight the control pads are. The only song that people will recognize is Unity, and almost all the other ones are made by the same guy. Don't download. Waste of time.",
"The game works fine, but your screen position is horrible, there's not enough space for you to swipe on the side and always misses, the game would be fine if it was side ways like arceae, if you want a design, i can draw what the design can be and mabye it will look like beat saber but mobile version",
"This game has way to many adds, sometimes I can't even play. Whenever I mess up like a few or a lot, the blocks get stuck onto my screen and sometimes it can be really annoying too. The game is also good and whenever I'm not on VR I can just play this game... But it's not exactly the same haha. Please fix this game developer.",
"If you're gonna rip off a game, do it better. This game is a pile of flaming garbage. I can't tell if it's a feature or a bug, but having the blocks stick to the screen and render the rest untouchable is incredibly broken. Also, the legion of invasive ads is insufferable. You should be ashamed.",
"The game is cool and all despite this is a complete copy of the Beat Saber game on console, but nonetheless nothing really that intriguing or new... it's just that you swipe instead of doing a slash movement.. the only thing i could critize on this..is just that while you're in the game.. ya'll should've make the screen wider, so while you were playing.. there's enough room for both thumb.... a little more development would be great..",
"I'm not gonna go into the ads, because a lot of other people have already said it before. My main issue with this game is that at one point it just completely stops registering any thing. I dont know if it's a bug of the game or my phone running slow, but I'll assume that it's a bug because my phone hasn't acted like this before.",
"Definitely the best beat saber remake. I expected a low-quality ad infested piece of garbage, but instead I got a high quality, fun to play, and accurate remake. If you want to play beat saber but don't have the proper equipment, download this!",
"its actually really cool,i reccomend making an option to create your own level,also,you should make some even harder levels(like Reality Check Trough Skull) only reason i gave 4 is a bit too much ads. maybe offer us some OP stuff,but we have to watch more ads to get them? that way you can remove the forced ads.",
"Overall the game is better than any other game out there in this particular stream BUT! There are some blind spots that I found When you cut a note it it produces very unsatisfying sound effect wait!! I have seen beat saber and sound on that is clear and pleasing but in this it produces unclean kinda sound or something ,it doesn't synchronise and it's slow Q. Does this game support Bluetooth headphones. please consider checking.",
Buggy as hell. Can't play without a block flying into the screen and blocking half of the view which brings me to a second complaint. This should be able to be played horizontally. Smaller phones can't even swipe some of the more outside corners. Sometimes when you die the game doesn't stop and just plays the song till the end. And the ads are horrible. This game isn't close to being worth 5 dollars nor is it crown worthy of being subscription based.,
This game has insane graphics! The problem is that every time I go to the home page there is a 30 second ad and I understand that a game has ads but so many just isn't fair so please solve it and then I'll change my review,
"This game is so glitchy. The beat blocks would freeze, the background was SO annoying and would be the reason the game would crash every 5 minutes. And, whenever I would try to swipe the blocks, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME it would say that I missed it. I do NOT recommend this game. Please fix the bugs, and I might re-download this app. 😑😥",
"So experienced a glitch but i just started playing. The glitch was: When i hit the first arrow, The rest of the arrows dissapear. And then i have to guess where to swipe. The second thing: When you click for the app The little banners pop up on the screen, Where it shows you what its about. When you look at it, it look alot like beat saber, but i dont see no sabers. Shorter answer: Kinda Clickbait.",
"Would be better if it was a bit faster pace. Even the highest difficulty is way too easy. And the lack of songs makes it boring after 10 minutes. I know there's copyright issues, but until they acquire more rights to songs, it's not a complete game.",
"the app itself is very good, but it have me ads every time i unlocked my phone. The ads weren't inside of the app itself, but every single time i unlocked my phone, so i uninstalled it, and now the ads are gone. Maybe it wss just something with my phone, but you guys should check it out.",
"Amount of ads is absurd, failed a level, got prompted to watch an ad for a revive, which i didn't do, but it didn't matter because I got hit with an ad after the timer anyway, then there was no retry button, so I went back to the menu, or so I thought, because I just got hit by another ad immediately after just watching one, and they were those long 30s plus ads lol, uninstalling.",
It was nothing like the VR set. Probably the point but it was terrible. If you swiped too soon you got it but if you swiped when it got to the line you missed. That was not how it normally is. The graphics were bad too. Personally not a fan.,
"Good game, it gives that good panicy feel but when you get is perfect you still feel so good, as the VR vision did. Although only 4 stars beacuse if there is a lot of block and you miss a couple, all the blockes become unhittable and you lose...",
"Song selection is pretty half ass and obviously was just slap together. The notes are not choreographed at all, expert plus is like normal mode, there's a campaign that you can work for but you have to unlock normal songs for free play. 3 second ads that you have to sit through after almost every song.",
"To many ads, glitchy gameplay, off beat notes, many of the features don't work, requires dada, Wich means you can't use airplane mode. And finally, the cherry on top, a VERY limited amount of songs. Don't play this unless you want to throw your phone across the room.",
Dont get me wrong but this game is decent for a Beat Saber Clone. But I feel like I'm missing something and I'm not sure. It's definitely got some challenge with it. But it isnt just like the (Original) BeatSaber. I dont get those vibes at all. And it kinda sucks that I have to unlock songs and those songs aren't even the ones I've heard of. Even the ones I start out with. I love how you implemented lights. The graphics are good but I've seen better.,
"Unskippable ads, unreliable gameplay, songs don't follow the notes very well. Songs available also are normal pop songs you'd hear on the radio, not much rhythm based songs. Beat Saber was just never meant to be a mobile game.",
"I ABSOLUTELY love this game!!!! It is so fun, but maybe you should order the blocks to actually be closer to the beat of the song. Other than that, this is the BEST and ONLY beat saber game app I have seen that is this good. Also, maybe make an update where when you three star a song, it 1) asks if you want to do endless mode, and 2) unlocks the next song. Once again, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!",
"WAY too many ads, as soon as your done with a song ad, as soon as you want to get on a song ad oh do you want to leave a song early ad literally every option it gets to put an ad in my face it does and I wouldn't be mad if it had a timer for like 5 seconds to an x because at least then I could close off but there is no such thing every single ad is unskipable",
"Not playable. First tutorial song is fine but after that nothing works, cannot press any buttons and the app goes into ""beat swiper is not responding"" mode everytime. Tested on multiple devices and the same issue occurred.",
"Everytime i mess up the blocks stay on my screen, i wish it can stop but my kid andrea played and it did the same, please fix it there is too much bugs beat swiper needs to be fixed make a same copy of the game and make it the fixed version, when the blocks on the screen its harder to swipe. Please fix it i had to rate it 2 stars for being a bug issue please just now its too laggy also one more bug, i also hit the first block, but all the blocks were missing then i restarted but didnt work",
"This game is dumb. It is so laggy that i couldnt even get through the first 5 notes of the song. I also had to drag my finger all the way from one part of the screen to the other just to hit the notes. I would recommend that no one should waste their time on this game, because i was also really expecting it to be like the actual beat saber game, but i, as well as many other people, were fooled into wasting our time by downloading this game.",
For me is a GOOD game but the lights when you hit a box???? Wahteve is just too bright i fail just because i literaly cant see any thing so if you fix that or add an option to disable it i wont change my review. Also game is good and alot smoother in IOS. But its a good game i do recommend this for people who cant get the vr one its a very good game ._.,
"This is kinda a good game.. Songs, And.. the coler of the back ground. So.. you have to swipe the red and blue things. Yes? But you can just hold it and swipe so.. you can not let it go. But.. all good. No gliches, and no crashes. Good game!",
I love beat saber but it's not supposed to be a mobile game phones are too small and they lag too much also I try to swipe both blocks at the same time it misses one of them I mean I can barely get into the game without it freezing up on me so if you want to make this game more like beat saber change the size of the black hallway spitting out red and blue boxes and make sure it runs fine on Verizon bc i raged on the lag,
"The game is enjoyable but for me its too easy, expert + which is the hardest mode can be played with no problem for most people without a challenge but considering is says expert plus you should be expecting at least a challenge not just play through it once.",
"Its probaly just as good as the VR version, (since ive never played the VR version) altough i feel like the boxs dont match up with the actual beat, this might be one of three reasons, one being that this might be a mistake, two that this makes it easier for players with bad reflexes, or three being that it adds echo beat. If the developer does see this than write a reply to me.",
"Game is cool at all, but the ads makes the game unplayable.",
"This game is like a real beat saber,the detail,the block, and everything else,but there is 1 thing that make me angry,you cannot play the game if you don't watch ads,so you have to watch ads,and the ads is so long and annoying,don't to much ad please,but this game is still good,i enjoy it!!!",
"This game is good! It's a good Non-VR substitute for Beat Saber, its free, and you can take it anywhere. The only thing that bothered me was the Perfect swipe window feels too big. But thats all that feels wrong. Overall, 10/10.",
"Honestly I am very mixed with this variation of Beat Saber. First of all, upon arrival on the song selection for the first time, you will find that there is no way to import your custom songs which was shown on screenshots, Idk if you have to unlock it, but if you do, it's pretty dumb not having it at the start. Now gameplay wise, it's Beat Saber but it's not the definitive way to play it. I reccomend playing the actual Beat Saber or saving up.",
Nice game but we can not play the song we want to. There should be a of options of choosing our own song we have to choose song from the list. I want option for random songs. But five star rating.,
"I loved this game, I really find it addictive, and it really gives you a good experience, I wish there was more songs, and I dont like the songs with words in them, just the upbeat ones. I really loved playing songs with expert + please add more!",
"I get that you need the ad revenue, but I would really appreciate if you could close the ads a bit earlier because I always have to watch the whole ad after doing anything. Besides from that good game!",
"It is a really fun game, but I think the the graphics could be better. And Everytime u swipe the background turns into a different color, but otherwise it's awesome",
"This is a promising Beat Saber clone. Graphics are a little dated and simplistic. You are supposed to (as the name suggests) swipe the blocks with your thumbs. It feels a little clunky though, and I have a decent sized phone. Or maybe my thumbs are just fat. Like I said, it IS a promising clone...except the major issue I keep having is it keeps crashing, often before the song even starts. If that were resolved, I would likely consider paying the $5 for it.",
"just a ripoff of Beat Saber™. you didnt even try. you just turned the vr game that everybody knows, and turns it into a knock-off game that crashes a few frames after you start the first level. one star for you.",
It used to be really good but now its not getting my hand swips so I lose every time can u please fix it soon I haven't played it for a year now since that happened I decided to play it again and its still not working also there are these 45 adds that u can't skip or anything so can u fix it to as soon as you fix those I will give a 5 star again and if u only fix 1 I will give a 3 star so please fix it and you will git a better review from me have a great day :),
"So this game can be fun, but if I swipe twice on the menu it keeps crashing. I can only tap on the song select menu. And there's a crash even if I tap a song.",
"The game wasn't responsive at all, it lags, freezes or flat out doesn't want to take inputs and after 5 minutes with this game the experience was horrible. I looked around and couldn't find any way to reduce lag 0/10 Would not play again",
"Another Ad Simulator 2019. the game bugged out within the first 10 seconds of the tutorial. Restarted to play, ads everywhere. Finished a song and dont want to watch an ad? You'll get an ad anyways, no matter what option you picked. Unistalled after 5 minutes.",
"THIS IS GREAT! This is a lot like Beat Sabers, the VR game. The only thing that I would add, would be more songs and maps. Also a head to head gamemode. This would be when you go live woth another player with the same song, and you see you does less mistakes. Overall, the game is superb!!",
The game just doesn't work all I see when I start the game is a robot dancing or just an empty screen...,
"Some of the songs won't work the arrow blocks, don't show up",
This is a lot of fun because it has my 1 of the best songs in my history.👍😎😁♥️,
"Some reason when I want to start a level, the blocks don't even spawn",
I give this 4 stars because i really really love this game but there is some issue which i am facing that when i start to expert+ mode so when i cut the blocks in between it hangs and coz of that when i swipe the swipe does not accept. Plz fix this and else everything is great.,
It doesn't work I get through the start of the tutorial and then when it says let's do a song the app just crashes and I have restarted it and also deleted and reinstalled it and it keeps doing the same thing.,
"Just like beat saber and also so fun. Just one thing is your fingers get so close so if you can add a landscape mode that would be amazing, so keep up the great work.",
"Total blow... I was hoping that it would be something good until I saved up for a real RV head set, but all they have are dinky levels. Nothing is remotely hard, and what is CLOSE to hard is still dinky! All I say is stay the game should get harder the more you play.",
"The app is great but needed a few more settings to be added for example search and difficulty, The level loaded is too easy, need to make a choice of difficulty and add more songs without we having to download the mp3 first",
"Pretty bad, basically a Beat Saber clone. Only good if you can't afford a VR headset. I only really downloaded this because it looked janky as heck, and wanted a quick laugh, I was right, didn't laugh though. And, to add insult to injury, you have to watch an ad for new songs, each of which are about 30 minutes.",
Bad app. Too many ads. This app is not a game but an ad player. And I just don't get why the blocks are sticking on the screen when I keep missing. Song choices are too few and the ads....too many! Uninstalling!!,
"Very good game, just needs work on the animation of the cubes when they appear. Because sometimes they bounce too late and I end up missing the note. Maybe they don't need to bounce?",
First off the music is glitchy and second off when I played the song on easy mode it literally went too fast and I couldn't see if you supposed to go up and down you guys need to fix your game and if not you should just shut it down completely cuz it's not like the real thing,
"Could be a good game, but it is so slow, and so glitchy blocks will appear, then disappear, than appear behind you so you lose, they will appear, than freeze in place and then zoom at you to fast for you to do anything, blocks you swiped at will refuse to die, blocks you swipe at will come back after they pass you. Glitchiest game I've played",
I mainly put 3 stars because of the graphics this game crashes way to much if you could actully play this game it would be great littrly again littrly the only reason it's 3 stars is because of graphics I didn't have this app for longer then a day only like 10 games and all where crash was enough for me when I can play this without it glitching out then it's defiantly a 5 star game it most defiantly has potential,
It is incredible. But the reason I give 4 star is you can add some more songs and if you can then add different types of language of song. Instead of this it is amazing I have never played this type of game well done😁,
Excellent app for time passing with music.I watched beat saber videos on YouTube and searched if something like that is on mobile platform and its the exact thing.Only one thing that disappoints me is lack of music otherwise it's an awesome one.I hope you will add more popular music soon.,
"It's ok, many songs, but is very laggy and needs a sensitivity option, also every time I played a song I would lose because I was missing alot, I was swiping on the beats but I would still mess up, so I think there would be an easy and a super easy mode.",
"Trust me, you will NOT want this app. I randomly went into a song on first startup, and missed ONE note bc it was NOT clear when I was supposed to swipe, and after missing that note.. NOTHING HAPPENED. IT WAS JUST ME STARING AT A SPACE GIF! Do NOT download this app.",
"Some songs dont follow the beat. Also waaay too many ads, when u finish playing there's like a 40 second wait for ads, when I chose whether to retry or go to the main page, another ad! Uninstalled.",
"All I could do was look at the leader board, it wouldn't let me play any songs or anything. I uninstalled it then re-installed it, seeing if the issue was fixed, but this time when I clicked on the game it was just a black screen. However, before the issue occurred, I could play the game and it was great.",
"The best game ever!! Its like beat saber the vr game!!Its was so smooth!!I like it!! But can u please add more amazing song please? EDIT:Dear developer...i got some problem to share...When you play any song in this game and got a lot miss,it will stuck..You cant cut a block After that happend...pls fix...thank you and pls add multiplayer versus mode...thank you so much for the time..",
"The screen hardly responds, constant ads, the songs are barely even synced with the blocks and on the subject of songs there is very very minimal song selection. All in all a poorly done game.",
"It's good, I like it. But the songs are very limited. I would enjoy more songs like Beat Sabers hardest song ""Reality Check through the Skull."" But it does have VERY similar touches making it like a mobile port. And THATS cool.",
"I really don't want to be the one to be negative about it, but the game keeps crashing. I have an a52s 5G and every game that I have played works really good on my device, except for this one. Your excuse with ""there are many android devices and it's hard to optimize the game for all of them properly"" doesn't really work here because this is not a budget phone that I'm playing on and your first prority should be to optimize the user experience. For now, this game gets a 1 star from me.",
"The game's concept is great, but on some devices withe a smaller screen you can't see the arrows for what direction you swipe. This bug basically makes the game unplayable.",
Not a variety of songs like rock or rap and the game doesn't have good tracking when you swipe. Other than that the game is just a rip-off of beat saber and needs more music.,
Amazing all the music is easy to hear all the graphics are amazing! It is just straight up amazing in every way! There is tons of songs to pick from I never have and never will get bored of this amazing game!,
Why I don't think this is playable: First the cubes just Freezes and Second the cubes sometimes don't appear and your score gets affected too. I really hope the developers fix this. Other than that it's not that bad,
When i was playing believer the red and the blue were moving too fast so i lost,
"Amazing game with a very reasonable ad policy, granted it can be a little glitchy, (freezing when loading a song) from time to time but the amazing mechanics and gameplay more than make up for it",
"This is a great game don't get me wrong, I personally like it but ever since this August update whenever I play a song and and finish the song my game just crashes like 100% of the time and the worst part is, is when I go back onto it and I go on the song I just did and it says that I didn't do that song at all and so I earned nothing through doing that one song. (This goes with every song I do fyi.)",
Great! until this happened I love this game everything about it is fun. But I've been recently always crashing after I finish a song and not getting any sort of credit that I finished the level. Please fix this,
"I like it! Its so relaxing, but, the only thing that i dont like is, sometime's when i touch or swipe the beat/block it doesnt count as a score, or you can called it you missed a block. But, I love it tho! 😉",
"Fun game, but too many ads! I usually don't mind ad-supported games (hey, we all have to make a living and have bills to pay), but the ads are very frequent in this app. I uninstalled it.",
The worst game ever the lag is the worst part of it and sometimes when you swipe on them you have to swipe it at least 3 times again worst game ever i play online games on this phone and hardly any lag is there and this is not even near an online game and for the 3rd time THE WORST MOBILE GAME EVER!!!!!!! and if the lag gets fixed then i will play but untill then i won't bother with this stupid app i won't even classify this as a game it's so bad. SO FIX THIS APP!,
It's a fun game (on the few times it works) but it's filled to the brim with ads and they shove them in your face to the point it won't even let you play the game unless you see an advert by saying your low on energy (which you can't check or doesn't come up apart from then),
It's really good and hard I tried the easiest difficulty and still did bad but it really brings a big entertainment but the only down side for me was that it did not have the songs I liked so it was a little disappointing 😕,
Good game but there are things to fix like the ability to configure where the beats are on your screen and also don't put an ad after every time you exit a song and I guess that is it,
"I'd give it a better rating if it wasn't for the fact everytime I try to play it. It crashes, other then that I like it, it was fun and pretty for a phone game, if this could get fixed to where my phone won't crash I'd play it more and give a better rating",
"I only started just now, and I'm amazed.I was thinking it would be kinda bad but its good.Can you make weapons whenever you swipe?That would be awesome!Overall I think i will play this gane daily, and i think you should make it so you can search songs whenever you nake more!Its pretty good for a music game, this is my first music game I played so I'm so excited for future updates!Thanks for reading this.",
"Well then, could you listen to requests for songs? Thanks! Also, I have swiping issues. If I double swipe sideways, the red one will say it is not the right direction sometimes.",
"This is not fun to play. If the blocks were 3d I would be able to play it better. Also when I get a block right it pops up large numbers on the screen. This is very distracting. And to the developer, do NOT tell me to rate more stars in the reply. My opinion is my opinion.",
Imo This is a great game.. I understand that ads are annoying I'm a f2p player so.. yeah the solution is turn off your wifi or mobile data and when energy is low exit the app and then turn wifi or mobile data back on and watch an add and rinse and repeat. My suggestion to the developers is lessen the adds and add IPA ex: themes and Effects. As a game developer you should know how players love customizing their games don't forget to add the anime.. Great game.,
"My experience was great, but my only issue is it is not perfectly timed slashing, its not going with the music right. Please fix this!",
"Goingzilla admitted to pretty much copying the game beat saber, but yes it is entertaining, it can get really addicting, and I am sorry for writing such a review with low stars and just saying ""you just copied beat saber"", but on the other hand there are a bunch of glitches such as the swipes not registering, or the game closing automatically when you open it.",
"It's a really entertaining game, but the reason I'm giving four stars is because the free version of the game needs a lot more songs like wellerman, levitating etc, but great game doesn't require too much skill.",
The games broken. 1st when I run ou of lives it doesn't end my game. 2nd the reason why I'm failing is cuz it stops work in EVERYTIME like when I swipe it says I missed and I didn't hit hit. If you fix this and if I haven't forgotten about it then I might play it again,
"It would be good if it werent lagging every milisecond maybe lower the graphics and make a settings to ""delete content(reset)"" ""Add song"" ""Lower/increase details"" ""Joystick"" If you notify me and add them and more ill bumb the rating to 4 unless you did another bad job its staying at 1",
"I really like the style of the game, it has easily lovable color assortments and I do get very satisfied with the colors and flashing lights, it's easy and not a hard game! That's why I love it that much.",
It's good but the songs are off beat. Especially when you import one of your own songs the hits are just in random places and it doesnt sound very nice-,
"Total Beat Saber rippoff, and not a very good one. Controls are unusable if you have big hands. They've not only copied the game play, but the entire play environment.",
"It was a nice game though, but i've unlock all of your sounds and use it, and i kinda feeling boring cause i already played all the sounds, i just want a new songs and that would be great! Hehe i just want some other music to play, thats all thank you.",
"there are glitches and lots of ads. if I may also suggest, to pls make it in landscape mode because it seems much easier. overall, it's a gr8 game if it weren't for the glitches and ads :)",
"This is a blatant rip off of Beat Saber. the controls are rough around the edges, notes don't match up to the beat. The songs are not that great for a game like this. My main issue is it is try to copy Beat Saber, but failed. It is just not fun to play.",
"Good gameplay and all but whenever i use my coins to buy a new song, i start the song, the game crashes, i lose my coins and cant play that song again, im stuck with the only few free songs.",
"I love the game overall, but lemmi tell you... when it gives you something for an add... take it, it will give you an add anyway so thats why im giving it a 3 star, i know you can pay to remove adds but im not spending 2 dollars on thos mobile game. Thank you!",
"So in the description ot says ""An unique mobile rythm game"", The game is just a money making version of beat saber, The developers just want to have 5 stars so that they get more poeple to watch ads and to pay for the unlimited lives and no ads which ruins the game because you still get 100% score which ruins the leaderboards. The developers keep on blaming phones for the reason that the game doesnt work, but it's not the phone, it's the game. Very laggy, and cant play at times. Dont download =/",
Very fun but there is one glitch where if you miss too many blocks they just come up to your screen and stay there and if you keep missing the blocks you cant hit anymore blocks and then soon the blocks just stop coming ill give 5 stars once this is fixed.,
When I put it on the hardest difficulty it would not register any of my swipes but it worked fine on the other difficulties. Other then that great game.,
It'd be better without the green +30 popping up everytime I get a perfect and filling the screen. It makes the game nearly unbearable.,
The charting is hot doodoo and way to many ads. I die I get a ad. I beat and I get a ad and then after that when want to go back to the songs I get another ad it's just hot garbage. And it feels very uncomfortable to play,
I like the game but the only reason I rate it 2 is bc everytime I'm so close in the end it crashes pls fix it so I can give you 5!,
Fun to play when you can't play VR Beat Saber but the adds are so long! Like longer then the songs! And it's really glitchy. One time my device looked like it got hacked it glitched out so much!,
"I really like this it's music is also good, but the problem is, when i played each music and after seconds the game will press home on its own so it's 3/5 so please fix it.",
I love this game so much The one thing you need to add is AR basically when you move your phone around the camera move so then playing beat swiper will be a lot more fun but anyways I love this game also can you make all the colors lighter please I don't like how they're darker,
It's really fun- tho the ads can be annoying. I like how it's the original songs and not a cover. More songs should be added though.,
I would recommend this to everyone however the reason I have this 4 stars is because first of all I have not finished all the songs yet but it would be great if you added more songs such as bts or something and second of all the adds are too loud whenever I finish a level so please add more songs and lower the volume of the adds,
This is a really good game. Very fun and entertaining but now the problem begins when it forces you to watch an ad for it to resume playing. Not alot have internet connection all the time. Please update it.,
"I see what the app is going for but it doesn't execute well. When I swipe, it barely picks my motions up and completely messes my attempt up. If you want a good beat game, Beat Fire is the one.",
"I cant even begin to explain how bad this game is, you can barely see and everytime i hit something i get flashed by green lights which just makes it worse, if i were to give this game 5 stars it would need to have some major improvements.",
It's good except for whenever I go to an ad and click X to go back to the game it just goes black so I have to restart the whole game but I keep my songs progress.,
"Everytime I miss a lot of notes it's supposed to say ""LEVEL FAILED"" but it just makes the notes stick to the camera and there's no notes don't download this game it's a rip-off. Please update it. It's a little bad not the much.",
"Not very responsive. Once you ""die"" you can't retry right away, you need to watch an ad first. The people who made this could learn a lot from a similar app called, Dancing Blades. Uninstalling this now.",
"The game kept crashing constantly, over and over again. Just a few seconds and it would stop working no matter what. Just grab a VR headset and play beat saber",
First of all it's an amazing game if u don't have a vr but the songs aren't difficult and the only minor issues is the ads and that it's not difficult and that it doesn't have much songs and that's all but apart from that its a 10 out of 10,
Dude this game is so cool there are so many songs that you can play on this app. But sometimes when you play you might mess up. It's ok if you do. You can practice playing on easy until you really get good and play on expert!!,
"I love the game, sometimes I feel like I'm nothing and I'm just here I play the game and it's like. Having fun or idk, I just forget everything and have fun, it's the closest to (beat saber) you'll get, and it has some good song, although some in my opinions are fillers, I love the game, I also sometimes dislike the controls, I love the game and pls add more songs, if you're looking for a beat saber game for mobile this is for you, but if your looking for a 3d game just no 5 stars but controls.",
Its a good game and thank you for making it wider is so easy to get those cubes that was so hard to get (this is just a funny thing i found ) if you try tp download a song with very very bad wifi it says error with some weird symbol its not a fail in the game just bad wifi😂,
I get the game is a copied for a mobile phone but when I downloaded it and went true the tutorial you can't see the arrows on the cube I thought it was a wifi problem I checked I had 4 bars I did it again not in tutorial mode and it keep going you can see the arrows so its just really hard to play the game,
I actually like the game it's probably one of the best the only flaw is that it started to crash more so I can't play it and when it didn't crash It froze but besides that this game is could can you fix this if possible?,
Sadly a bad game thought it was good by how it looks when i swipe up and down it just kept on counting miss when I'm swiping it hard it's quite laggy for me sadly,
Fun but the cubes are to close and you can't change how close or far they are and there's not a lot of customizing.,
Yea this game is awesome and fun but everytime I finish a level and go to main menu I have to wait like 30 seconds because of a ad. Oh and the game lags to much. 😁😁😁,
"This game is good and all, but it has problems. When i play campain mode, it lags so i miss swipes and it makes me try the level all over again.",
The songs is fire not too many ads but there is still ads fun to play would recommend sometimes a little lag but that's too much as well and would recommend once again it is a pretty good game but better on a VR,
"When i open this game😄it make very wonderful sound!! WHICH IS JUST UNPLEASANT TO EARS!!!😠I reinstalled this app more than 10times but IT'S STILL SOUNDING LIKE HELL!!! it's sound is like this app having BUGS!! LOTS OF BUGS💢 it's not my mobile it's only ur app my other apps r fine😒but app just being headache to me lagging,it's not playing song instead making bug like sound WHICH IS JUST UNPLEASANT😠💢features are amazing but🙃wht I'll do to full of features app but I can't use🙂 totally waste.",
"Pretty good game, my problem is the amount of ads in the game, if you could, can you lower the ads down a bit please, other than the ads, game is great",
"Its a nice ""rip off"" of beat saber BUT i like it the only reason i gave it 3 stars was because the ads after you play a level take 30 seconds or longer and you have to sit through them. and i wish you could add your own songs 🙂",
I played a few maps or levels and then the game went psycho and the music slowed down and when I tried to play a level the notes were spawning behind me so I failed and I restarted the game and that didn't do anything so fix your game,
"Hm.. overall this game is pretty good unless you have epilepsy ofc dont download Still, pretty good. Overall sync is okay the if you hit a block too early the sync will get ruined and is hard to complete just bt sync and again PLEASE ADD A EPILEPSY WARNINGGGG",
"It's kinda bad, honestly. I installed it thinking it would be cool, but it wasn't. It's hard to play, and it's kinda nothing like Beat Saber. I do not recommend. It's a disappointment.",
"This game is good in September for the glitch, such as when you swipe they don't hit the box's when you do hit them, and when you have the ads that make you watch them until they get to a certain number, it's straight up annoying",
"Actually it's not bad, the songs aren't the best but it's a nice game but it's a little hard to swipe some of the blocks but it's fun I guess I would recommend it. (If you like beat saber)",
"It's fun to play, but there are way too many ads. I had to sit through 45 seconds of an ad before I could skip it. That is completely unreasonable. That is why I'm only giving two stars.",
Feels a lot like beat sabar(mobile) and is a nice game to have it in your cell phone. Overall the game is nice but would be nicer if you add more songs and custom music (if possible 🤗😉😉) or online music play. Nice game Keep it up 👍👍👍👍👍,
It was GREAT😍 it's a lot like the VR but it's not on VR but still little hard to control but still best version yet if your looking for a high speed action packed music filled fun game then I highly recommend it 🤗,
"Its a great game and all but the fact that there's not the custom song thing and there's adds everything you complete a song is kinda annoying, please at least add the custom song feature.",
Horrible! When I was playing I was hitting the blocks and it kept saying miss and then the song would keep playing but there were no blocks! And very laggy.,
"This is a good game, though it IS a copy of beat saber, there's a problem where you can just tap the cubes, but if you swipe it gets a little fun. Also no, I'm not eating 5 stars stop begging, Devs. Install if you like to tap cubes for some reason.",
"Stupid! I know it's the best they can do outside of VR...but honestly, don't waste your time on this. The tiles coming at you aren't even in sync with the songs, you always have to watch a long ad to unlock a song. It's just stupid. Don't get this game!",
"I love the way it looks and sounds but when I complete a song it always loads an ad when I go back so, It would be nice if the game could have less ads otherwise it's pretty good sorry my name for Google play store is my YouTube channel name",
"Great idea, poor execution. My two thumbs can't swipe the notes when they come at the same time cause they're to close together to be able to swipe both",
This game is so dumb the controls 👎is the game addictive 👎the controls arent even right when it does up-Right I do that it goes down when I do the circle-it said when your about to cut circles you can cut anywhere welli did that and it did ❌ dont install this game.,
"Its a good port of Beat Saber to a phone with no vr headset. 3 stars cuz when the Health bar is down the blocks stick to the camera, no death/lose screen and i cant hit blocks... Also its portrait so my hands cant fit on the screen.",
"It says miss whenever I hit a block, and many times you don't even have enough time to be able to hit them so no matter what, it counts as miss... wish I could rate zero stars",
It's good but the controls are terrible and you don't have space to swipe both of your fingers. It's hard to see the blocks and sometimes you can't reach them.,
"So with beat swiper I really like it, but could you add fnaf SONGS and a search bar and all the songs in the world? But anyone who downloads this app remember that there are only certain songs. See u soon :)",
"In the songs I tried, the blocks didn't really appear to the rhythm, there are too many ads and doesn't track the slashes very well...",
"Imagine if you took beat saber and gave it songs no one knows, horrible controls, only two variants of which way you can swipe, and the blocks dont sync up with the song.",
"Very boring, and you need to swipe twice to get it to register the touch everytime theres a cube. AND, Its very, very slow.",
"I think its a good game but i prefer the old one before the update, it had more songs and was more like beat saber, and also it ran smoother, the game every now and then glitches and messes up my streaks but for 4/5 it's actually a pretty decent game",
"I think this game is hopeless, whenever I press to the level, screen goes blank except the pause button and stuff so that means I couldn't see the cubes to swipe/cut.",
"This app doesn't respond when you swipe it, even if it does, the blades passes through the block completely, besides the first few blocks, the rest becomes unplayable.",
"I imported my own song. It's horrible. It wasn't in the beat, and I could hear the slashing too much. It annoyed me that it wasn't like Beat Saber. I have played Beat Saber and love it, but this isn't the same. Please fix it",
"This game is simply terrible, it's so laggy and the accuracy is AWFUL. The expert+ difficulty isnt even hard.. I do not reccomend this game to anyone- unless you've never played a real rhythm game and dont know what good quality looks like :/ 👎👎👎",
"I really loved this game but the blocks don't move with the music and I can't seem to hit any blocks, it also lags and doesn't let you play the song you want.",
"It doesn't even work. Whenever I swipe a block to cut it, it says I missed. It's also constantly lagging and doesn't stay in the rhythm",
"Its too easy, and the song selection kinda tells me that its a cash grab. No one who would want to actually play beat saber would probably not be interested in them, only people who would download after a cringey ad.if you want too play a free game based on beat saber play Sound Space on Roblox, it has good songs and actually difficult",
I had fun. I feel like i experienced beat saber. But could you find a way to add custom songs? the game will hit for sure :D I also got a problem. Sometimes suddenly o have a lag spikes. Can you fix this ASAP?,
Worst app ever when you pick a song it's fine but when you start playing the song starts and if you get one hit wrong it starts all over when you do it right it starts you over again :(,
Ok so I played the game again and it's improved alot so it's actually pretty good but not yet for a 5 star but it's slowly getting there so good job at improving the game. (Oh by the way I didn't now how to edit your own review so I had to delete the old but now I just figured it out again),
"I love it so much all the updates are so amazing I actually felt like I was playing Vr Beat Saber This game has improved alot and I recommend anyone who can't afford Beat Saber or just want to start off as a beginner to get used to the game Beat Saber to play this Beat swiper app. I love all of the song choices , but If you want I can request extra songs like: Shatter me-Lindsey Sterling Into you- Ariana Grande Don't start now- Dua Lipa My oh my- Camila Cabello Mia- Bad bunny and more.",
Game crashes all the time. It crashes loading any song or downloading any song. You developers gotta get back into unity and fix this.,
I love this game. Now a days just listening to songs are boring but this makes it more and more interesting. The best part is it also has a VR(virtual reality) form also. The gaming and the music brings out my skill and touches my feeling,
"Love it, but its way to laggy at points, and all the flashing on the screen makes it hard to see the next arrows etc, besides that I love the game!",
"Well, firstly, if the game actually worked and didnt have huge green letters being shoved into ur face that might make it better. And also please add more songs, because there was probably 10 in total",
"if your gonna play this dev. you should have a sense it has the most baddest controls ever. even thou i have mastered it, and also the points that are popping in the game are very very stupidy annoying. pls, fix this ill edit my review if you managed to fix it",
I like the game but i played out all the songs so i deleted the app. So i think that you shuold add a feture were you can type in the song and it will let you play for free EDIT:i redowleded this app and liked it but u have one sugestion could you pls add some anime songs pls and thanks.,
"Clickbaiting import function, asks for storage perms such as, explore files or something like that, even though there is no use other than save data which only needs the access to put it in its own file.",
This app is TERRIBLE. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. It is very jerky and the blocks don't light up untill they are almost past you and even when you do hit them it counts it a miss. Bad game,
"This is an amazing game and great time killer. Note to the developer: Can you consider adding more levels and / or making a level editor? I feel the level editor might take a while, but would be totally worth it! Thx! :D",
Fun game! I love this game because it's so much like beat saber but more easier and 1st person. I give it a four star rating because there's to much blocks at once and a bit of lag. But the game is perfect 👌👍 Good Job with this game,
"I gave this game a four stars cause when you update it you'll see a ""Play My Song"" and you can only choose one song of yours and the ""Play My Song"" will never show up to your screen.... As in never .-.",
Moves with the beat but lags every now and then lags causing you to miss the cubes when you slide in the right direction. Plus ads.,
"This game is good, it would be better if the somgs were actually in sync with the strike.. At first I thought it was only for a few songs, but then I realised that none of them are in sync.",
"It's horrible, I say this because you can play the frickin game. My god the game is so bad. I'm sorry but I don't mean it's just a lot of adds. It's HORRIBLE don't play it, it's one of the worst I have played. I'm sorry but creator, you need to work in this game and the laggyness, the way I can't even play, the point that I wasn't able to swipe. Just don't people.",
I wouldn't recommend this game is glitchy it's broken and just not good guality and it's not worth it honestly I deleted it in the first 5 minutes it doesn't work right there's no option for settings the cube's didn't even show up on my screen the first time I played it needs work,
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ! Way to much lag on my tablet. Especially since it's a old one. This is just a offbrand version of the vr best saber. too many ads. And not many music options to choose from. 10/10 I do not recommend this. Unless your looking for something CLOSE to vr.,
"I like playing it but the STUPID ADS, can please remove the ads it like when you finished the song and then all of a sudden an ad came. I hate it",
"Its an amazing app. But theres a problem with the add. Im trying to play my song, and when i try to press the add botton i didi'nt work. better fix that.",
Horrible I can't hit blocks because of this glitch and when I die it doesn't end the level it just plays the music without any blocks. Don't waste your time,
The game is amazing itself but why 3 stars first of all the green text covers your screen each time you cut a block and mostly the cubes are not see able enough were not in the dark ya know? And if it changes 5 stars,
It's really neato but can be a less laggy and a bit hard to do a combo left and right on the same time it's really nice and can get a editor mode making our own ones would be nice,
It's a very good game but there is a bug where its says perfect every time and the hit on the box is not the same as the beat but everything else is fine,
I like the game overall but unfortunately if I miss 8t to much and try to hit it again it doesn't work at all So I give it a 4 because I like it but overall please help these bugs or glitches,
"This game is laggy, and when you hit the hitbox. A damn text will block your screen, and even when its not still on the line, it says miss, this game us GARBAGE, GARBAGE, GARBAGE.",
The game is awesome but the blocks get stuck on the screen when that happens when you cut the notes it does not count so please fix it.,
hey there so i like this game its really good just a few things i need to say. first it doesnt have the option to pick your own song and second i think that the slash noise when you slash a box should be a little louder. thanks for viewing this review,
I cannot see the arrows pointing down or up or left to right so I'm just going to write this at three but yeah can you change that please for the sum of us I know that some of us have that glitch but although the game is pretty good.,
The game is good but it would be much better if i could play it horizontally and bot when my phone is vertical. Please make it possible and the game would be 5 stars,
"Its a really good, its just that for some reason the colors wont show up on the cubes and the points would be all over the screen",
"It's good, but there's a glitch that makes my screen when I beat swipe it shows the pause button and timer. Please fix this.",
I love it ists like beatsaber but when i used blue on red with the correct direction it says its perefect it doesnt damage you thats why im doing all levels with one color right now XD what i mean is using blue slash on the red block doesnt damage you unless if you blue slash it on red block with incorrect direction O_O,
This game is the best game to play as beat saber on your phone. I'm giving it a four out of 10 because the arrow colours don't match but you can pretend the colours match anyway.,
Its fun and very graphicy but there is a bug that makes it to where if you miss to many the blocks still come but you just can't hit them,
"This game is perfect but last month I open the game, it can rotate to landscape mode. But today I opened the game, I cant rotate the game! It so hard to play with straight phone!!!",
Whenever i play i cant see the cubes because the score keeps popping up in the middle of the screen and i keep missing the cubes pls fix it if you can i really love this atleast make the score on the top not in the middle,
This is a copy of the ps4 or game beatsabers. I just want to let you know that there is a song with 2 things on each side and it is impossible to complete. Literally impossible.,
"Has everything needed for 5 stars.. the fact the no songs are in sync with the actions makes it impossible to play... Hi Team, my phone has a Kirin 980 and a Mali-G76 MP10 .. so I am pretty sure that is not the issue.",
For some odd reason when I go to robot wars it doesn't show me the beats but in normal saber song mode it shows me the beats perfectly fine if you could fix this then that would be nice thank you,
I cant even play the game everytime I click on the app and click the play button it puts me in my home screen please fix this as soon as possible I will leave a review when I can actually play the game. Thank you:),
"COOL!!! I really like this app but I wish there were more songs like: Bad Guy by Billie Eilish 7 Rings by Ariana Grande Senoríta by Camilla Cabello And ETC. Plz make more songs. But overall,it's a pretty good you should totally download it!!!",
Wish I could give zero stars. This game doesnt work whatsoever. The game quits everytime you press one button. Do not download it is a virus and a scam. Do not download it's horrible. Doesnt even work.,
Probably the best one out there....not gonna complain about the ads they are fair for the developer but I just wanna complain about the cube sound after I cut it it's too low and barley can hear it even in headphones otherwise it's really a great game I recommend it,
I hope u can add more lights at the back and hope u can follow the rythem of the beat so the lights can also follow it its not following it. Please fix it add more lights too like the beat saber has.,
Could be a 4 star but it was to meny adds whenever you do anything restart go to home or start a song and you lose to much life if you mis a block and miss a lot cuz your fingers cant slide that fast on a dry screen,
"I love how this game gives a me an accurate experience of the game beat saber since i cant play it. Im giving 4 stars because if you lose all your hp yiu just stay there and cant do anything, i would like a game over screen to make it clear.",
"The graphics are good and even the game and the beat, there sometimes the beat is not like in the swipe but the game good ni e job😁.",
"This game is absolute trash, this is the perfect game for you if you want to be blind, the score is in your face, so you can't see anything. The only good thing I can say about this game is that you get to listen to the songs before choosing them, although this game sucks, I don't recommend",
Usually have one ad after the game and sometimes lags in the middle of the game causeing you to insta fail if you have insta fail on but other than that it's an amazing game :),
"I enjoy this, some songs are better coordinated than others but over all its fun and challenging, although i agree with the other review it needs more music",
I played for a bit and died constantly due to mobile not being built for having multiple thing touching the screen at a time. Edit:forgot to mention bad fps,
Great HD ame vety fluid on my device p30 pro. If yoy love beat sabre get this game. Very fun. Could do with more songs or a way to add you own. Other then that defo recomend it. Ads yes there are those but as its f2p then that is a small compromise. 😁👍,
"This is a 4 star,I love the game the graphics are fantastic and The audio is nice its realley easy but it needs more songs to add And its need more settings.",
I can`t cut the cubes and they build up in front of the screen and it's terrible so I would give zero stars you dummies! The next game that is this bad is not existing because this is the worst game I ever layed my eyes on! Literally NOTHING can COMPARE to how bad this game is! I WILL NEVER EVER PLAY ONE OF YOUR GAMES AGAIN!!!,
"Uhh when I was playing it, the arrows weren't showing up, thus making the game impossible to complete. Cool idea though.",
Great game! It's just like the real game!! I hope there are more songs in the future because this game ROCKS! There are no ads (which is the BEST THING €V€R) DOWNLOAD NOW!!! ;3,
Every time I try to play a level my hole screen goes black and nothing happens. Could you please fix this I really want to play your game. Yay it works now and I love the game it's so fun!,
"I hoestly thought this would be just liek the original game... The graphics are ok, but there is a lot of lag, and my phone is a s10, but playing this only gave me about 2 FPS which is horrid.",
This game is amazing and fun. can you add a creator mode where people can make there own songs and add more songs please thanks. (Edit) : I love the new songs but could you put the song CRADLES BY SUBURBAN thanks. : ),
All I see is a black screen and music playing. Is it because i'm not on mobile or is it just my chrome acting up Bet it would be a good game if it weren't for that :( JUST KIDDING XD,
Laggy. Adverts after and at the start of every song. Game is unplayable. Dont recommend unless your using a good emulator or have a decent phone,
"Doesn't work properly the display is glitched. I tried this on 3 phones and in the first one the sound was glitched , the other 2 display..",
Really fun and time consuming game but it keeps crashing every time i win a game dont know whats the problem but its really annoying cos it means I can't get any money,
I enjoy this game and I like the idea of beat saber on a mobile platform controls are simple and the songs aren't that hard and really enjoy the gameplay,
I love the concept but whenever you hit a perfect key... it pops up a stupid green light and i couldn't see where the next block was.,
There is a bit of a problem with the tracking abd sometime blocked don't hit makes it hard to do Godzilla even though I beat expert plus it was very hard culd u add skillet songs please it's a band,
this game is really fun don't get me wrong but I really don't like the fact that it won't let me swipe the blue at the same time as the red and it's really not fair to me because I keep failing every time please fix this and then I'll ain't the stars go four or five,
"I love this game. It's like BEAT SABER in VR.I wanned this game to add in the Android.because I like this game, I rate it all the 5 stars.get an update quickly.give us having our own songs.like I want to have a different song then I couldn't get it. (And thanks for replying my rate)",
"The basics songs are nice, but the other songs are very very well designed. Live the game.",
I don't usually bother writing reviews but this app sucks it lags and it won't play the music it's super hard to get into and it's just over all terible sorry but don't waste your time😡😞,
This game is downright just the mobile version of beat saber but could you guys add more songs and where we could make our own songs besides that I cant recomend this game enough thank you for making this game you dont even need a oculus for this game all you need is a phone and enough GB to download the app,
It's very good you should download it. (Its pretty much a mobile version of beat saber!) So if you dont have a VR headset and you only have mobile and you wanna play beat saber this is the way to go!,
Its very very extremly fun there are a few lags in the system we have low connection but it is very fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INSTALL IT OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN...................,
"It was good but the same ad kept playing again and again and AGAIN, I know that apps are supposed to have ads but that was annoying.",
The game is awesome but there is an issue with it on the how to play the beat swiping things are ok at first but than as you get into the song the arrows disappear,
The game does not work at all I couldn't play any of the songs and why are they all expert even if I could play the song I wouldn't be able to cuz I don't have any experience why would you put them all expert whoever made this game is dumb,
The game is good but there is a texture issue were the arrows may nit rendernon the cubes another glich is the blocks are in ur viwe somtimes if you dont swipe them so then u cant continue.,
"i loved the game alot and i am now good at the game,but the thing is the game show us that we can play our own music,But how do you do it?Or is it deleted?I just want to play my music because its kinda boring with the song that are available",
Would like to use modifiers on any level in freeplay. Need more levels and game crashes often (running on galaxy s10),
It is a great game it doesn't look as good as the VR version but that's because it's in VR but I can't add my own music. Please explain. Thanks,
Its broken 😾 When you miss one it gets stuck on your screen and then it won't let you chop anymore cubes Also you can't go 5 mins without an ad ITS SO ANNOING. I KEEP GETTING ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROUND ITS SO ANNOING AND GUESS WHAT I AM DELETING THIS GAME UNTIL ITS FIXED 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😤👿😾,
"This game is just as awesome as beat saber. Just a mobile version, that's it. The only thing that annoys me is the amount of ads in this game.",
Good Things but there's a problem: -You won't die if you loose health -ads are coming if you restart and exit the game Good things: -Insane Blocks. I can't possibly do this -My fave music is here,
"Almost perfet! please make it lanscape!! :0 and the view could go higher and wider, so that i would know that some beat coming (i always surprised some beats covered by my own finger and missed). GIMME MORE SONG PLEASEEE",
It's ok. The music is good. But there imput lag the wrost lag fro games like this. If you want beat saber for your phone this ok one. But i do recommend other games. 4/10,
It is a really good game you should get it is just like beat saber but mobile and you can skip the ads usually:3 don't listen to the other people that say it is trash:3,
I would give this game 10 stars if I could. I love it! I wish there were some older songs on here. This grandma is not familiar with alot of the new music.,
Beat saver is just like the one in vr this is good 👍 make more games like this!!!!!!! And I don't know why people think it's not good like I was lucky enough that I got 2020 on one of the bille eilish songs!,
I mean it's fun but I play one song 😐 due to the fact that I realy didn't like the limited amount of songs. You should make it where you could add your own mp3,
When i play beat saber on mobile 1. Ads show up. 2 . Put no ads for 100 coins 3 . Put new updates. 4 . The leaderbored does not work for me. 5 . Playing the same songs when i get bored.,
"I love this game, although the controls are not good. Even though I did swipe, it didn't record it, so yeah..... 3 stars, but never the less, great game!",
"The game is good I guess but there is so mutch advertisement. After every round, the adds are Unskippebal. Really sad, game is like I said good I guess.",
Super good. But pls add more song and make a create your own song were you get to make a song yourself and etc to add the blocks and stuff bu overall the game is super good.,
When i had it downloaded it made my whole device laggy then when i played it i missed the cube by accident and then it just froze(i don't think i spelled it right)when i deleted it everything was fine and normal,
"It's really nice and relaxing and close to the vr thing. Also, I love playing it with freinds. The best and most common thing said was, ""Let's pretend I hit that-""",
I have never loved or seen a game like this! It is the best game I've ever owned! I love it so much im crying it has my favorite songs and I can hit the beat to it this s my #1 game now thank you so much for making it I was bored saw this game and have been playing it for 5 hours! I LOVE IT!,
I really like this game and the fact that you can add songs into it and all but could you make the difficulty harder plz and if im missing out that you can make the difficulty harder im sorry for making this review....,
This is a great game for people who like ads but if you don't like ads don't get this game its perfect game play but you breath just once and bam a ads pops up you Blinck a ad comes up the ads never stop and you cant exit out of them,
..wat it we could add our own songs.. Just a suggestion. But the game is really good but if y'all hate ads like me.. THERE'S AN AD AFTER EVERY ROUND,
"Ok amazing game but if there was more songs, the energy bar was fixed, and modifiers this would be a 5 star review.",
Its 100 times better now i can play it and it works but my only question is the things you swipe have nothing to do with the song they're just there.,
"I love this game its good that i am patient to rate bc i cant get this at first bc theres lives. The reason i gave it 4 stars bc when am playing in mobile i cant landscape, my hands cant fit on the screen!",
I'm giving this a three because whenever I hit a cube there's too many bright lights and it even makes me not able to see the next cubes after them which makes me miss them and lose health.,
It dosen't sense when u swipe!!! Such a bad game. I tried to do it again and again. Stupid game u.Might think I have a bad phone no is the games fault I wish i could rate it zero stars!!!!! FIX YOUR GAME!!!!!!!!!!,
Best game! But u need to add more songs I have been playing this 4 a while now and I have played all the songs way to many times plz add more songs.,
"Insanely fun game to play, it's like playing the real beat saber.. I'm so shocked. At first I hated the game but never uninstalled it, so now I just started playing it more often and I'm obsessed. I think everyone should play this game 👍👍👍👍",
I could not even start the first one to even play because of the fps(frames per second) were so low that i could almost not exit this was my exprence and i hope to whoever downloads this gets a better one,
The game is fun and the real beatsaber is £12.99 but the beat swiper game is really good and beat swiper is free so gave to 5 star if you do not have a vr or meta quest you could play this game,
If u want to play without ads just turn off you wifi,
This is if Beat Saber if it was an actual mobile app. The only thing that could make this better is if it had more songs. Possibly some you can download.,
NEVER MIND this app suck's I can't even play I swear I'm doing this correctly and it's still trash I'm swiping on the right time a this is not letting me something is wrong with ur game I even did it on my second phone and my tablet and it still do not work I dislike this app I don't NOT APPRECIATE 😡😡😡😡😡😡,
"The screenshots show a ""Play my song"" feature but that feature doesn't actually exist in the game. Absolutely hate the game until its put in",
The cubes would go across instantly making me lose its a major glitch,
"Well, the good part is this game has good audio quality, but, if you have ever played the VR version, do not put too much expectation on this game.",
There are some ads but they are skippable. Actually play like Beat saber and playable. Lot of songs (require unlock) Great graphic. Slash sound straight from Beat Saber.,
I have a galaxy s10 note plus one of the best phones atm and the app won't even stay open for more than 3 seconds. Waste of time.,
I think this a great game even if it is a copy of beatsaber but in my opinion it would be better if you also did the blocks like in beat saber (more 3D and shiny) but I would still recommend this game,
"Really good game, very similar to beatsaber i know it's not possible my idea but it would be cool to make the camera detect your hands and use them to cut the cubes",
When you swip the blocks it sometimes doesn't recognize that you even slashed that nlock and if you get 1 wrong you cant hit any more in that side untill you get a window pierod.,
The amount of ads is stupid and I was trying to play a level and it kept bringing up the how to play and that kept having to restart the nice game but the amount of ads is just unreal,
"Unfortunately, the beats and the game is way too easy for me, there are only a few notes per second and it is not immersive at all.",
Trash when im trying to record it always leave the game for no reason it does it when i try to play a song plus the cube behind the cube im supposed to hit said × also miss no sense at all,
I like it but it is very glitchy for instance when I try to swipe one of the block it doesn't fully connect so then I miss...,
Well i got this gane but i had to try it on my sisters phone because it was so laggy. Its an awsome app and the controls are smooth. Its just its really laggy on android.,
Was excited to play since I love beat saber but the audio is unbearable. I'm guessing they don't have rights to the actual songs. ROG Phone 3,
This game is similar to beat saber and I didn't encounter any bugs because I lowered the graphics and the game run smoothly I hope you'll add some songs like say so and ikon and probably add I see a dreamer too,
its sad how many people like this sad and bad game 1 when i was playing fat rat i can only swipe once and i couldnt use both thumbs 2 it costs so much just to get all these bad songs i clearly see the creator of this game has not tested it.,
I really love it but the only thing i hate is how i dont have much space to slide like it would be better if i could flip the screen sideways,
Well i do love this game but there is one problem is when i play the game it was ok and great but when everyday i play there is some called low energy and when i touch the watch ad it didn't open so pls fix it so i can play the game pls🥺i really love this game tnx.,
Too many ads and way to long for the ads. Lost my cool and uninstall it. Not worth it.,
Will not work. App opens and shuts off right after opening. Was a good game the one time I got it to work.,
Good. Nothing to compare it is the best version of Beat saber on the phone 📱.YAY!(Just add more songs unlocked at beginning)😎 🤑,
"I gave it a 4 because when i swipe it doesn't register but totally recommend it for people without a VR headset but acutally a good game! ""Bru!""",
I really love this game I enjoyed it a lot but the only problem I got is there's too much ad but I enjoy playing it and I am still wondering how do I add my own song to the app thanks a lot for making this game I appreciate it this app makes me wanna enjoy a lot now I found my happy place I am crying all the time because my old friends left me but now this game is my friend,
It's a fun game but it won't slice the block whenever I act like the laser play just goes right through it but it doesn't actually slice and count it as a miss,
Just sits there with no block coming to swipe. What's the point,
It's good. But can you add an option to put in a song that you downloaded? Or if you add more songs to the game. Because I'm getting bored of the songs that are in the game,
"To be honest with the creator, this game is good for people who have decent reaction time and is really fun to play but the swiping mechanism is kinda broken... please fix this",
"Probably one of the closest game to beat saber. But the songs are pretty limited, you cant add your own songs.",
"I appreciate the game, but was it really necessary to make the numbers in gameplay jumbo sized? (Try playing Alone in expert mode without being blinded by the numbers)",
Every time you do it correctly it counted wrong secondly it won't even let you tap it so you can actually get them right is when you hit them it says that you did not hit them getting your reporter is broken idiot do not play this game,
I would rate the game five starif I could actually see because all I can see is black and I can't see what I'm doing so I can you please fix that bug for computer/ laptop,
Hey i know i like this game but the ADS is alot. like seriously fix it but i liked it tho the graphics and the beat i liked it but im giving it 4 stars becuase of the ads.,
Best Port of Beat Saber available on Mobile! It would be better if there was an option for faster cubes and cubes were more accurate!,
"The game is fun but i hit the blocks but it said missed i did not missed it but i guess is my fault again is a fun game it has good quality and plz put a ""add your own song"" to be more fun",
"Really fun game, I would definitely recommend this to people who can't afford Beat Saber. Also pretty impressed on how you got the two Sabers into the game. Very impressive",
I love but there is this freeze that occurs alot I don't know why its happening... After i finish a song the screen terns black with heat hitpoints showing downwards..... Hope u fix it,
"Was fun when it worked the first time. Can't open the app anymore or when I do, freezes or just crashes.",
"Sucks super laggy, stopped registering my finger swipes half way through the song twice. Deleted it not even 5 mins after downloading it.",
Love it Just needs a little work on some new songs and steady frames per second on expert plus levels,
It's so glitchy that I can't even play it.,
Itmdoesbt regester half my swipes unreponsive laggy doesnt clerify if the green bar is ur life or were thats were ur supposed to swipe above i was honeslty exited to try this game after reading the reviews and it has great songs and all but over all not that enjoyabe,
the songs don't even start when you start trying to play one. terrible.,
Incredibly awesome music with how many vibrations that just go through your head and make you want to sing!!😊😊👍,
I could not even open the game!!!!! I have a S9. This is not a performance problem. It's a game problem. Don't even ask to increase my rating just because you don't want your +4 rating to do down.,
It is a really good game it's just like beat saber and I enjoy it it's a bit hard to do levels due to ads but I enjoy it thank you for creating such a amazing game,
Pretty good But I found that half way through the game would stop letting me hit the blocks and I would normally happen with about 30 seconds left,
I can't even play every time I load the app up 5-10 seconds in it crashes over and over even after reinstalling the game,
"Doesn't work at all. I start a song and no audio, no blocks, nothing.",
This is an amazing game!!The latest update made it almost like the VR beat saber!! And makes it WAY more in joyable!! Keep up the updates for more songs please!!😁😁😁,
I accually liked it but wished for better controls like rather than being at bottom of the screen just make tapping at the middle of the screen,
Terrible. Literally so many ads. Not remotely like beat saber. And literally they appear like 2cm away from the screen giving you barely anytime to hit them! Fix all these and maybe more people will like your game.,
I like how there are three modes in this game it helps the player develop there reflexes I think it's as the vr version (beat saber) and this is why I think it deserves five stars,
Hello and this game is smooth enough for me and its good also update it make it even more realistic add like bombs and Free moving hands with light sabers could that be ok overall good game,
"This is really fun and my sister seems to enjoy it but for me I'm a little curious because when I decided to play ""first date"" my phone started to crash so can you make the first date song be available to play? Your app is awesome!",
It's so laggy and it freezes in the middle of the game. If your gonna copy and game actually try.,
Playing with half，it difficult to control . I have a lot of miss and lose the game.,
Relly like a 2d version of beat sabers But the gameplay is kinga laggy and the blocks are invisible.can you make it abit laggy and make the block to visible mode thank you.,
This was so bad it was laggy and too fast not the tipe of game i would play also the songs were weird and not cool like the songs i listen to i have no words it was not good at all for me another thing is that it would say i missed although i hite it and when you miss it would make a weid and crepy sound i wish i could make a zero👎🤮,
"Good game, but some of the beats are off, also not a lot of music choices. Another than take greate game.",
The game's controls are awful and I feel really uncomfortable when I'm swiping half of the time it doesn't respond to swiping at all,
I dont know why people hate your game but I like it they dont understand that this game is good I dont care about the adds I like it and some people are being mean but I hope u get more 5 stars ok ♡. I like the songs and things . But people should be grateful for the game. But cool game.🤩😘😍😊😇🥳👍,
Its is a copy of beat saber BUT its a good copy.,
"Very cool, just like the br version, I hope I get a PC that can run it and a vr set but till then this will do more than satisfy",
I think this game is good but not as good as VR beat sabers beat sabers is more like virtual Reality first person game but this game is also good and the controls are easier than in vr headset,
This game is awesome. It has lots of different songs and some song are quite challenging.,
"Want to replay a song? An ad plays, Wanna unlock songs without wasting coins? An Ad Plays? Wanna go to the song menu? AN AD PLAYS!!! REMOVE THE ADS, AND ADD MORE SONGS DAILY",
When i play beat swiper it dint show the colors and i uinstall and install ist still no colors . When i swipe the block it show a big number end sometimes it crashed,
"This game is just amazing you should download it i mean its free, its got great graphics, its OFFLINE all free songs , its just to good",
"Boring, very minimal songs that you mostly have to pay for. And 97% of the blocks are off beat and not necessary",
Im going to give it a 4 because when i tried a song and i did one of the blocks it completely crashes the game.,
"the songs were so slowed it was creepy and when I tried playing the cubes were invisible and it signalled that I ""missed"" them but they never appeared",
"Good app! But it could use a level editor, it's really fun to play. I have the real beat saber and it's a good replica of the game, nice app man!",
LET ME PLAY THE GAME PLZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and I like this game because it looks like the real beat saber ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️😍😍😍😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠 this game I don't like it cuz it lags too much even though I hit the targets it doesn't count it so I don't like it that much at least make it more better like real beat saber so you can move the camera please make it update. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠,
i cant even swipe... edit: oh nvm haha theres a low graphic setting but theres a bug where i cant swipe any blocks since two blocks were stuck in the screen,
It is not that good cause when I downloaded it and started playing the cubes didn't show up and it said I missed it but the cubes didn't even came and there arent many songs so 1 start,
This is a really enjoying game. It's feels so satisfying when we swipe the cubes with the rythm of the song. I really enjoyed it,
"I love this game, so many songs. My only request is can you add the song Ramalama Bang Bang by Rosin Murphy? It's super catchy and I feel it would match best with the game",
I admit it's fun but most of the time it plays but the cubes does not come through and also some in the cubes stickes tkt he screen so j can't see pls fix this,
I like it but the only reason i wrote it 4 stars its because the green 30 sign in the screen annoys me and it hurts my eyes.but overall the game is good.,
It's such a good copy it's really cool i love the music and the details i think you guys are the best at this game making please keep up the good work,
READ WHOLE THING This app is absolute garbage.Honestly you can't do anything and its soøõòöóô laggy.IT CANT BE PLAYED.unless im guessing you have a really good phone then this app is probably really fun and enjoyable.,
This is a great app dont get me wrong but I cant go more than one song without the game completely crashing.,
I get that they tried really hard but its not that great its so bright and the points cover the whole screen.,
"It's only a good game if you put the graphics on low, it makes it not lag, but once you do that it's good practice.",
I love this game but it gitch everyday when i start play when i lose red and blue thing stick to the screen and yea that is my problem pls fix it thank you,
"This game so cool! It almost same with VR beat saber and I love the vibration when swiped the beat, other app doesn't have this.",
Didn't always register I swiped when I did. Also the cubes weren't in time with the music.,
"It's decent. It's pretty slow, and i wish there a lot of other songs to be added. Overall a good game",
"Most songs on here are generic things that you hear on the radio , wish you could map your own things.",
"I don't like it, it says it doesn't contain ads but then an ad pops up and the beats dont even go with the timing its poorly made",
It's not really positioned right (woyld rether play it at a top view than letting it come to me) I cant even reach the ones at the side,
It was super fun I had no bad experience in it was not lucky at all I love the vehicle one ad per day I love it so much you should play,
Great! but would be awsome with more songs so please make more songs. that would be amazing!,
This game is amazing and it's just like the real thing on your device its awesome! Keep up the good work Beat Swiper!,
The music is not starting,
This game has so much potential its really coll and the songs are nice but the only problem I have with this game is the lag and it honestly ruins this game for me. Please fix the lag,
"It is hapening whan i'm playing.But this app is also amazing,besides that.You did a great job.Keep doing what you do and you will be more successful!Thanks for attencion!",
Realy good app. At first i could not see tje aroes and then i turned down the quality and it is fine. Plz fix that though and i will rate 5 star,
In campagne level 1 the hit stop registering mid way of the song and doesn't detect hits at all.,
I hate this game it was not a good idea to make it It glitches all the time which is why I hate it also goes right past you all the time.,
On the last review I meant laggy not large. Ok the ads are so long it keeps saying I missed the squares nobody download this i have no idea why people like this it sucks,
Amazing! It's so fun if you don't like ads turn off your mobile data and no adds! I love the game so much! So funnn😄😀😁,
It's a little laggy when it comes to expert plus and also pls approve and add more songs that are black pink songs that are made by bands and stuff,
This game have a bug.... the square colour doesn't show up.. so its a bit hard to play..all the song are okay..,
"I really love it, i didn't get it at first but then i read the instructions again, and i was like "" oh my gos, i am so blind "" There was no add for me, i really lived it.",
"Fun game, lots of ads but good. Maybe add a one saber mode where you use one finger like in the VR game Beat Saber. This is just like Beat Saber but on mobile.",
It's just hard to play when I swipe at a box big number just cover the screen so u miss half of the boxes cause you can't see,
Id give it a 0 but i cant anyways when you miss all the boxes they stack up on your screen and the left saber stops working i dont recommend downloading this game,
Do not let the lack of ads in the thing deceive you. It's a good game but this game CONTAINS ADS.,
Its actualy better than i thought buuuuuuuuuut...don't get suprized i got a headache of ads but its beat saber but without trillions and trillion and on and on of songs plus i play without the tumb,
"It's a cool app until you finished all the hard ones, try making a even harder difficulty like ""extreme"".",
It's a good game but when u get so many wrong the cubes get glitching and u can't hit the cubes anymore and also to many ads,
It doesn't have fnaf songs+ ITS WAY HARD THEN OCULOS DIMBY,
Can't even play. Just crashes. I'll stick to regular Beat Saber with my VR headset. At least it works.,
I love it it is just like beat saber but it's not br and you have to spend coins get music on there witch I love so much!!!!!!!,
App crashes almost instantly when opened on galaxy s9. App updated and reinstalled and same thing.,
My experience was amazing but I'm not sure about the sync in the game but other than that it's an a amazing game.,
I like it a lot becous it is actualy hard and it reminds me of beat saber but portable and it dose not have as much songs you should add songs☺,
Beat swiper is bugging out 1 star and i cant even see were the arrow and i got stuck at the tutorial fix it and i will give it a higher raiting,
I give 2 stars because this would be enjoyable but the reason is cause the arrows dissapear after slicing the first cube even without invisible arrows on it still disapears,
I added another star because they have improved the performance but they took away the part that was good about the game THE CUSTOM SONG SECTION.also if your not gonna add it back at least add more songs or bring the custom song back,
"The Swiping doesn't work. When it's time to swipe, I swipe, doesn't work. Your game is trash. Get a life you Moron",
I love the game but when I have no more life I just stay in the game but cannot cut witch makes it kinda nnoying when so can you fix it pls?,
"This game is terrible. Oh my gosh I want to prevent all people about to instialle this to STOP. Dont give them the player, they dont deserve to have people playing this game all these ads on this app are ridiculous every single time you die, you get hit a with a terribe disgusting long-lasting ad. The game is laggy, please dont",
I will give it a three it doesn't really work out for me... Because it's so hard to read it when you're on a tiny electronic.,
I gave it a 4 cuz it's cool its just like beat saber but a hate after a song when u go back to home every time it shows a ad and I hate but I love the game -jay5tg 4-15-31 10:14,
when i opened the app for the first time i was excited and then it glitched and was just a bkack screen. tried re opening didnt wprk dont get this app,
"This game has a good idea, but it does not process my swips. Also it does not have any of the songs that I really care for.",
"Its got latency and it takes for ever for the game to register anything, the notes end up hitting about a second after you swipe",
Downloaded. Played one song. Uninstalled because there were ads that were 30s long. That's too long,
I had this app before then deleted it because I never used it. Now I downloaded it today and opened it then it just closed. Please fix it because in the past I really enjoyed it.,
This game it terrible I was playing a song and I missed every single one even tho they were on the green line that's when your sopposed to hit them it's a ripoff verson,
Yeah i mean its cool because if you don't have a headset you can't really play beat saber but its bad it could be better,
"Really good, I don't have a vr headset to play the actual beat saber, but this is just like it, but on mobile.",
"If you're at home during quarantine, and want to play Beat Saber but don't have VR, just play this game. 5 Stars, best mobile game ever.",
"Great game not super easy not super hard either, i love all the levels, i just love everything all around amazing game!",
Its just good but it seems to run very slow but i feel like thats just a phone thing not the game but either way keep up the great work,
Its so glitchy. Sometimes swipes doesnt register and you miss every single one especially expert and expert+,
"Poor design, the game makes it difficult to see the direction and doesn't always register the swipe",
The game just trash it supposed to be better but the game just have something wrong like the song is stop for no reason and lot more... FIX IT NOW,
when i first went into the gam the screen was black all was nothing but there was music playing in the background so yeah i dont know. Aayway i decided to unistall it,
I really like this game you should get it it is just that it needs a function so you can put in your own songs and not have to play the song that they give you,
Played this game for a while bit recently experienced a bug where the app loafs but then just shuts down. Is there going to be q fix for this?,
Outstanding game you just want to play on low graphics it make everything smoother and they still look great,
this game is awesome game for sure i give this 5 stars in a row lesss goooo this is awesome because im just like real playing in this game you dont know its awesome this game is my dream to play but reality so thank you so much madeing this and i have many levels well sometimes it lagging so thank you🤙🤙👍👍,
It literally has like 10 irrelevant songs and you can't even play songs from your playlist. App is trash,
Its amazing. Espassily with headphones. All i would change is having to pay for infonet lives.👍,
Its a lot like best saber but without vr very good but the ads are unskippable and 30 seconds it gets really annoying please update this,
the game is buggy as hell and also you have 100 ads per second. it's impossible to play,
The games lags a lot and usually I can't swipe my screen. Graphics could also use some updating,
I like it but can you add swords in or something like that that would be awesome if they can do that cuz I really think it would be really cool,
I was having fun but the game doesnt work when i hit the blocks or beats nothing happens and yes im hitting them correctly but still its not a good game for me,
When I played a level it was bad because when I swiped one it wouldn't let me I swiped 5 times and it didn't work so it said I missed it when I didn't if that didn't happen I would rate it 5 stras,
The game is ok at first then the game does not show the up down and free cut its all blank and the bolcks stack up please fix all of this,
Wow my friends always told me im not good at these types of games so i sent them a clip of me finnishing unity in expert+ very nice just the ads are anoying From:me,
"This game is good if you don't have vr or want to play beat saber. My first experience of this game was good, it's like beat saber of the screen was small",
"It is fun and addictive I play all the time the adds don't come often so I don't mind, it's a great app you should definitely get it 🌻✨",
I would rate it 3 stars until me get the bug fixed where the game does nof regisyer both sides if this was fixed it would be 5 stars ok i rated it 4 stars because i see you tried to make mobile beat saber,
"This is wonderful! I dont see any flaws! It's a lot like beat saber, which is cool cuz I can't afford it ;3 Thank you so much for making this game!!",
First of all this is a beat saber copy and 2nd of all why the blocks are soo slow and 3 everytime I end a level I get an add and again an add and the same add like wth is this?,
It is very fun. But I think it is more fun for the players to upload the musics that they like and use them.,
Great game everything is easy to control and a very challenging and adictive game.,
"not at all intuitive and very crowed on screen, not very responsive either",
I loved this game..! Ao much entertaining..! Only doubt is why it's even getting only 3.8 rating..! Add more music..! That one suggestion too..! Best game,
Awsome they should add to the search that you can search up any song. Though thanks for the updates!,
I love the real game. This one is way too buggy and half of the time it wont even let me hut them.,
I gave it a 1-star rating be cuz whenever you miss it stays there it doesn't go past you and that annoys me so that's why I rate it one star.,
Don't download it is so hard to hit it plus you have to pay real money for the good songs all you get is old tiktok music,
I would rather play the actual game for $30 I can even do expert Plus without dying once I only played this game for like 1 minute this game sucks just play the actual game if you have enough money,
This game is sooo soo good a copy of beat saber mobile version and I request if that i can add some songs from my phone and you can add a bigger song gallery,
Too many adds in my opinion and also the music gets glitchy also its too easy I'm able to do godzilla on expert+ and I just started,
Wish I could give zero stars! I went into the app right when it finished downloading and it just brought me back to the app store!,
It's a good game but could you add some Gorillaz songs like feel good inc or cracker island,
Love the game but keeps crashing after watching the ads,
I could have given it 5 stars but the graphics need some some work. Try bringing more songs Then you will see how much better it is,
There was ads every second and I couldn't even slice the blocks because there was not enough space for my thumbs,
Its addicting and fun but I wish it can fix the crashes it sometimes makes.,
Great game but I wish you could have the ability to pick your one song made by the community or just songs,
This is now way better. No lag. But the double swipes sometimes dont register.,
This game is so unresponsive it doesn't work when I'm swiping and then when I miss the blocks cover up my screen,
Im obsessed 😍😍😍 but it cant upload my own songs from my own playlist but i still give it 5 stars! YOU should download this app!!!,
Greate game it is literaly beatsaber on mobile I would like a wider rane of songs and less adds but the adsds just pop up of your screen you dont have to wach anything please get it,
It is really fun and it's a great game if you don't have the Oculus Quest. I love playing the game and you should download it!,
Well maybe if they add more music it can be playable I've all ready played all the music and it's really lagy please fix the lag,
It is fun but sometimes i get lost from the controls. Please fix it and i love the game?,
This is a good game it had some bug problems though it delays your swipe and it's really annoying,
The onlupy problem is when I run out of harts the game gust stops responding until the end of the song.,
This so mush cool but some songs I don't know so this app is good and its graphics are also good and its easy!!,
On my phone (kokomo) the game is amazing! It had all pop songs and I like em sunflower is in to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Terrific game.,
I only gave this a one-star rating because the game is broken Whenever I try to slice at a certain point it doesn't let me slice it And then the blocks just don't come at me It doesn't make sense Can you please fix this If you fix this I might download this game again Just please I have a oculus quest But my brother Emily loves me on At a certain time So please fix this I want to play this so it feel like I'm actually playing beats saber,
Horrible touch detection ads at ever corner and terrible music selection!!! Terrible,
It is very good except for the numbers covering the screen when slicing the blocks,
Good game for me only 4star coz it has only limited musics to play For me I suggest that u can use your music on your phone and I suggest too to have a expert+++,
Need option to change cube speed and need better mapping,
"It doesnt register most of my swipes. Good game idea, but overall not really playable..",
"The game is really good, but when I downloaded this game, I didn't see custom music, can you fix it? Thanks.",
"When you swipe it does a green thing that takes up your entire screen, so you can't see what you are doing",
"It's gud, it's like the real game, but, keep it coming, do more song, I like hard bass tbh, good luck to the devs in this games, nice game, 5/5 score from me",
I can't play anything anymore. It tells me I have to watch an ad but when I click watch. It doesn't do anything.,
Amazing but it would be cool for an update were you swipe it looks like an lightsaber red an blue and maybe xbox controller controls great app,
"game is buggy,the cubes suddenly pop up past the line and i just instantly miss,and the audio is broken",
Pretty dang addicting I mean there's quite a bit adds but you get used to them quick and there might be lag but idk that's just me,
This game is like beat saber but it is hard to hit the notes on the side because they are kind of screen.,
Hey I still think the levels could be much harder expert plus is pretty easy peasy try make expert plus harder or add harder options,
I would rate this five stars if it wasnt for one glitch where the audio is delayed or just missing in general,
Beat Swiper is an amazing game. It is so much fun and there is also no glitches.,
"The audio was horrible, the response was bad, and the cubes did not load until the went past the line",
The game was super laggy and when i hit the notes it never counted as a hit and always a miss but the first one always gives me a hit,
Keeps crashing for Samsung galaxy S9 phone can't even stay in the app for like even 5 seconds all my other applications have no issues,
Glichy but the best game ever i would play this every day but i cant downlod it back i just got this phone and i cant now but still the best! Keep up the beat work,
"Absolute trash,the controls suck because it doesn't respond to pretty much anything.",
the gamr isnt tha bad but !!!! when i swap with my tow fingers it glitchs so i cant play but awsome try put flip screen mode Hey did you fix it,
"Bad game, bad look and no sound effects when swiping the beats, add sound effects and I change my review",
I do like it but it's kinda lagging for me and I fix the settings and not bad but if I hit it on the I forgotten what's it could but if we hit it it's shows like money like this $3 like that so fix it please and fix the lagg and also fix the ads please 🙏🙏🙏🙏,
"Ok graphics. Not phone friendly. But props on the completely ""ORIGINAL"" idea!",
It's super good game I love it I just hate the ads that pop up every two seconds,
It is a very good game. U should also play this. The reason why I didnt give it 5 stars is i would like if it had more songs. Otherwise it is very good.,
I can tell its a good game but what i hate about it is that i cant hit the boxes i only hit it once and by the time i get to a other one its game over bc i cant hit it.,
I love it but one problem is that you have to have a search bar for songs and add more songs,
Could you uhm stop showing so much ads like you dont have to really worry It only shows ada throughout the hole game but I bet you dont know anything about that because Its all about getting money,
"This app is great but can you add some songs like Alan Walker's song ""End of time"" And other singers",
"The tiles didn't even appear, I thought this was the perfect alternative for beat saber but its not...",
The touch controls aren't even sensitive. Everytime i swipe it says miss.,
"This game is great, but there's one problem. There is no option to add in your own songs, whys that?",
Its great but .... i wish there where more cool stuff like dance monkey crybaby End other stuff but its kinda boring and is not the same as the REAL beat saber ;-;,
It's almost like the actual beat saber but on phone my only wish is to have a bigger selection of music,
its a good attempt but its glitchy and won't really recognize when you swipe to break the blocks :/,
Horrible. I can't even launch the game as when I try it just closed instantly. PLEASE FIX,
Where's the play your own song setting here and the lights in the picture of the description its not totally like those pictures,
I'm trying to download one song my WiFi works perfectly and it says no Internet connection also when I saved to buy music I bought one it used my money but didn't give me music,
"I mean,on VR its different i thought it was u can pick any song you want and it wasnt that fun either, i recommend dont download this",
"It would get have gotten 5 stars if it would let me download my songs besides the same one, the rest is awesome. Now I cant add any of my music.",
I like the app but it keeps coming off the app in the middle of a game...can you please see if there is something wrong with app.,
I love this game is so addictive but I do have a request can you add more songs as I don't know how to download music,
Graphics are deformed i cant see platform and cubes only arrows so i uninstalled and reinstalled but it only wasted my data because its same so i only uninstalled,
Awesome i love staring at a black screen and listening to the background music so like the real game,
This is the worst game and way to many ads and when i hit one it dosent work and the lag is the worst thing ever one star,
Well back then there were like 10 songs and no campaign and i didnt have a vr head set i played again and it had campaign and i had no vr headset today i found the game again and i have a quest 2 i like your game it just like beatsaber but uh yea heh even tho ill play real beatsaber,
I love it and some songs suggestions: Wolf in sheep's clothing by set it off Cradles Ty for reading hehe a great day or night,
"It's a nice remake for phone users, but these maps are just horrible.",
Wow its very good looks like VR its very easy with expert+ all the levels its easy in there is challenging,
I'm not changing this review until you fix your damn game the blocks stack up and they don't let you hit the other ones this is the worst ripoff ever,
the quality of the game sucks and it has a glith where the block gets stuck as you watch them pile up id rather just buy the oculus,
This game awsem the hard is expert + but I belated if and there is no more hard modes like super hard imossiple hyper omgega ultra super impossible sorry I have to 2 stars,
This game is very boring and is not sensitive to touch so it makes it hard to destroy the blocks.,
I love the game its just puts the points you got on the screen i cant quite see what side its supossed to be.,
Best songs ever! Probably the best music game to. The songs are the best please add more:),
Its not that bad its great! But It has very little songs but everything else Is great!!,
I love how and this is an actual thing! Not as great as the VR one but it does the job! I love it!,
Would be better if less lag. Also the cubes don't light up until they are in your face,
Oh my god this game is cool but when we start its onoying cus it lagging Yeah it like stop and if you play this ou intalled make sure you dont lag if its lag unistalled it,
It is so cool because it's just like beat saber and your able to do it on any device.😁😁,
This game is okay but the only thing is when I try to play faster car it won't let me swipe on the notes and the other songs to,
I gave this game a one-star because when you miss it gets stuck on your screen and eventually you won't be able to press anything,
I gotta say this is not bad for a rip off beat saber its actually one of those good rip off beat saber games the reason i give it a 4 star is because of course its the ads,
It's still it has a lot of sex and adds you can't skip them and the controllers are allfull,
"Charts are very off beat, and the game is just not made for phones.",
This game has so much potential and is so much fun but it takes way to long to register the hits and it's so annoying because it's so much fun,
"for some reason, the audio is EXTREMELY delayed and glitched.",
The app is absolutely amazing! But i would like if theres more songs :),
Four stars because it logs sometimes and it won't touch anything and also it kicks me out when ever it logs so please fix that promblem,
"Not perfect but the best Beat Saber mobile port, should have landscape mode I saw your response, thanks for listening",
I love this game! could you also add more songs? there are only 17. I gave 5 starts to encourage you:),
"The game is good and all but, I hope for more songs and easier controls",
"It goes to much to the edge of the screen, can't even register the swipes",
Its so lagy i cant even play the game can you fix that and the controls dont work that well they keep truning off,
crashes by start up can de the turtorial and thats it black screen its a fun game (if u can play it) :(,
It was good but the levels for campaign are too hard the disappearing block go away to fast,
"Very good,this is the best beat saber mobile game I've ever played,however the ads are pretty annoying",
"You guys are terrible. My friend said she was only able to do half of a song because it wouldn't register her touch, and all you said in your reply was that it must be her device AND YOU ACTUALLY TRIED TO GET HER TO GIVE YOU MORE THAN 1 STAR! You said and I quote ""as you see we have +4 rating . Sorry Again. Please don't decrease our average rating with 1 star. give us more stars please"" ALL the typos in the above quote were made in your responce. PLEASE LEARN to take critism and IMPROVE.",
It is very laggy some songs and my swiping doesnt register half the time.,
It gud and just like the vr gam note:play on landscape but has too many ads other wise it would be 5 stars,
It is a great game but is still needs a little work but hopefully will probably get updated in the future,
"Disgusting, unacceptable, usless, glitchy, Everything! DO NOT DOWNLOAD It is SOO bad Doesn't even work and made my phone 2fps! Forever",
Awful control interface when swiping blocks as no sense of range you can hit it at,
The notifications dont stop but its challenging fun and runs nice with good graphics,
I love it 💗💜 but there is way too many ads so that Is the reason why I rate it a 4 but i recommend u to play it😃,
"Decently well made, almost like an official beat saber port. The lag is an issue though",
Like it:)The game are awesome but the graphics are trouble but seriously it's a nice games.,
"A bit annoying with being kicked out randomly, otherwise, really fun!",
It looks good but thing is.. how do you move the hand..i just gave it 3 stars beacuse it really doesnt work..,
Super game but you can increase screen size it is hard to slice the dice in small area,
1 thing. Add custom songs. I dont care if it will be online. I just want custom songs.,
"Pretty nice game, just wish that there was a custom song option or like play songs from YouTube.",
I love how the game always makes new songs to play and it has a lot of interesting music,
I would love this game if it wasint so glichy needs a bug fix then this game would be playable,
The songs are not in sync with the blocks. I play beat saber myself.,
"Its a really good game but the only thing is that you cant get custom songs witch pisses me off,But its a really good game👍",
"Bruh just off ur internet so the ads won't pop out, even though I haven't tried it's gonna be great!!!",
Could be better if you could choose the color of the cubes but other than that it is great,
The game is good but there's too many adds I would rate a 5 if there would be no adds!!!!!,
Pretty Nice!The Songs Are The Best The Graphics is fine and I Like How this game turns out!,
"You can't see The Beat Things,it lags from the flashing light to much and I just lag out.im just saying Make It better like the vr one",
"Ads are unskipable, to few songs and, too easy.",
I LOVED THIS GAME this game is really fun and when ever i really wanna play beat saber iplay this game but i do have a recommendation can you make expert a little bit harder please?,
Its good but the fov is suck i cant swipe at the end of my phone of we can change the big of the thong need to swipe ar the camera zoom and zoom out rhis would be very good game,
It's ok... just 1 it's not on beat. 2 I don't really like the way that you have to slice certain ways,
The game keep freezing and kicking me out I I think it's an good idea but yeah..,
"Cant describe my hate to this off brand mobile game. It's so bad, please owners of Beat Swiper delete your game and give everyone a favor. PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE. The on brand game is Beat Saber, a virtual reality game.",
I love the game it's a really good time spender but when I hit the cubes the way it wants me to it say that I missed it but I hit it other than that it's a really good game I recommend it,
the game is glitched whenever I mess up the game doesn't count my misses or doesn't make me restart,
"Game is trash if you play on a tablet cause even when you slah, it won't say that you slashed it and you keep failing until you DIE.",
Good time passer and addictive would like more songs or be able to choose my own if possible in an update,
This game is really fun aoon as i start to know how to do the peedext i just was starting to keep better and better its almost the best game i played,
the game is really good but everytime I finish a song it goes black and I cant do anything,
"Way too laggy, and keeps saying I miss even when the blocks Don't reach the line.",
Good one thing I don't like is there's not beat saber songs and change when u want to add music make though Google drive thx,
Now that I have gotten my answer I can rate this a huge 5 star game. Highly recommended the game to anyone who can't have beat saber VR.,
I really like the effort and work they put into this I am having a BLAST! -Audingding,
This is like best saber! It's really fun. I don't really care about the ads.,
Very bad never really worked for me. Should fix the issue with the two finger swipping,
The concept is cool but I think you need to add vr and vr controller functionality,
I missed one block in the tutourial and this game is already broken. I wish I could give this 0 stars.,
wont even work when i tried to get on and the screen is always black.,
"Sucks it too hard for certain phones, its just a knock off of the real one.",
Love it. Wish there was more directions and can you add the song natral from imagin dragons,
It's a good game because it's a tablet/ phone game instead of VIRTUALLY REALITY and I don't have VR so I like it,
"Great game. Not many song choices, but lots of types.",
Its pretty fun! Probs with it a little bit is that its a little bit glitchy for me.But its ok!,
I just love this game to play. This game is so amazing and wonderful to play and plz imstall some new songs like of justin bieber plz intall his songs ...👌👌,
I expected it to just be a normal ad bombarding game but this actually has some time put into it,
"I like it but it gliches but it,s ok. And I have to restart the game to fix it",
I like this but i always get ads when i finish it please fix this problem owners,
Has ads that are 30 seconds long and the gameplay doesn't feel smooth,
"Really smooth and lighting is amazing. Great game, would recommend it for sure",
It's good but the cut sound is delayed and out of sync,
Whenever i open the game it just closes and i tried reinstalling it but it did not work.,
I like the game but there are so many glitches and half of the time I can't swipe the blocks,
It's ok but it has this green light everytime you hit a block but the songs are good,
I only had to have it on vr to love it but playing on a tablet is harder but it is still addictive i play it a lot it is so fun I garinte you should get it😁❤❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍,
I play beat saber alot on Vr and this is pretty close to it it's fun Adds it's okay Normal All I have to say and also if you don't likes adds don't,
I just love playing the app in general and love how you can select what mode/speed/hardness of it you would like,
Ok so it's good but there are not many songs I mean there are a lot and it's really glitchy,
This is a lie! after i download it i dont know where is the custom songs button they have to fix this,
This game loaded after a while but then I pressed a song to play and it wouldn't work/load.,
Garbage. Laggy and horrid graphics. I would not recommend.,
This game is great and the ads a tolorable theusic is good and I love the different modes,
This game is quite a fun rythym game and is like a mobile Beat Saber. It also has lots of songs.,
I think you should add a search bar because if someone's song is in there and it's very deep the down they have to scroll for a couple million years,
If you go in campaign mode then press the arrow you will find settings where you can turn the graphic to normal option,
Best game I have ever played really it's really good and if you can please add a leave that's really hard that would be very fun Again very good 5 stars,
Really Awesome. OMG! It gives you the actual feeling of the BEAT SABER! Loved this game.,
it was very glitchy and very time I would try to play it wouldn't work.,
This is terrible i can't even do the notes up and down for the combo also very terrible ao delete this,
"Does not start at all, when I launch the app it just takes me out right after I launch it.",
I love it but... the adds need to be lowered down. THERE ARE WAY too many adds,
I used to like this game but then I got rid of it when I got it again I couldn't see the arrows it's strange,
So bad it's so out of sync and when I hit the tile perfect it still says ur bad,
Horrable its sucks so bad and wenever i swipe at the blocks to cut them it never registers this game is trashy and falty i wold never reccomend it to annybody,
I love it! The only thing that I would like you to add is the ability to import songs from your device.,
"Does not say ""contains ads"" and I still got a random ad for no reason.",
It crashes. Doesn't get past the loading screen.,
Really good game! The only problem I have is that the game crashes a lot,
I could not focus as a green light keep flashing and the game did not have any songs I like,
I feel like this os not normal but the game dosent want to instal it always says Pending... But never actually instals the game. PLS fix this.,
Most awesome game ever I'm 35 YEARS OLD AND I LOVE THIS GAME(by the way this is a REAL comment not a bot comment)its just like the VR one.,
This is just a Beat Saber rip off. The name Beat Swiper THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE WORD. This has to be one of the worst games.,
It actually like beat saber which is pretty cool i just want one thing added if you can add maybe we don't talk anymore by Charlie PuthAnd Selena Gomez,
"It is exactly like Beat Saber, just not in vr. The controls and better than I imagined it would be",
The blocks are not working properly they are clear and the arrows are floating Plz fix this.,
I cant even see the screen when i swipe a block it make the game hard coz it makes numbers block the screen,
New updates are giving a very distorted sound for all music.,
When i slash a cube it doesnt do it. So i must say this was a waste if my time. If u do mind to fix this i might raise it up to a 5 star,
I really like this game!! At first it was hard but slowly I got to learn and had lots of fun!!,
Its bad when i got it i thought ispt was actually beat saber but no it was beat swiper why do i think its bad? The controls are terrible,
"A bit hard, but thats what I like in a game A few ads are nothing A very good game 👌",
When there is blocks in the middle I couldn't swipe it bc my fingers are big so can you please fix that,
"I like it very much but I would like it to have k pop songs like from black pink,bts,itzy...",
The game works. It's just the song selection is kinda whack.,
i rated 1 star because the photos are from beat saber and there is so many bugs and the beats dont even go with the beat of the songs,
This game sucks i can't hit double notes and basically any notes i hate this game it's the worst beat saber rip off ever it's sucks and its really laggy,
It keeps crashing when it's done loading so please fix that and I'll give 5 stars,
Lights too bright too see anything and it doesn't pick up ur movement.,
How do u even play dude u can not just use two fingers and have them fhaze through each other lmao u can not even put two fingers right next to one another withouth the game glitching out,
Worst game ive ever tried. Doesnt do anything after first cube. And they even contacted me and asked me to change my review. DO NOT BOTHER TO DOWNLOAD,
I love it! Its like beat saber but on a phone. I'm glad you guys made the game since theres people like me can't afford beat saber.,
Total rip off its laggy and glitchy and when I die it freezes this game is so bad,
Too many lags! What an absolute trash! Songs are lagging HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO ENJOY THE GAME!,
Yeah this game is bad there are many bus about this game when you slice the the beats it doesn't even slice some time,
"I give this app 4 stars is because, the swipes don't go with the beat.Other than that it's a good game.",
The only bad thing is that when u try to start a game there's like a 50 50 glance it will freeze,
Was able to play one map but then the game kept closing or shutting down as i tried to get back on,
"This may be the best music game i have ever played, i loved beat saber and now i love this.",
Amazing game needs more songs really want the song seven nation army by the white stripes 👍👍👍,
"Its broken for me, the audio is slow motion so i cant play properly please fix it for me",
Its good in all but fix the graphics and this is a RIP-off of beat saber,
I have played many games music games but there was one game I love which is best saber which is vr and I don't have vr and this is the closest thing to that game Highly recommended for those who love beat saber,
It's fun but it lags somtimes but I restart the game when it does and then it works fine,
"This game is still amazing but the custom song option are gone, what happened to it?",
Game did not load for me and just saying for other computer and pc players do not play this on it because it will probally not work,
Just OP. Hats off to u guys.👏👏It almost feels like playing beat saber.The closest and the most fabulous beat saber type game.Once again salute to u guys.👏👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉,
Tutorial is bad if you miss even one of the blocks the game freezes up,
I thought it would be fun and all but it won't let me hit anything its really annoying,
to many ads and on expert and expert + its hard to even hit any of them fix it please its annoying,
"This is a lawsuit waiting to happen, copyrighted ip, tons of copyrighted music and tons of ads. Also to whoever made this game your music taste is awful.",
Its trash the swipe timeing its not even good soo much latency in it when i swipe on my screen i cannot cut it in time. It's still nothing changed make the timeing better and i change my mind but right now still 1* for me to the game,
The game literally just crashes 10 seconds after opening every time,
Im really good like REALLY GOOD but there are soooo many ads im giving it only 4 for the ads,
"Amazing app,not to mention,most of my favorite songs r on here so, great",
Add these modes Easy/Normal/Hard/Expert/Expert+/Expert++/Expert+++ And add this song : Reality Check Through The Skull,
Its a very cool game and i like it alot i highly recommend this game if you like rhythm type games,
It is awesome just like real beat saber .. But please add more songs please...,
Its more fun then beat saber thanks developer for the game 8 love it. This is Khoo Zhi Xuan.,
Good game need to add a search feature so you can play any music still good tho,
"It didn't work when I was swiping the it was telling me to,but, that could be me so I'll give it a couple of stars.",
kinda like beat saber. I love that about it. it also controls very nicely I would recommend it to everyone,
The game is brilliant its got a nice rhythm to it as well and its beat saber vr button moblie 5 stars,
"The game was better before, now I can't beat the easiest level in expert plus (Dont you dare to think ""You have just gone bad"" no, I am cuting the cubs but, yes but you have to cut them perfectly in the middle.",
"It is fantabulously fun also can you please add the song ""full charge""",
The swiping when i swipe its late and u cant slice the cubes as far as u can even in beat saber but beat saber better,
I love this game even tho there are a lot of ads I still think it's fun.👍😁,
Its good but ads are annoying and i encounter a bug and the swipe is slow,
I love it so much I have seen this game in YouTube people playing it and o really wanted to play it so bad then I saw this game I was like woah I am downloading it it's fun to play since it's quarantine,
Game wont let me play after I clicked songs tried uninstalling then reinstalling removed other apps trash dont install,
I love this game so much but we need to get more coins after we play a.... song?? I don't know what to call it🙂🤭😂,
SO MUCH GOOD SONGS but there is to much ads if you can fix that.,
The game is awesome i enjoyed playing it for me it has no bugs for now anyway good job to the dev,
"Just use an adblocker and this game is fine, def the best beat saber ripoff ive found on mobile.",
I wish I could of gve it a 0..when I went into the game it just get dark and stops working anyone with the same problem?,
This game is great 😄😄😄😄😃😃😃😀😀😀😊😊😊:My brother wrote this first part and i was like i guess ill try it and to add to his review it is great i love the mechanics and just the genuine fun it brings me.,
games awesome but can you add like a flip screen so we can play side ways plz.,
This is the best game but pls add custom songs where you can make your own music and post it online,
This game is so bad i swear it lags alot and it sucks you might just want to get a vr headset its olny $399 or $299,
Great might have a few ads here in there but will recomen time killer,
"Everytime I swipe, the things pop up so I can't see where to swipe on the next one",
I really like the app but sometimes it just like oh no ad and i need energy and im like no device works,
"I paid to remove ads and I still get them, and they keep asking me to rate it",
"Laggy, glitchy, also a rip off of beat saber but it's really low quality",
The music portion of the game works butit glitches everytime I try to play it,
HEY i want a challenge add new game JSAB and actually make i hard plz. I'd really enjoy that ;),
Very fun doesn't just get old after a while it is also pretty challengeing,
Has to meany ads and very gliche it gets stuck and it dose nothing about it.,
good graphics but the app just crashes as soon as I open it up,
It's actually quite enjoyable. There are a lot of ads tho.,
The games music iant even clear not possible to give it a 5 star sorry but pls fix the game music it sucks,
This is a cool game i like the song Unity in hard mode it is super duper fast for me hahahhahahahahah,
Terrible the arrows don't even show up and its way too laggy to even be considered a game,
Absolutely broken with gliches. And you have to hit the blocks when theyre ridiculusly far from you.,
I loved this game! I love those songs! I really loved specially faded! Good job!,
"This game so really really suck and it's lag that's why like this game fix i,'ll give u 5 star fix this the bug",
This is a great game I love all the songs and different colors for your blade,

This is a really great game to play in quarantine and that's what everyone is up to so I give it a five star rating.,
"It keeps crashing. My phone can play Wii games, but not mobile beat saber?",
"Most of the time, the swipes dont even register, 0/10000",
Only thing is that there is bad calibration and I cannot tell when I can hit the blocks,
This is game is clear but you have to add manly songs like feel invinceble or something make sure you step up your game ok,
"Thanks for looking at my review, ive since tested and i will say its alot more challenging and alot more fun 👍 keep it up",
I dont have vr and i've been wanting to play beat saber but beat swiper good to i love the app almost the same thang as i see people playing beat saber amazing app😄😄😄,
I doesn't even load and the cube just goes faster and the music are buggy,
"Its ok,the green light that appears when you hit a box makes be miss like 4 boxes.",
The game is.. not that great firstly it looks bad and secondly its very laggy,
Great game though i think the beat to the songs are a bit slow,
I thought it was gonna be boring at 1st but it has my favorite song rise up by the fat rat I was like. Yes....,
Really good game but fix quality of lights and add more songs,
Some of the notes would just sit there then you just could not hit any of the notes,
The graphics is perfect the songs is adorable this game is so addictive,
Scam of beat saber.....waste of time don't download it.....Edit: developers need to do more work work to the game.,
I like it but the controls need to be a bit better but good game non the less,
The game keeps glitching out what do you use to make this game a potato you really need to fix this game I'm giving this game one star,
This game is good and I enjoy while I playing but it needs to be more like the original one on VR,
It doesn't even register when I swipe my finger across the cubes.,
It had good quality but a lot of ads 5 stars!!,
"There are always ads, u wast more time watching ads than The game it self",
Such an interesting game and I just loved it a lot. I play this game whenever I feel boring or I don't have nothing to do. Such an cool game live this game.,
This is the best game it's just like beat saber and I been playing beat saber for 2 years and beat saber mobile is the best.,
Well my first try to swipe I missed and it stopped working so FIX YOUR BROKEN GAME THAT IS THE SAME THING BUT WORSE THEN BEAT SABER like dang,
Can't even play a single album without it crashing,
It looks real but there is hard mode too and i love it it looks very real,
This game need to be fixed everytime I play the game it has no arrows like dude fix it,
"Great game , really intence , but there is way too many ads",
I hate it when i swipe correctly i misses for no reason and we cant costumise songs?,
It's a good game but it sens is bad and there is lots of ads,
Such nice songs i live how it hard that way it a much more challenging game for me,
It's okay and all but they need to put in a custom songs option,
It's fun but sometimes it's gets a little bit harder! >_<,
Really good a lil slow and has a lot of ads but good,
So fun great time killer and lovely music would like more music than thought,
"First screenshot has ""import custom song"" option but it is missing in game",
K first of all when I missed the swipe there turned literaly nothing I almost kit my iPad for this not recommended,
Cant even play my own song the files wont load i converted my music and its still not there,
Its possessed! I swear! I'm playing it and all of a sudden it has distorted music!!,
You shuold add tilt while cutting the cube and add more new effects in the background,
I give this 1 star its absolutely laggy and I cant even hit the notes without the game crashing,
I love this game but No Full screen Can you fix it It's easy to Full Screen♥️,
The game is great all the adds make the game bad and it lags me out alot,
This is dunb and the worst it is unplayable it keeps crashing,
"This game used to be good, but it stopped working. Fix this, and I'll reinstall.",
Sorry for being rude but the game was awful it glitched out or something I barely could play one song,
It is good compared to beat saber but can the game allow us to play our own music that we downloaded in our phones ?,
fun game👍though it is not equipped with app updates and more songs.,
This game is so fun and it does not change the voice like magic tiles 3,
Dont waste your time on this bro when you get to the songs the swiping doesnt even work,
This game is so more lagging. It was not to use song from mp3.,
It's a very fun game but lots of ads I understand though,
I think it is a good game but there are some minor bugs and it is kinda lazy,
Great game which is totally unplayable because of ads,
"very laggy, didnt get past the tutorial because no notes showed up",
Is good but the giltch and ads is so annoyed if they been fix I will rate it 5 star,
Best beat Saber I've have ever play on phone but can you add more songs or custom song from our file?,
"I Love this have played for 5 minutes and took a vote and I stand rested, At this game rules!!!",
It was great but sometimes it freezes and you miss things,
Good game but they wont add any songs from video games so i 3* it.,
If you had a graphic option to get to 60 frames I'll play it again,
Pretty fun game but has way to many ad breaks,
Trash dosen count my slashes to many ads when I hit it says miss or wrong when I hit right,
I would swipe on time and the wright way but it said I missed it but besides that it's a fun game,
Mua rip off of beat saber but good as beat saber this is a very good game quality graphics is good five stars this is my post,
Very good game enjoy slot would recommend and quite challenging,
Pretty fun ngl but u can't type in a song yoy want to ply u gotta chose but the songs arn't bad to ply,
I like this game but reason i give 4 stars its becuse when i swip bloks that dont have back music in songs,
I rate this a four because when I'm on the last cube i Hit the cube the right way and it says I didn't hit it,
Its so fun frist is kinda hard but at tje end its so cool and fun go try it,
DONT INSTALL doesn't work that well can't swipe on some of them,
I like the game but.. it whoudent read when I'd swipe the screen.,
Bad game I can't even touch the cubes and I fail all the time again bad game,
The game is good but you can't find some songs pls fix this,
This is like AMAZING! Though there is a little bit of glitching but I luv it! -w-,
"very good. sometimes lags a little, but its amazing. i love it :)",
This is all I will say every single dang time I try to get on it crashes on me soon yea,
I give it 1 star because it doesent work when i open the app and im in it for 5 seconds it kicks me out the app,
"This is 100 percent better than what I expected. I play Beat Saber in vr, but right now I cant use my headset and looked this up as a joke, and now I love this game.",
It's a good game. It's just that it's buggy. It damages your phone so badly.,
I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS. I FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BUT THEN I END UP LOSING THE GAME IN JUST SECONDS.,
I give it 5 be cose the song and music u shud add a list so we can pick a song,
It's slow and it didn't work for I had to reset alot,
Only thing that would make it better is if you add the ability to play your own songs,
It's a pretty fun and very challenging game if you get the hang of it,
"Fun for... 10 mins. I beat a Expert+ first try, so I'm not to impressed. Prefer Beat Saber",
i would not install this app because it crashes way to much like every minute so DO NOT INSTALL THIS.AND WAY TO GLITCHY,
This game always kickes me out and stresses me out it even says I did not cut the block when I cut it,
It is fun and cool but one problem it had to many glitches so only three stars sorry 😞,
"Good but the (pretend that this is number/or score)+ is covering the screen,when you have ios you can play peacefully😀😀",
"Custom songs are easy, why? Also can you add map making tools so I can make my own map",
Y E S this has to be one of the best mobile games. Plz add more songs!!,
Each time I go through the red it sometimes does not take it as a hit Its always lagging too,
Lags Fps not following the speed beat is completely off don't swipe sometimes,
Controls are awful and so much glitches like I couldn't hit the boxes,
I like this game and i give it a 5 STAR RATING.All the songs are just great!,
"Very laggy, slow and low quality.",
This is an cool game and i think one of my best games i mean i just started and i really liked it best game ever and i just started so i dont have much to say so yeah,
I like this game but I can't see the beat because of the score on the screen,
It's a good game don't get me wrong but didn't it have something to add YOUR OWN songs? I never found it ಠ﹏ಠ,
This game is amazing it has helped alot with my coordination but it's better than my dad coming back with the milk! (He didn't),
It very good to wake you up and very good finger training,
"1 star only, I Love your Game but it's not functioning properly 🥺 I'm using Oppo A31, is there any Solution to fix the Problem?",
It's really fun the graphics is awesome the songs besutiful,
I'm always laging because some of the arrows keep spawning inside where you have slash,
I can't even play the application keeps force closing on my Samsung s9,
Horrible app very laggy and I am swiping and it is not registering...😣😣😣,
Its more like beat saber but in mobile looks like a better way that is really lets me up to the game sales,
This is good but something wrong the game is lagging and cannot get any thing in my phone,
Fun game if there were no ads and your swipes always registered...,
This game is very laggy and bearly ever works. Sometimes I swipe and it says I miss!?,
Could you try to add more then at least 10 frames,
Keeps crashing and closing it self down fix this other wise my rating wont change,
This game is good but you should stop spamming ads add a tutorial wait this game ia dead why am i commenting on it oh well,
"I like it very much, because it's relaxing and fun at the same time.",
Too many adds imput is bad and no hard song and you can play side ways,
Couldnt even play it because it continually froze.,
to many adds do you really need this much adds? I will redownload if adds are removed,
Great game exept the minute long unskipable ads.,
"Best game ever, if arrows disappear I suggest lowering the grafics XD",
this game sucks it would just crash every time I tried opening the game,
Great game but I want more songs (especially anime opening),
Very hard but really really fun and good songs,
The only thing that would ale thos game better is if you could play your own songs,
You can't even play it ether crashes or it doesn't let you hit the notes,
Good and the graphics seem a little off,
I love how the notes lag closer and closer and disappear before they pass the line.,
This game keeps crashing not even uninstalling and re installing it worls 😡😡😡,
It's just the tutorial and. Every thing is black with those nasty fingers,
Every time I go up and down or sideways it don't even hit the block,
I really love the songs and those songs were all of my favorite songs ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,
Its so cool! But I can't sometimes I swipe it it didn't swipe.....,
It is good but it is way to laggy when there is a lot of blocks,
It was horrible it was not working even thow i hit them i was unhappy 😠😡😡😡😡 i wold have given it no stars if it was possible,
The game Is awesome a lil to much ads and they should add some new songs,
It just keeps crashing oh i forgot to tell that it works the next day but why🤔,
Too much lag and the beats are off.,
I Love It and please put more songs and can you put Captain Sparklez songs Please,
Doesn't work on my phone keeps kicking me out every time I open the app,
It's just a total laggy mess while completely knocking off of beat saber,
I'm thinking can you add rebirth but this is a good good game I love it jest can you add rebirth plz,
it is all black so can you please fix this because I don't have a vr and can't play beat saber so please fix this for me btw UWU 5 ☆!!!!!!!,
First this app was not working now it's working and one of the biggest updates ever I love this app! 🎉,
"""a unique mobile rhythm game"".. looks very much like beat saber to me.... edit: i never said i liked the game ;-;",
You know great game has little bugs but I enjoyed your game it's really fun,
Really Fun And The Graphics/ Audio Are Awesome!,
So good and fun and not to many ads it my new favorite game on my phone,
Too many ads and it's choppy/laggy and there's no portrait mode,
"Thank you devs,, Everytime i just wanted to play beat saber,,,, But i couldn’t😓.But because of you guys now i can play it😀😀,,,,,,THANK YOU verry much😀",
Well there is to many adds and you need a lot of skill it hard and to many adds,
It was really fun!!! Since I don't have the VR one.,
It would not show anything on the app and I could not do anything. Worst beat saber rip off ever,
This game is the best no ads one problum it it lag a little please make it,
Game broken and needa some fix cuzz when it started i cant do anything and wont let me hit,
This game is bad becuse it not work for me,
Awesome but please add miley cyrus song wrecking ball!,
This game is perfectly fine?,
The tiles are so confusing bro,
Very good game i want to say oh so maybe some my hands older and some you know like swords,
I love it it's amazing I can't play beat sabers so this makes me feel better keep the good work up,
I love the game but can ya add custom your self a match would be fun 🦊😶,
It wasn't good it was delayed and alot of ads,
Love how the difficulty goes from being too easy to being impossible and no in-between,
Ang bagal mag download It's too slow and it's completed right and its restart again😠😠😠😡😡😡,
It is very simular to beat saber but you swipe instead.,
Its pretty laggy and i wish it had more pop hits/ more songs,
You can't really see the blocks and I can't even use my two fingers for this,
I would live it if they added a custom level feature!,
I do not like this game it glitchies alot i give it a 2 just beacuse it looks cool,
Beat swiper is a great a similar to the game it self beat saber on TV but beat swiper is on mobile,
Add community work and it would sync with the music!,
It an amazing fun app buttt I beat the game in two days you guys should bring in new songs,
Good game but only ad 30 second when i restart beat swiper,
"Can I play this game on a Vr helmet. Please answer if I this game is compatible with a Vr headset, then I'll change the review to 5 stars :D",
it's really laggy and the game has way to many ads,
I love it but can we play our own song if yes then where I can play my own song,
"It doesn't let me SWIPE OR ANYTHING, I CAN'T EVEN WATCH ADS FOR 100 COINS....WHAT THE F***",
There's too much ads and there non-skippable,
"Visual bugs, almost whole screen is full of green",
To many ads but I like the music ●♡●,

Great game ive never seen a game like this i saw it from rocket league so i wanted to try it out,
Amazing I really recommend this app I have had no issues and me and my brother both enjoy it,
"When I tried it, I just sat there waiting. I sat there for a minute and nothing was happening",
It is just like beat saber and it is awesome Why I like the game is because it brings out my best intrest a lot,
It is a little lag and the red colour could not be swipe,

It's good i give it 5 stars but my father deleted it and i need to restart again are you kidding me well it's good but i need to do it again it's going to be forever to get the believer song and the others,
Its dum and in the instructions it said nothing about going across it is lagging and annoying,
"Obvious replica to beat saber, but literally the lowest point of comparability.",
Trash wouldnt swipe and very low quality,
This game sucks because there's to many ads and it looks like beat saber👎👎😠😠,
"Is a great experience, somethings can be improved but still being pretty cool",
its so dumb it keeps being a black screen everytime i go in the game,
"My absolute favorite game. What? This is a shameless copy of a incredible good game which isn't even any good? Oh ok. (Seriously tho, screw you guys)",
When isae the pictures i thought wr can use our own music but i dont know how to get it. Please fix it.,
So cool and have a little hard to win XD but still cool like real beat saber Hope overyone play this game,
It was giching in and out and i couldnt hear the songs,
The game is hard to play and when you try and play it doesn't work,
Really good quality and provides a great challenge,
It's pretty good and I like the fact that there is a lot of songs to choose of,
Love The Game Way More Levels Than Before Still Thi nk A Shop Would Be Great But Still Amazing,
This is very good app for my fevered song of attack on tition rap thank you so much 😚😚😚😚😚,
Mine always lagging and always watch ads so I detil the game off my phone,
I enjoyed the game... final musics are impressive.,
Very glithey sound the sound are very bad quality I hate this game,
i bet it was good but for me on chromebook it was a black screen is this normal?,
I luv it its music but i got bored and inanstaled it but its super fun,
Its fun but when i slash the beats its late but its fun to play,
"Is good but....the only thing is about the expert.When ever I try it, it said error and I don't know how to do that",
It's really laggy and i cant get past the first song because of it,
I hope you could make the graphics a little bit like the one in vr,
Highly inaccurate touch calibration in this game.,
its so good but it has a lot of ads,
Its good but when I try it it is laggy and the cubes dont work,
"I mean, it's good, but it's laggy and it gets annoying",
Barely any songs and just not a good game to have on mobile,
"THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!! THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME EVER GOOD THING I FOUND THIS ON PLAY STORE THANKS FOR MAKING IT,IT IS SOOO COOL!!! 😄😄😄😄",
The game so bad it's just well it's not really bad I really like it to you 4 well because well I like it I like it a lot like a lot a lot for I I really give a 4,

This game is cheap and a ripoff of beat saber beat saber is much more better than this garbage,

"So bad it didnt even keep up with my taps, just get piano tiles guys",
I like it but it has to many ads,
Graphic feeling and everything is terrible,
Used to work but randomly stopped working,
"exactly like beat saber, but so many ads its obnoxious",
"Every time I Do what it says on the blocks,it doesn't work at all",
I like the swipe but 1. Pls remove ads Pls 2. I need more song,
Wonderful Games with beautiful songs I really enjoy it,
Paid $5 and there is still ads...pls fix,
Relaxing fun not that hard and different CV modes,
Im always in rage when i play this but somehow i cant stop playing and thats a cool game,
It's hard bc everytime I swipe it's not working,
Hard to play It's very laggy and many ads,
"I really like it, very challenging to play...",
It says offline but it's not. Don't put that in the description if your not gonna make it offline.,
Theres a bug were it dosnt show which driction to swipe and its laggy,
Ok now I am demanding it i DEMAND YOU TO FIX THIS GAME BECAUSE YOU CANT JUAT MAKE A RIP OFF OF BEAT SABER AND IF YOU MESS UP A WHOLE BUNCH AND THE BLOCKS STAY THERE AND TOO MUCH ADDS FIX THIS NOW! I WOULD GIVE THIS 0 STARS.,
Terrible controls very jumpy will switch randomly,
I played all of the songs in beat swiper so I want their to be more songs to play😁😁😁,
It's so good but we cannot choose our own songs,
"Extraordinary mini game,excitment experience is breathtaking👏👏👏",
Can you add a feature to add Downloaded songs? I really wanna do Billie Eilish's Bad Guy.,
It needs a little more polish but overall is a great game,
Thanks for giving us the phone version of beat saber and now I don't need a VR screen,
U are saying that to many ads are coming. Off ur mobile data. So ads will not come,
"Keeps crashing, can't even play",
Ya know I really like this game and it is challenging and fun at the same time😁,
If I could put zero I would because this game is so bad when you try to cut one it doesn't even work like what type of stupid game is this I'm not trying to be rude but it's so bad 😡😡🤬,

This is a good app but whenever i slash anything there are some numbers for that reason i cant see properly,
Really good and fun also love the music,
Really fun challenging plus not to many adds,
Uh... why are those TikTok songs only available in this game? This can't be good.,
"I was at 18,000 and a commercial made me stop so that is why I give this game 1 star",
Wonderful game but the beat does not go with song,
"It is the best game, I have ever experiences. I loved it please play it😀😀😀😍😍😍",
Well its good but i have to reinstall it cause it crashes,
It would be 0 because it lagging for no reason because I have strong internet please make no smoothness and not laggy,
It does not capture the feeling of beat saber!,
It's not bad but like need to add more songs,

Slow load in between each song.,
Fun but ads after every stage,
It's so great it's almost just like this same beat swiper but it's awesome,
I'm not able to play its just shows me the loading screen,
I love this game so much i have so much coins and im gonna play the real beat saber soon and just started today,
I love that I can have this game on my phone. But this game really doesn't please me because it makes me die.,
Every time i swipe two cubes it says i miss that was very annoying,
"Bad graphics, but good gameplay",

"I love this game so much, MAY NOT BE VR but still amazing",
Like beat saber but wish had more types of music like beat saber,
Full of unskipable ads,
TERRIBLE GAME Can never hit notes and if you die it doesnt matter,
Won't swipe over half the time I swipe.,
Very good. Easy to understand!,
It literally won't read my swipes most of the time,
I am giving 4 stars cuase i want there to have sabers and you need to swipe with the saber to hit the cube,
just way too many ads ☹👎,
"it's lagging :3, i was expecting that it would be great but sadly it's not",

"It's a good game, but it isnt nice qhe I'm a pro of the game and haven't got my beloved expert+ yet :(",
Expert + is slow and there r so many gltiches,
This is the best game ever! But i cant slice the thing sonetimes cus there is not enough room its still Good tho,
Terrible sometimes it won't let me cut any one of them,
It has a lot of music it's in virtual reality and now it's on mobile and I'm like wow,

"Maybe Some new songs like Vocaloid songs! I don't know if you know what Vocaloid is, but lets say Hatsune Miku For example. Japanese virtual singer, theres many other Vocaloids like Miku but shes main. It would be so cool if you added Vocaloid songs. Edit: My favourite song is Rolling Girl, by wowaka from Project diva. RIP to wowaka :< he passed away, made the best Vocaloid songs ever!",
Its so hard but its cool at the same time,
Great graphics awesome music love it,

Best game ever Love it <3 But u should make it on landscape mode too,
Like beat saber but mobile AMAZING!,
The boxes are not showing so dissapointing,

It's an awesome game! It feels like i am playing beat saber! 💓,
The game is little bit hard but it is a good game,
I b love watching people play beat saber so i like playing it but on a phone,
I like it! It's like beat saber which is from vr head set!,
Awesome!it had a lot of my fav songs!,
It's a great game but there are so many adds. :),
I would give this game a 0 because when I go on it I get kicked off the game like I just want to do a fkn song like beliver,
The best but I can't play my own music on it,
I HATED IT IT DOESN'T EVEN GO TO THE GREEN LINE AND PLUS IF YOU MISS ONE NO OTHER ONES COME!!!,
It good but I wish there were more songs,
Is not really but I like it I like it so much gamer has that in his will but I like that game as well 💕,
I feel like I'm actually in vr this game is so cool that's why I give it 5 stars I would give it 100 if I could,
"Beat saber, just spend 399 dollars to get a better experience",
I have done a lot of the songs and there super good,
It has all my favorite songs it's pretty good,
It's good but sometimes I can't see the way to swipe,
Luv the game lotta ads but i just turn off wifi :P,
Pretty much just like the beeat sabaer on vr but you has to le swipe Good amaze ing,
I LOVE IT this game is for those who cant afford vr and beatsaber,
THIS GAME IS AWESOME I HOPE THIS GAME HAVE ALL MUSIC I LIKE THIS GAME FOREVER!! BUT IM STILL BAD AT THIS GAME 😂😂😂😂 I TRY MY BEST,
I like it so much becouse it feels like i am playing beat saber i like it soo much,
I CANT PLAY WHY EVERY TIME I CLICK PLAY THE SCREEN IS BLACK OR I GO OUT THE APP😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,
I like it it is very hard and good and it is fun,
Very frequent crashes,
Gotta admit it's fun and exciting!!,
Good game just a copy of my favorite vr game and a copy of beat slasher but a good game XD,
It's just like beat saber I love it!,
Every time I click a song it closes the game,
I like UNITY because it is my fav (favorite) song and I like the BEAT SABER type. ps I'm Nathaniel,
play this if all u wanna do is watching ads,
well this game is really good the back ground hurts me eyes tho...but it's ok,
Every time I hit a beat saber there's green stuff in the back it's hurts my eyes and messes me up,
I love this game is a little hard but i got the hang of it,
Its very nice I wanted tk play beat saber on mobile this is the perfect app,
This app sucks. You can't get into it even after you get it.,
I love this game its so fun Please make part two,
The levels fun and good,
"Cool, but make it less glitchy.Thanks",
Can't even play just crashes,
Trash doesn't even show the arrows,
I have a question is it vr compatible Btw it came up with my fav song when i loaded it up :3,
It is awesome it is just like real beat saber but on tablet,
It was exactly like the VR game Beat Saber can't tell them apart,
It's hard but so much fun,
The game won't load but I'm sure I'll love it once I play it😊,
its very easy to play,
One of the best 2020 games you can play in the world,
I love this game just needs more songs,
Sometimes I keep hitting does but it Dodge this game absolutely sucks,
This game is just bad I'd you are so desperate just buy beat saber and a Oculus quest or a rift s and if you can't get beat saber play it in vr chat (it is a free vr/non vr game),
I'm in love with this game. But i kindly request you to add the Rasputin song.,
Great game to play if you just wanna relax,
This is reminds me of beat saber the game is so fun,
If you missed in the tutorial the game just stopped,
Just like beat saber but pls add a lot of songs,
It's just like beat saber but phone version,

"Fun, looks just like best saber",
You need faster cubes like so fast that it can't stop people from moving so slow,
Very fun just like it is on vr very addictive,
The greatest game and the hardest game and the goodest game in the whole universe,
In have been wanting to play beatbsaber on vr but once i found out that its an app i emediatly downloaded it,

Bit of fun while I'm not playing proper beat saber,
"It is pretty good, except for sometimes it won't respond to my touch",
It's good but it's also very laggy,
the game is great keep the good work,
Wonderful game I absolutely love it.,
I like the beat swiper the name must change to Beat saber because the name is beat saber thanks for my review,
This game is smooth moving and I just like it,
