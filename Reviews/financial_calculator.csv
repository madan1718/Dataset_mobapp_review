Review Text,Category
"I have used this app for two years and love it. It has only one glitch that I have encountered. When you open the regular calculator inside the app, you have to force stop to get back to the rest of the optional calculators. Not a big deal but should have a ""back"" button. Revised 5/6/2020 After posting my review, I was contacted by the app Creator and we worked through a couple of things on my phone. Found an easy correction for my issue. Works great. Super customer service!",
"I've used several financial calculator apps, but this app is by far the greatest of them all. It has the soft confortable theme, easy to use, the term and language it uses is easy to understand. Even the ads is carefully design so that it doesn""t affect the basic navigation within the app. This is the mother of all calculators!",
Stunned by a calculator app. Great work with the subcategories and calculators. But I would like to point one very integral thing that's often ignored and is ignored in this app too. It's the UI. The app is below par visually. It doesn't look that good. Maybe the people who need the sub calculators will have to ignore the overcluttered UI anyhow. But the first thing the average user needs is a simpler and minimalistic UI. A great UI can make the app the best in the business. Fix it.,
"It has a bug where the inflation rate is off by one zero causing your income to be grossly incorrect, I.e. a ""4"" for inflation in the retirement income calculator is really 0.4, so you have to enter 40 to get an accurate 4% figure. Sucks that I counted on this app for my retirement planning and found out later that it had this bug.",
Love the app and use it for work and school. One issue I have is on the stock expected return calculator. It does not give the correct standard deviation. Only correct expected return. Can you please fix this? An extra feature that would be helpful is a calculator to sum up market return and stock return to find the beta. Thanks.,
"Just downloaded it, and it works fine. However, I noticed that with the TMV Calculator, the beginning mode isn't being calculated.",
"Very impressive, far more than I expected. Amazing collection of apps within one app. Update: I stand corrected New Zealand is there if one does a search. Thank you for the advice. No hesitation in recommending, I know of no better calculator than this application. It's simply the best.",
"The TVM function does not work. I can use the TVM function on the TI-84 Plus as well as a BA-2 Plus, and do manual calculations with repeatable matching results. This calculator does not come close. I haven't tried any other functions, because I only installed for financial purposes.",
High ranked by 5M users so i installed. My phone instantly went crazy and is giving me options on what program to choose to open apps or return to the home screen. Uninstalled PRONTO. Didn't even get to open the calculator once!!!!! I'll just use my financial calculator for it's intended purpose instead of making my phone do more than it obviously can.,
The calculator is good but if you want to calculate based on number of days there is no choice. Only choice given his years or months. They should add days elapsed. That's what is usually used in precise calculations. I don't know how they could ignore or missed it,
"This app is so interesting and and gets you thinking while giving you ideas & even goals you can set for savings & reducing debt/CC balances. They have many calculator categories to choose from: General, Finance & Investment, Loan & Mortgage, Business Accounting and more. Even the 72 and 78 Rule. Check it out, and use it!",
"Overall good app but I think there is an issue with the home affordability calculator. When you enter a lower debt to income ratio, it actually lowers the affordability amount which doesn't make sense.",
"This is a fantastic financial calculator! I particularly like the TVM, the time value of money calculator. It enables me to figure out for example what $100 invested today at 10% interest (the long-term average return on the stock market) would be worth 30 years from now. (The answer is $1983.74!!!) If that doesn't motivate you to contribute more to your IRA I don't know what will!!! It's also great for calculating payments, interest, etc. for home loans, car loans and all things financial.",
"I use this app for loan calculations, retirement/investment return projections, etc. It does exactly what I need it to. I do wish they would create a similar desktop version. That would be really helpful.",
"It is 100% perfect for I read one of the reviews that TVM features does not function but it really does, despite the fact that my mi phone does not open many apps. It will really save us time. Thank you for this great stride",
"I love this app, so helpful when planning. The only thing I would like to see added is in the bi-weekly payments loan calculator. I would like to see an option to pay additional funds bi-weekly. I like to pay my minimum monthly payment every time I get paid if I have to take out a loan.",
"Does everything I've asked it to so. It's great to have to figure interest and how to save on it I'd you make early or additional payments. Works for just about everything from car, credit, 401's, IRA's, mortgages etc.",
"It's rare when you come across this kinda quality applications. Non invasive, very easy to use and just does whatever it is intended to do. What an amazing piece of application. I am very grateful to the developer for providing such a nice financial all in one calculator. It's an important app for me.",
"This is really great app that I have using for various conversion calculations, as a Calibration technician it definitely comes in handy for fast as easy information. Would it be possible to add printer capabilities to this app. Thx",
"I have used this app several years now. I have always been impressed with it's capabilities. From simple to more complex financial calculations, it has done the job including me to output the results.",
It is a good app. But mostly apt for USA. For Indian users some of calculators are good to work with. But rest are/may not be worthy. But it helps to know and calculate basic needs. Some process of calculation are different in the USA and India. Otherwise thumbs up. Keep it up. I use seldomly hence can't tell about all features.,
Exactly what I was looking for. Every other app makes you type in how many years your interest will compound. This calculator allows you to type in months. This is the best compound interest calculator app I have found and I have tested many.,
"This is such a app on its face, but has so much room for complexity that it can help with almost any question. As a financial adviser I use this app all the time for quick calculations. Simple for anybody who knows at least a little about how financial calculations work",
Lots of variety. No ads I have noticed. So far does everything I need it to do when paired with a debt payoff app. If anything changes I'll change my review.,
"Excellent app. It would be nice if the Calculator keeps track of historical entries, if at least a brief history to see past calculations.",
"One of the finest financial calculator app. Using it for several years, easy UI and very very convenient to use. More than 5 stars to the team.",
Extremely useful for so many different kind of financial calculations. Also fun to see potential profits and what if scenarios. Especially the stock calculations. Free and non-intrusive ads that help users support the developers.,
The most comprehensive set of calculators in one app; easy to use. Excellent business and financial calculators which are difficult to find anywhere else.,
"So far, so good The only financial calculator you'll ever need. Pensions, investments, loans, Fibonacci... You name it. No more looking for the information online. Could give some graphs to visualize the tables it creates, would be better.",
"Pretty great. 4.5 stars A couple of the calculates could use a better explanation as to what they are for and what the inputs are, but overall it is the shiz Add some investment property calculators please",
"Great for financial and miscellaneous calculation. This app is really awesome.  Please add option for calculation of loan on credit card, as in credit card loan they charge  GST(18%) every month on payble interest.",
I love all the different calculators. They are extremely useful. I also love that you can hide the ones you don't use and then looking backup if you rarely need them,
Excellent financial calculator!! I use this regularly for TVM calculations as well as 401K planning. Very easy to use and has a huge amount of handy calculators built in. Devs respond to emails almost instantaneously as well.,
"I am carrying forward to my new phone using it since last few years, a perfect app for loans, interest, repayment calculations. Wish i could give more stars. What are the other apps the developer has in the store must look at them also üëç",
it was a great app until the ads arrived. they are in an annoying area and are annoying. no good in my opinion. deleting and going to find another one.,
I have used this for years now. It is handy and easy to use. If you are dealing with any finances this is the go to app to have!,
"Excellent Financial Calculator- so far I have ever seen or used. Accurate Result, Diversified Fields, Most Possible Calculation and Analysis options, User friendly UI. Whenever I have change my phone or have to give reset, everytime I install this app first. Love it very much (being a Banker). One Expectation from developer: Please add Grace Period Option (Customized/deffered EMI Start date) in loan Calculator. I also use your exoense manager. Thanks to the developer.",
"The Best Calculator I have ever used, It is outstanding, All critical financial calculations were possible and in one application. It helps me at every step along the way of finance and also other. Thanks to the developer for creating this app.",
"The app isn't bad, but it doesn't have a comma to separate the different values (thousand, million, billion). Very irritating when dealing with big numbers.",
"Great, quick, and accurate information. Use this calculator everyday if not more. I have all of my employees, mentees, and colleagues download as well. Highly recommend. Free, Add free, not glitches!",
I wish the basic calculator within the app was a little better. I have to close the app and launch my phone's default calculator to perform long stings of basic arithmetic.,
One of the best calculator bundle apps you will find. Has so many cool features and different options for calculations. This is a must have for anyone who knows how to do math.,
"It truly is a wonderful app. Has literally everything, well designed. You can even do a in app search for desired calculator. thanks a lot to the creators.",
Good calculator. However what has happened to the currency converter graph?? Seems to have dissapeared. Can't find a setting to turn it off or on.,
"Very good app. Been using it for a few years. But, I miss an XIRR calculator. This will help to calculate investment returns. Why not add it?",
"Awesome, don't understand why this app is free and/or without ads. There are calculators that explain you how to use financial ratios even. Whatever i used so far is very user friendly and without bugs.",
The Xirr calculator isn't working the app goes blank once i click on it. It only worked the first time and then it just glitches out/freezes on every opening.,
This app is extremely useful and has literally everything you need to calculate. Saved me the time for downloading different apps for calculating different things.,
I use this app on a regular basis. Never thought it would be so helpful. Never has any glitches or anything. No ads. Great service for almost 2 years now.,
"This is truly the best and most complete financial calculator you can find ! It has totally replaced my HPBIIb and the big advantage is that it is always with me, on my phone ! Great job !!!",
"Great app, Sugested my students to keep this app in their mobile permanently. One more thing I wanted in this app is cross multiplication to calculate commercial things and insurance premiums calculation.",

This is the best app for any students in finance.Hence its saves both time and money calculating huge trail and error for IRR and so forth. Thanks to the developersüòä,
"I'd prefer if i could pay for this app so that it would stop showing me ads already. Other than that 10/10 app, had all the main calculators you would want/need.",
"The ease of the financial calculator is good. However, the add or subtract working days do not work on the financial calculator.",
Great accurate and convenient app. Simple intersest amortization and grace period option should be added.,
"Finance students. Get this app. Makes life easier. My universities' store offers a BA-II Plus financial calculator, but why get that confusing thing when you have this?",
"This is one best financial calculators there is. It's simple to use, clear graphics. I Love it!!! Thank you.",
Very user-friendly & powerful tool for Financial Planning. I seldom write reviews but this is one which I won't be doing justice if I don't give it a 5* rating! It'll also be great if you can add-on the Retirement Savings Calculator for iOS. Thx!,
LOVE IT ... wish it would plot optimal payoff point (yet to see this on any software other than actuarial) ... for novice users I would suggest a 15 vs 30 year payoff EXPLAINING that the 30 is SAFER as you're committing to a smaller payment (safer if you lose a job etc. Its easier to come up with the lesser payment) and actual ADDITIONAL payment which is optional ADJUSTED FOR DIFFERENCE IN 15 YR VS 30 YR RATES ...,
Most underrated App. One of the best Finance App have seen. The App can be default calculator in each and every mobile. All the very best for the developers.,
"Not just the best app of its kind, but the support is by far superior. Timely, quick, patient and excellent.",
Easy to understand and use. Gives you what you need to know fast... Change any of the numbers and recalculate just as fast. It's a keeper!,
"I'm actually rather mad, but I'm not sure who's to blame. Your app bypassed my update settings. I have it set to not auto update and only on WiFi. But your app still updated on its own",

"This is a wonderful app I've contributed to a set of requirements that the developer implemented which was really awesome, that was a few years ago now still love the app.",

"You have to watch short ads that you can skip in a few seconds. Annoying 
addition from the last time I had this app. 5 stars without it. Lots of 
different calculators available. I love the paycheck calculator, be you can 
figure what your pay will be after taxes and even adjust parameters. I like 
to see the table of the calcs for the year when I get a raise from not 
having to pay into social security after reaching 115k ish for the year. 
Also, it's fun to run numbers to see how you can make with taste of return 
on this economy. Especially this thumping Trump economy.",
Thank for fast reply.. My problem solve when i install another keyboard for my samsung note 5.,
The auto loan calculation is incorrect for the monthly repayment. It seems that formula is N-1. Please fix it. Wrong calculation may cause the confusion for user.,

"A complete set of tools bundled into one app, amazing!",
"I love everything about this app. I use it for work all the time. I do have 
one recommendation, is it possible to include a whole life insurance rate 
of return calculator? Is it possible to add a mortgage calculator that 
calculates payoffs by doing biweekly payments?",
Very useful App. Ads are there but they do not disturb. Great one !!,
A complete calculators for finance. Very useful esp. for calculating bonds price,
"Easy to use, convenient, and has an intuitive interface. Exactly what I 
needed. Thanks!",
This app is very important in the life ..,

"It will wrongly calculate the Compound intrest.... For example i add 1000‚Çπ 
per month for 1 year period. And assume 8% annual intrest. Then actual 
monthly intrest is 6.67‚Çπ but app display 6.43‚Çπ.... So whole calculation was 
wrong from step 1st",

The TVM calculator needs ability to compound for periods longer than annually. I want to compound once every 4 years.,

"I love this app! I only wish the compound interest calculator would let you enter years instead of months (or give you the option). I'm always trying to figure out the number of months on a seperate calculator before I can run a calculation. Otherwise, everything else is great and the app keeps me on track of my goal of retiring at 53 years old . . . or uhhh 180 months from now (you get the point).",
"Good app. But after the last update, the currency section doesn't work anymore. Kindly kill the bug",
It's a comprehensive and it's all-in-one app. Simply it's great and you can use it for free if you don't want to buy the pro,
Best financial calculator app out there! I especially like the widget: I have a full size calculator right on my home screen and can instantly access financial tools.,
Brother you have did a fantastic job. But I would like to draw your attention towards compound interest calculater. When the report is generated it is showing interest but I think return word is more appropriate. God bless you,
Has everything I needed and more! Very light and non intrusive. I used this to get the best price on a car since I had all the numbers at my fingertips.,
I LOVE this app!!!  There is a calculator for just about everything! My only complaint is that the developer removed the % button in the regular calculator.,
Way to many with NO ads out there that do more,
TVM calculator show compounding option wrong when select annual,
I realised how long it took the developer to creat this amazing app. I wish if I had this when I was doing my Finance at uni,

"Overall - a good app, but not all the phones have a big device storage, so some users would prefer to move this app to an SD card. It would be nice to remain there when the updates are installed, like other apps. Could you please look into this and fix it? Thank you.",
"It was earlier before 2 updates more simple and useful  Tax and discounts calculator showed full information, now doesn't show exact tax amount....",
"I'm a Financial Planner. When I'm having coffee with clients or casually talking to prospects, this calculator has allowed me to provide preliminary answers to their questions. It's excellent. Requests: Canada-specific calculations, like RRSP limits, CESG grants within RESPs, etc.",
"Well I said I loved it before the new updated version. I hated the new.  I uninstalled and now reinstalling hoping for the last version to be put back on. If not, I'll be re-uninstalling this app!",
Great calculator! Has everything I need.,
Everything you need in a single app.,
Best app!,
Best calculator ever,
Nice app,

Please add BMI calculator,
"Used this app to calculate compound interest for the money that I lent. Blindly I trusted this app calculated interest and I lost around Rs.2000 due to wrong calculation by this app. Unless you rectify the problem, it's useless to calculate compound interest.   You can check your self: Enter Principal Amount 100,000, Period 1 month and annual interest rate 12% and select compounding annually. For this simple calculation interest for one month is 1000. But your app showing 948.88  If you select compounding as ""No compound"" then it's calculating interest as 1000. But it should be same 1000 per one month even we compounding annually.",
I wanted a financial calculator that could tell me the percent interest I need. This thing can't do that.,
I'm a financial advisor and this app has helped me a lot in advising my clients on their investments and security.,
I  am accountant so I know how to do these calculations but this makes it so much faster & was the easier of and complete app of the others,
Good useful ap. Unfortunately I cannot seem to get the retirement income analysis how long will my money last to show the amortization table. Can you help,
"So why the ""meh""? Frustration that I still have to look for yet another calc app (which will be ad-filled, no doubt) just do to basic calculations with M+, MR, MC. You have all these sophisticated calculators.. you can't include one good, basic calculator with memory keys?",
"When it comes to the loan calculator you really should include the option of days besides the number of years and months. It's helpful regarding more short term loans, for example.",
The retirement calculators are bad.  They don't index retirement income to inflation.,
"This App is very helpful for calculating emi, compound bank interest, loan ....it will give you a clear idea before any investment or expenditure",
It's simple & does a lot of things like splitting bill with tips/ prices with tax,
"Handy tool to calculate and compare returns, evaluate offers and loan rates on the fly. Requires user to know  finance basics. But once you are versed, this app is extremely useful in decision making.",
I think it is great.So much you can do with that.Nice work. This is a genuine sponsored review,
"Just a comment. Your amortization schedule has errors in the last row. Principal should equal balance of second last row, and adjust payment accordingly.",
"Hi  can you fix a bug? Im using Android 6.0.1 and the keypad for tvm  does not show decimals-its driving me crazy.  The loan calculators keypad has a decimal though. if you can fix the keypad problem, this app is perfect.",
"Wether I'm shopping and checking discounts, helping the kid with homework, or balancing the checkbook... this app has everything!",
Was a great app before the up date now it's good for nothing .  Why change a good  thing !,
"Holy smokes this is a powerful app! Think bulky TI graphing calculator on steroids that also does gymnastics, equestrian and the 1600m butterfly. Woooooooow!!!",
Great app. Very versatile. Has lots of calculators I need. For a free app it's  exceptional,
Excellent financial calculator but badly needs a UI upgrade,
Amortization table only comes monthly. Yearly or half yearly could've been nice,
Amazing app! Lots of different functionalities for which I was previously using multiple different apps. Love It!,

"I use this app in math class to calculate loans and other things. Yes, me and my teacher are aware that there is a loan calculator. But, specifically when trying to calculate for rates in the TVM solver, this version for Android gets radically different results compared to the IOS version. Plz fix. I have images, I just need a place to send them",
"Very good calculator. Please also add fortnightly compounding. Edit: please add the ability to include tax reductions from savings. Eg, in Greece savings interest is taxed by 15 %, so over time the return of investment can vary significantly from the calculation. Also, interest rates go up and down, it would be nice to be able to factor that in a long term calculation.",
Please also include inflation rate. It would be better if we can get the actual figures along with inflation figures.,
As a financial advisor this app is simple to use and great for quickly crunching numbers. I highly recommend it if you're looking for something simple and easy to use.,
The annual contribution (and thus the monthly contribution) amount calculated is wrong. It shows lower than actually required. You can check the error by using compound interest calculator.,
"Easy to use for just about any type of loan,investment or just simple calculations  for any math problem.",
The calculation result showed wrong anwer. Please fix immidiately. Thank you.,
Absolutely great little financial calculator for most everyday issues you may come across,
I use this for any calculations I need to do from tips to loan amortization.,
"It would be perfect ,if i can change calculator widget to tvm widget .",
This app can do any sort of financial calculation I have ever needed to do.,
"I used this app while buying a car and it kept me from being cheated $20 per month. $1,200 over the years of that loan. I use something in this app every week, it's my secret advantage.",
"Only thing that would make this better, is graphs.",
"This helped me plenty in my finance calls, time value of money concepts and Wighted average cost of capital. Save me ton of headaches",
"Finally ,  too good app, properly organized answers were there... Gr8",
Overall app is very good bt I have one doubt by using which menu one can calculate return %age in case of SIP investments.,
Has almost everything. Could use a standard deviation calculator,
"love this free financial calculator... it even bests other paid apps that usually sucks! if there's a paid version of this app, would gladly buy it.",
A good selection of easy-to-use financial tools.,
I've been using it for years with different devices.,
This app is all I need for my real estate practice as I'm a broker. Awesone app!,
A bit confusing in time value,
Great efforts done by the team....as i am from the finance background... i kwn the importance of this app.,

"Appreciate you sharing the details of your need for SD card access permission.  Unfortunately, with a Verizon SCH-I545, the highest Android I can upgrade to is 5.0.1.  I'm restricted by Samsung and Google.  Because of that, I can't remove the permission.  I have the capacity to buy a new phone, but I don't like the migration to larger and larger phones instead of smaller and smaller.  The S4 already pushes my comfort level.  I understand the need to provide solutions for people with newer phones.",
"Excellent! Very comprehensive, easy to use and very well written. Kudos to the programmer(s).",
Not the most accurate but brilliant as all you need is included.,
For all financial calculations you can use this app. Thanks devs.,
Excellent for Future Value Calculation..,
By far and large it is the best calculator. But why does it require a permission to access the media file.??,
Very usefull.... üí≤üí≤üí∞,
Very useful,
Currency list excludes several major currencies including NZD.  All currencies should be available.  Edit ability should be as guide within app.,
Until update wanted permission to access my photos and other media! Not happening!,
"fncalculator is a awesome tool, one request though. An update prior to last one introduced a new feature to give incremental amount to Compounding Interest Calculator. But mostly we get increments in percentage and not in amount hence it would make sense to have yearly increment in percentage.",
"Interest can no longer be entered in decimals. Whole numbers only. Ex: can't do 2.5%. It still isn't fixed. The decimal point on the entry keypad is still grayed out on my S5. Found a new keyboard, now app works great! Beware of the Samsung gotchas.",
"Instructions need a short sentence added to explain that a double tap is required to enter a minus sign, not a press-and-hold as might be expected. Also, it might be easier to use if minus signs were not required when using the TVM Calculator to calculate the future sum of a series of monthly amounts.",
This is the best app ever for financial calculations.. can't imagine how easy n comprehensive it is,
"It needs to display the formula used in calculation,  and break even with operating and total leverage.",
I use it everyday in my daily work. Can't go without it. You help me make so much money. Thank you.,
Easy to use. More option to calculate more things. From age to growth.,
I am working in a Bank. It's very useful for me in day to day activities.,
So much faster and easier than breaking out the HP or TI financial calculators! Look under every tab and you are almost sure to find solution to your equation.,
"This is very use full app. But, one more tools added in this like commercial taxes calculator (value added tax,excise duty, etc.). I hope ur  team think about my suggestions. Thanking you.",
No need for full access to cell phone system,
Great app with so many features. My favorite calculator app!,

"The app performs flawlessly with accurate results. However, I would not recommend for young users like myself, as there are a lot of the more complex variables that are pre-filled and cannot be ruled out, making what should be a simple calculation turn out frustratingly wrong. For experienced planners, this is right for you. Would give better ratings if features are tweaked.",
The Calculator is amazing and it gives most of the solutions in one app. Even the guide to use is fantastic. I had earlier faced a problem with the app and the team at Bishinews very promptly helped me to resolve the issue.  I am a professor in finance and I advice my students to use this app and also teach them to use.  All the best to team Bishinews. Continue doing the good work.,
"Must have for any1 trying to understand finance, investment and return on investment. it takes a while to familiarise yourself with some functions tho.üëç",
Works as designed. Has a breadth of features which makes it an indespensible app. Unable to locate auto lease calculator mentioned in description .,
"Has close to every calculator you will ever need in everyday life. Can calculate a car loan, lease before salesman can pitch you. My banker asked for the app. Figure out our retirement plan.  Darn handy this app is.",
This app has everything I was looking for. Must have app for every financial planner. Biggest plus point is that there are no ads or in app purchases.,
"This would be a 5 star pick, except that they recently started playing advertisements with no way to opt out.",
It's very usefull app. Just one suggestion: add payment plan and option for editing irregular payment plan of loan.,
Dev is very quick to respond and even fixed my issue! I use this calculator everyday and it's spot on with the auto calculator too.,
Amazing calculator I use it many times a day. Simplicity and Accurate. Have a new phone and this was one of the first apps I reloaded. Have also downloaded it to tablets and computers. I tell everyone about it too as there are so many choices of different calculators to use.,
"This app is great for anyone in the financial profession. Doesn't do everything that a typical financial calculator would do, but comes close and for the cost of $0 well worth the download.",
"This app has helped me out so much! I took a financial math class that required me to use a certain calculator. I had gave my calculator to my daughter to play with years before I had taken the class. Lo and behold I couldn't find it when I needed it. This app has not only given me the tools to solve problems, but made them easier. I highly recommend this app!",
I use it iPhone and Android. I'm a business major so it's really useful in school work but I also use it personally.,
Love this app but it will be perfect if it also has a home equity line or credit/business line of credit calculator. Then it would be the best!,
"It works perfectly,  especially if u understand what ur doing. Remember,  the output is determined by the input.",
As is you have to copy paste a minus sign from elsewhere. Should be an easy fix.,
"Downloaded this app so I didn't have to get a finance calculator for my personal finance class. It did everything I needed it to. Its is excellently built, and I can see myself using this even when I'm out of school.",
Very useful app. It helped me a lot to compare investment plans for my personal financial planning.,
"Easy to use, allowed me to input fields in percentage or dollars. The only enhancement I can think of is a solve for x deal.",
Use the calculator several times a day. Retirement calculators are great to figure out retirement investment and planning. Must have tool for everyone who cares about finances.,
Its great calculator and didn't take me much time to decide to go for pro version.  Now I don't need to go to professionals. Great and a must tool for success. Thanks,
Amazing app.. all in one small package..as a banker i got every solution regarding interest rate and other info too very easily.,
I hope in the next update will adding other field fo a charge or similar with option for value or percent in interest compound calculator. Anyway this is an excellent apps.,
Best app on phone. Use this thing know at least 7-9 times a day easy,
Can really save you some money one of the best apps ive ever downloaded very useful cant go out of date because you input your information.,
"These calculators don't work at all. How does $20000 become $47000 after 5 years at 3% interest. These is a financial ruin calculator, or a dreamer at best.",
Great app! Easy to use. Recommend to anyone who needs a no fuss financial calculator. Would like to see material design. That would make this 100%,
The fine tuned calculations can help you save a lot of money in repaying loans!,
Please add simple bank interest calculator for Fixed Deposit.,

"Great for quick scenarios, from mortgages to car loans.",
There are so many tools and functionality with this app.  Very accurate and easy to use.,
Great application. The developer was quick to respond to inquiries. Highly recommend.,
"Surprised its free, more than expected!",
"When I type numbers, it doesn't not have a negative sign to type on my keyboard so I cannot calculate many of the figures that I need. Could you please fix this? thank you",
Everything you could possibly need in a calculator all in one place. Nice!,
"Excellent app, has many functions . Highly recommended",
many things in a small app...works fine,
Getting debt free with this app ..helps me understand everything I need to know,
The best all in one! Thank you for making such a great app!,

"Awesome calculator app. Thanks for the paycheck calculator, but you forgot one setting. There needs to be a way to stop the FICA deduction once you've reached the maximum.",
Since the last update the latest material design doesn't have history option. But after switching to old style the history option is displayed.  Hope this issue is resolved in the next update.,
I like this app THE WAY IT WAS. Try multipling any number by .03 (or .0 anything) and it changes it to .3 so the answer is off by 10 fold. Didicult when you are trying caculate sales tax or commission.,
"I've been using this app for several years now.   I would of rated it a 5 however, as of the last update the calculator has been changed so that  you can't multiply by .0 decimals anymore. Not sure if there's a setting that can be changed but I've looked all over the app and no luck. I wish they would of left it as it was before. This latest update has caused this glitch.",
"Useful Calculator for many situations, well put together, thanks",
A must have calculator....... but yet to verify the results.... if formula used is also given it will be more useful and educative..... If possibly give little flexibility in few calculator which are meant for USA only e.g. inflation and retirement... etc,
Easy to use and easy to response  customers and also show them emi diductions chart.,
Good,
One of the best and must have apps,
Hi Where is the calculation that shows the saving if you make a lump sum payment into your bond account?,
Useful.,
Awesome,
I work as a Loan Officer dealing primarily with refinancing and new loans. I can easily compare rates and situations for my customers and actually show what they're saving between those scenarios. The added function of being able to email those numbers to my customers is excellent!,
I'd give it 5 again if the latest update hadn't glitched the basic calculator (no 0s applicable after decimal),
Plz add Fixed deposit calculation and Recurring deposit calculation,
Every thing that needs to be calculated can be.,

"This is a great all-in-one financial calculator tool. It's easy to use. No errors/lock-ups and I've used it on four different Android devices. I use it all the time to figure retirement estimates, interest on loans, even tips at restaurants. It even has a basic calculator. The best part is that it is FREE. It doesn't even have annoying pop-ups.",
"Great app. Would get 5 stars if it calculated the months needed to justify a home loan refinance, based on the increase loan amount due to closing costs",
Awesome app. Easy to use even if you only have a basic grasp on 401Ks and roths,
"I've spent time with each of the different calculators this has... And it's a lot.... And they are very well laid out,  intuitive  and fairly easy to understand,  even for the less financially versed. Plus,  the calculator will show you how the periods were broken put by period for most of the calculations... Very well done!!!",
"After having and using this app, I can finally delete 4 other calculator apps I have been using.",
Helps if you would like to amortize your loans or determine how much money you will have at retirement. Know your finances.,

Cant understand why a financial app hs no provision to calculate quarterly interest of some principal amount at a yearly rate.,
"Great features! Does not seem to compound Weekly frequency, correctly! I've compared this to several similar tools. Please correct.",
A very nice app even though the auto loan calculator does not calculate anything.  All the other calculators tried have worked well.,
"This app has so many great,  functioning calculators. All are simple to use as well. Definitely recommended! :)",
"I like how this app has a bunch of formulas to figure out how much to save for retirement, at what rate, age, how long the funds will last at different withdrawal amounts, and factoring in inflation. Nice!",
"The app does what it says and is quite comprehensive, but in the current version the formulae behind each calculations are missing. It should also include the formulae behind each calculation with basic descrption so the users can understand the logic/concept behind each calculation. It could also cover other financial calculations like business math (profit &loss/mark up/proportion etc)",
This is best app...you can not find better app,
"You can only input a % of salary for 401 (k), option to input a fixed amount needed.",
Comes in handy when you really need to sort out your stuff. Nice little tool to carry around with you.,

"I really want to like this app, and would love it if it worked fully. Some of the calculators simply don't work well or at all.  How long will my money last? I don't know because that calculator doesn't work very well. You can see the answers to the default amount but if you change the amount, it doesn't finish calculating and you can't get rid of the keyboard to see the bottom of the graph. Social security estimator? Doesn't work at all.  Retirement income calculator works fine though.  Needs much fixing. I hope they update it.",

"I have complained numerous times that there needs to be an option to eliminate PEMDAS in favor of straight calcs. Plus equals needs the option to terminate the calc. These are standard in regular calculators. Developer defends this weak design instead of listening and incorporating these options. Current design is USELESS to those of us who use complex calcs involving add/subtract and multiply/divide. Tired of waiting, excuses, and constantly wrong answers. Deleting and going to a real calculator.",
I am a car sales man and i user this app during my negotiations so I'm always accurate and able to stand my ground. It even does leases which is the best to have bc estimating them is almost impossible. Has so many uses and is never frozen or buggy. Bravo!,
"Great app indeed. Don't need finance calculator experience. Functions are well written out and not abbreviated like actual finance calculator. And numbers go into boxes next to the fields. Then simply hit calculate button. Best yet, the app can list all payments giving break down of how much principle, how much interest you're paying every month, and also balance of principle due! I've tried for a 360 month mortgage and got full break down for those many months!",

For the mortgage amortization, please add another option for extra annual payments in addition to the extra monthly amount because some people do both and it would be good to see how both affects the amortization schedule.  I would rate as five stars for that addition.",

I can't give this app nothing below a 5 star. This is one of the most productive app out there on the market. The developer took almost everything the users needed into consideration and this is how it suppose to be when developing an app. This is one app which I will always move from device to device. Let's say it will always be needed. The only things that's needed is that I wish all the various calculators could be access from a drop-down window/menu. Great app. Keep it up guys.,
"very nice app.. very usable  note: when in grid view in black the scrolling up and down after 2-3 times turned the icons to vanish, it happens everytime and have to restart app on my galaxy core android 4.1.2",
Future Value (FV) on TVM Calculators results always negative value please fix,
"This is one of the most us ed apps on my phone,  I use it to help me make purchasing decision with the discount and tax calculator.",
"I really like that app, it allow to use one application for all your calculates, home loans, car loans and many more.",
Required provision for calculating EMI based on Reducing/Diminishing Balance Interest Rate OR Flat Interest Rate. Also provision required to find interest when EMI is known. Use interface is simple and cool.,
"Feature rich and easy to use. Please include bill reminder, expense manager, etc., to make this still useful.",
Best app. For all finance related calculation. Very easy to use and Results are Presented in very easy and detailed format. 5 out of 5 star for this fantastic app. :-),
I just downloaded to a Note II and it works great. Seems to have anything I'll need for daily financial calculations all easily accessible. I have been looking for a calculator ago of this type for some time - good job.,
Well-chosen prompts mean no instructions needed. Results are displayed in clear easy-to-read format. This should be standard equipment on every Android device.,
Thanks for another best app. I wonder why you dont have expense manager for windows. Please let us know if you have it as could not find anywhere. Thousands are searching your windows app,
The mortgage calculator works but the calculator pad so that you can calculate the number that you want to input into the mortgage amount does not. So you can't add two or more mortgages for a consolidation or a percentage of a property value.,
"In compound Interest calculator there should option for days calculation.  E.g. interest rate 9.25/ annual,  Period 555 days. How I calculate this.",

It's a great app but it gives all its loan calculations as monthly payments only. There is no option for having weekly or biweekly payments. It's not simple to calculate weekly payments from monthly ones if you take the interest into account... I will need a separate loan calculator because of that,
"This is not just the best financial calculator but the best app ever found in market. This light weight app is unbelivably free, even if they charge 1000 for it I shall pay off.  I am a CFP and was using casio calculator worth 3000. Now this app repalced my calculator and its ui is great.Processing are fast.Zero bugs..zero error",
"Don't waste your time or your money on this crap... Crashed many times when I try to calculate something. (especially the NPV calculator) developer doesn't care about this free version, he just updates the priced version",
From Egypt I want to say thank you very much for sharing this app with us. You deserve 5 stars.,
use it for couple days and it is very useful for me. answer for all my finance calculations. I advise this app to all my friends and co-workers.,
Lovely app helps me work figures for my clients on the go.  I'd recommend the option of putting the deposit as a percentage as opposed to just a dollar value especially in the auto loan app.,
Untill I download this app..I don't know that there is anything called tip calculator. It's good app and as u use it u like it...and thus helps u in planning finances.,
"I find myself using this only a couple times a month - but wouldn't want to be without it.   Works nicely yet in the more complex academic style.  So some may find it to be perplexing, and rightfully so.",
Words cannot begin to describe how much I love this app. It is extremely useful and I really cannot find any flaws with it. Thank you!,
Its one of the best apps that I've used for financial calculation. The interface is very simple. Thanks and credit goes to the developer.,
"Started as a great experience until I started to calculate compounding interest. The numbers are WAY off, completely incorrect after one month.",
Everything I need and works great with no adds! UI isn't he prettiest thing to look at tho. With UI improvement and a better icon I would pay for a app like this.   Also a widget for the lockscreen would be cool. Tip calculator!,
This calc is great suplement for your regular calc app. Makes some complex calculations so simple. Only thing i don't like is it's UI which should be updated according to the Android recommendations.,
Working good But not fulfill my need I want some more kind of calculater Updated. Plz,
"Pretty much sucks, it will not calculate APR or interest - rates in TVM or APR mode given the other variables.  Don't waste your time.",
"Now that my GS3 has the 4.1.2 version of Android and is able to utilize the multi screen function, just make this app multi screen compatible so I can work the stock calculator with the loan calculator on the same screen and you've got 5 stars out of me. I'd actually give this app 4.8 stars the way it is now, but you can't choose that value.",
Can't add minus sign to bond calculator so it is useless.  The abbreviated number pad does not contain a minus sign! Very disappointing.,
Beautiful and very useful app... To support the great developers I'm always visiting advertisement... Thanks for such nice app.,
"Has more calculators than you are likely to need, but the ones you want are there. Very handy in a pinch.  Definitely recommended.",
"Does not allow saving of calculations, require reentry each time, inefficient",
Devoting time to Rate any app for the first time  So many features all in one app.  Very neat layout,
Add cloud feature...LIKE IF WE CAN SAVE OUR FILES TO THE CLOUD AS BACKUP SOMEDAY FOR OUR MOBILE PHONE IN CASE WE HAVE TO REFORMAT ALL...THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TO CLARIFY.,
Awesome app! I downloaded it for the retirement calculator. The only features I wish I could plug in is an assumed salary increase and adjustments for inflation.  I also tested out the PV calculator and the IRR calculator and they are awesome!,
Is this app. Is great but the irr calculate only positive cf calculate but not calculate as a negative cf please fixed it replied.thanks,
"If I had this an hour ago I would of passed my finance quiz. My teacher just said she allowing smartphones, man this is going to be awesome. Thanks. Way Easier than regular calcs. A must",
It's very useful for my work  and free but please display the factor rate in loans calculator.,
I have a few different calculators for debt management but this is the easiest by far...with a lot of features.,

"everything is good,but when i use TVM i can't get correct period number, always get 0 after i entered other factors",
This is a fairly limited calculator that has issues in its base calculator of future value. I'm fairly disappointed... I'll just build myself a spreadsheet and not get caught with my pants down....,
"I tried using the tip calculator the other day.  It's totally worthless, especially when traveling.  What's with the tax as a percent?  How often is someone going to know that?  It should ask for: food amount, tax amount, and total bill amount. Fill out two to calculate the third  then calc the tip based on the food total. What this thing does doesn't work.",
Just needs to have a help or tips. Takes time to get used to the data entry.,
Seemed useful at first. Hate the idea of needing access for a calculator. Look elsewhere.,
Exactly what I was looking for. Can add extra amount on top of loan payment to calculate early payoff and also compare refinancing with total interest saved. Can also email the results. I tend to take screen shots for easy reference.,
It is well design and programmed. You will love it,
Shocked the salesman when I figured out the lease payment within a few dollars of what he got in half the time. Great app!,
Very useful app with nice features. But crashes on 9 inch tablets with ICS.,
Ganesh  I can calculate easily . Useful for financial needs and accurate to see value  Free App .must have your application list  thank you,
Love this app .. best part for me is the loan amortization lets you add additional amount applied to principal .. and you can email the results,
"There were people in my financial planning class that went out and bought there's for 80$. Downloaded this in seconds, for free.",
Useful and free. Can't get better than this,
This one's got some great features and customisable displays. Love the currency converter feature that displays multiple currencies (of my choice) against a selected currency (of my choice). Basic calculator could use a facelift.Thanks heaps. A great tool for a great price!,
"Great job. Excellent tool that is simple to use. Works great on my galaxy nexus, nexus 7, and transformer prime.",
"I used this as a financial calculator for an investment course. It worked wonders, and was much easier to use than the ones my classmates paid $30-$50 for. Plus it was a reason to have my phone in my hand in class. Thanks!",

"What i like the most about this app is that I don't have to disclose my entire past and future private life to get it! As oppose to other really crappy ones. Awesome app, love it. All those other intrusive ones, stay the hell out of my phone!!!!",

"Nice to have this tool ,  only one thing can't input decimal point for interest rate when using loan calculator",
But this last update does not work for instance in the regular calculator the new unit conversion will gorse close whenever you enter a letter and some of the drop down menus are blank also on the tip calculator there is no option to tip on the food only and not the tax a lot of people do not like to tip off the taxed total. Please fix these items and I will be more than happy to give a 4-5 star review.,
Works great on my Galaxy 7 Plus. Has all of the essentials so I can leave the 12c at home :-),
"Uh, I used to serve tables back in the day, I know a good tip. (Bummer, I had high hopes for this little gem). But the tip calculator seems inaccurate. I thought I could use this tool for the rest of my econ classes... Seems shaky at best. Great idea... But I'd pay for a accurate app. HTC Rezound. Word to your mother.",
"Good aps  kindly edit option of date of deposit,maturity of deposit ,(date) accrual interest on particular date ,useful for calculation of receivables on particular financial year....",
Good calculator with lots of options. All work well but the tip calculator shows a total number at least 3 times what it should be. Please fix this.,
"This is a great tool, i hope that in future versions you can make a graph for the compound interest growth. But everything else is really handy Would be nice on the compound interest calculator to have choice between months and years, instead of only months.",
The real 5 star app. I find all my answers related to financial queries with this app. Thank u very much.,

Downloaded this as an upgrade to the standard calc app. There is a list of very useful calculation tools in here. Would be better to have the currency list in the currency converter based on the actual country names rather than the 3-digit currency identifier.,
"I love the menu when I first opened the app. It's easy to follow. Tried out the auto loan calculator and it had everything that someone would need: loan value, down payment, sales tax, trade-in and payment table. This is definitely a must if you want a loan calculator.",
Have this for att sgs2 and it exactly what I wanted.  One calculator to rule them all. This is similar to the IPhone 9in1 calculator which I loved.,

This is a very basic financial calculator with a poor interface. If you are looking for a real financial calculator you'll need to spend something. The least expensive but a full format financial calculator check out the one by Joaquin Grech.,
"This app is good. Easy to use interface, fast calculations, only gripe is the auto loan calculations are consistently higher payments than most others",
Great app. I'm smart enough to calc 0% apr loan by taking amt finance n divide by#pmts. Learned it in 4th grade and don't need financial calc 4 that,
"Very useful. It has a mortgage, auto, retirement, and several other calculators. Already it has helped me decide what to with my home equity loan.",
This the best application ever. It can calculate anything. I use this more than any of my applicant. It's a must have & very user friendly.,
WOW! Great app. I love it. Many apps that I normally have on my phone ALL in ONE amazing app. Thank you soooo much for a wonderfully working app.,
"I think the car loan calculator is not accurate, for example, my loan amount is 42k,4%,84months,the monthly instalment should be around 650,not 5sth",
Will sometimes use this instead of getting my 10bii. The decimal percentage works fine on the TVM calculator.,
Very easy to use with multiple types of financial calculators available. Will allow you to prioritize the list of options for easy access.,
Excellent.hats off buddy.what I was searching I found out. Thanks for such a nice application. Kudos,
"Great app, but the keyboard for the calculator is messed up on my sony ericsson arc.",
This is a great app. Very attractive and fun design. Caution: there is no option for begin mode in tvm function.,
I'm sorta a cheap-a** when it comes to apps but you should charge for this its very nice thank you,
"Definitely a good app to have. Helped me a lot while I was @ the dealer, calculating what my monthly payment would be.",
"Muy buena, muy simple para personas que no saben mucho de finanzas. Very recomended",
Just install 5 min ago and tried most of the features. Works great and for the right price FREE who could ever complain.,

"Will not calculate any loans with 0% APR. You can open reg calc app to do math, but shouldn't have to.",
"A+++ But When input should go to numberic pannel direcly and should release ads free version (Paid app), I will buy",
Love it but the basic calculator does not work. Very pleased just sucks having to have this icon and a seperate calculator icon on my home screen.,
Have used just the TVM app and that does not calculate returns correctly. So you might want to look for a more accurate calculator.,
"ok calculator, but doesn't have enough features and flexibility. try adding growth rate for starters",
I love that it has everything I've been looking for in a calculator. Additional principle amounts as well as amortization. Love it,
You just saved me from having to buy a $35 calculator for my Finance course. Thanks! Droid Incredible,
The regular calculator does not work. I hit it and it does nothing.,
Basic calculator did not work. All other calcs great.,
"Does exactly as advertised. Had sumthing similar on the pre, now have sumthing better.",
"Great app, now hopefully i use the info to get debt free =P",
"This is an awesome app. Does everything I need it to do, all in one spot.",
Great app! Comes with 8 different kinds of calculators and they're all very easy to use.,
"Great! Took with me to dealership when I bought my car... took my own advice vis payments, rates, options.",
The only tip calculator that does tax right and has some other cool stuff.,
Very effective and easy to use. Highly recommend to any financial geek.,
This is a great application. The screens are simple and intuitive in design. Thanks...,
Amazing creation. All calculations in one fast & simple application.,
All calcs work fine except the one I wanted. TVM. Doesn't seem to work.,
Basic calculator not working on Galaxy Tab,
Can' fault it. Easy to use. Highly recommended,
Gets better and better every update.,
Love the amortization schedule. 5 stars for functionality and free.,
Convenient and user friendly. A great app.,
Really good has everything you need!,
Basic calculator won't open.,
"Very useful app,a must have.",
Great all-in-one app and easy to use. Can't wait for next update.,
After using this no other calculater needed,
"No daily or continuous compounding? Too bad, so close to 5 stars.",
Love the functionality. 5 stars.,
Great app... does everything i need and more.,
Very basic features.,
"Awesome, HTC Evo",
Best financial calculators.,
App works very well Droid X,

Interesting!,
No positive/ negative button? Come on.,
Cool calculators.,
Great app.,
Really gud one,
Excellent,
"i.e., You want a new house, car or anything else that you will finance... At least throw some numbers with this app. You will know what you are getting instead of being told by the sales guy. So you can start talking about the price and not the monthly payment. But this is just one of the many things you will be able to do with the app. Good luck!",
"Wow, it has so many tools. I like all in one package this app offered. Some users reported certain calculations are inaccurate. Hope you guys improve and fix all issues. Very useful app. Well done guys.",
I am looking for an actually calculator. Like the TI - BA II Plus.     This app works great if you want to figure out your car payment.  It is not great if you are looking to figure out your car payment where payment increase or decreases in different intervals.,
I don't like giving 1 star ratings but I could not install because of a URI file issue.  The issue could be on my end as the previews look promising with 1 million downloads. Wish it would install.,
This app has all the right tools built in it for any financial need.  I use all options for car payments to tip calculations.,
"Giving it an average rating because when I left a box blank to work out a sum, it froze. If you fix that little problem I'd give it five stars.",
I understand free apps have ads.  These however are too intrusive.,
"This is a great app to have for most of your financial needs. However the Autoloan section of the app requires an option for breaking down the amortization period into weekly, bi-weekly options as well not just monthly.",
I tried finding an interest rate using time value of money and the app couldn't even figure that  out.  It gave me NaN  as an answer. I just wanted a simple number,
This appz can do almost all a 50$ financial calculator can do It save my money a lot Thanks,
It wont allow you to actually put in what your mortgage is and payment and percentages and taxes. It's not allowing the payments on our loan to be true so we can follow our amortization schedule,
Very nice app but i won't uee u5. Remove the Ad Banners.  I'd rather pay 5 or 10 bucks for the app. I don't care for ad Banners,
Request you to upload vedio tutorial of each features in youtube will be a great help and also more downloads you can expect.,
Its time to upgrade the design & icon. It looks so bad right now,
"Toshiba Thrive. Tablet 10"" This and STOCK QUOTE app are the BEST I have found to manage my stock portfolio. GREAT JOB.  AWESOME.",
Will still use excel for class however this is a great tool share with family and friends. it really shows the value of savings and compound interest.,
"This app is very easy to use and is very complete.   Best of all,  the support is increadibly fast.  Thank you.",
Iam also using expense manager from same developer which as good as this one. thanks for providing such great apps that also for free.,
The tip calculator is too complicated. Roi calculator is awesome. Not enough to keep it around.,
This is an okay app but occasionally it'll force close during cash flow use,
Good app. I love how it graphs the charts and everything but I wish the interface looked more modern. Also if they could add the ability to calculate final salary after federal and state taxes and 401k contributions that would be great.,
"You obviously need to understand how to use a financial calculator to get the results you need out of some of these calculators, but the interface makes it pretty easy to figure out even if you didn't. Thanks so much!",
I love being able to see how even as little as $2 a day (saved from coffee or eating out) can be saved into a large sum. Helps me not but splurge purchases. Highly recommend this app.,
Good for most basic calculations buti useless for quickly calculating your MM earnings,
Awful.  Froze on the first calculation before I could get the values input.,
"Same basic calc my phone came with, plus more functions that my old phone didn't have! All in 1 app!",
"There could be more settings under ""settings"" like entering the interest rates as per month  it's in general very good.thanks",
I use this app to see the exchange rate. It's very useful.,
Not feasible 4 layman,
Deletes number I input n replaces with crazy numbers nothing consistant,
Just what one good and googli'n well brokerage should mysteriously muster up for one's self.,
"I downloaded 4 different calculators and this one seems to be the best by far, with the way it looks, how easy it is to navigate, and  it has everything you could need for day to day use, plus more ! Highly recommended.",
"if you want a good financial app, get this. no crashes on my galaxy ace.",
Includes a basic calculator as well as over a dozen other financial calculators for different types of financial needs.,
"This is a great program, but it doesn't fit to screen on t-mobile mytouch",
need a basic understanding of financial formulas to run.  Very helpful for quick checks on rates/payments/returns.,
Better than any other apps. Efficient to look for other type calculation too,
I have been in banking for over 29 years and used a lot of other calculators and this by far has the most often used ones in a single app. Great job!!! Thanks for App!!!!,
Problem in downloading... It shows only 2.56MB but takes to much time n data during download.,
Not user friendly for someone trying to pass a principles of finance class,
this is a wonderful app but onece you start trying some calculations it is obvious that the formulas have errors. I really like the design but the errors make it useless,
This is the only auto loan calculator that factors trade in payoff and optional tax credit. I am in the car business and this app helps me! Glad the creators know what they are doing 5 stars!,
Lovely App ! If You Can Add Some Pro Feature Also Because I Am Free Recieving Man And Not Paid Recieving ! I Hope You Understand !,

"had this app for about a year. it was perfect for what i needed it for at first, but now it's practically unuseable. sections and tasks randomly duplicate and can't be deleted without also deleting unrelated items. i tried updating my app, which didn't help at all. sad to see it go, but i use my calendar every day, and the frustration of dealing with these glitches is simply not worth it!",
"It's been three months and the app still stops syncing periodically. It just hangs, as does the widget. The only way to recover is to delete the app's local data. And their support email address listed in the Play Store is still the same one that they don't actually support. I think it's time to finally give up :(",
The app is not intuitive. Subtask feature is great. Very hard to edit a task once entered. It is easier to just delete the task and re-enter it than waste the time searching for the place to edit the task. It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to move a task from the inbox to the project it needed to be in.,
"Great app. I pay for the subscription because I find the app invaluable for creating structure in my life. However, there was a recent update that changed how reminders are set, and while I do like the new feature, I wish they didn't remove the old one that allowed you to type a specific reminder with your keyboard. For example, I used to be able to type in something like, ""every other Sunday at 8am"", but now I can only select a specific date and time unless I use Todoist on my PC.",
"This app is the best todo list app. I have used this for almost 5 years I think, and it's been great for me and my husband. A todo list cannot get better than this one. However, my life circumstances have changed. This only works when I can do things, not when I want to give jobs to others. I have a kid now, and there are the family schedule, individual member's schedules, plus important things to always have in hand (notes), etc. Thank you todoist and good bye. [Edit below] We've moved to Twist",
"Really helps me keep track of things, love the integration of ""natural language"" for scheduling dates and times. If I had one complaint/suggestions it would be to make reminder notifications more noticeable. I feel I miss my reminders a lot. However, it's a small issue. Todoist has every feature I wanted from a To Do app, and more than a few I didn't know I needed.",
"I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there. There has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months, especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks, and it's been a bit frustrating there. But overall, it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions. Give it a shot!",
"So far, it's great. Just a small suggestion though: In ""comments section"" of tasks, if there are multiple images posted, and I click one to view, I should then be able to view the next one by swiping left/right. Instead I have to click off the image I'm currently on and scroll down the list of comments to find the next one. This was not intuitive to me, because in most SMS apps, whenever you view an image someone has sent you, if you swipe to the left/right, it will scroll through all images.",
"Very clean, well organized to-do list app. It makes completing tasks feel rewarding with the 'karma' feature. The 'projects' feature really helps to organize large projects into more manageable, easy to schedule tasks, which helps you to complete the larger project easily. The only thing I dislike is the fact that the free version does not come with all of the features unlocked, but this app is still my favorite to use even without the extra features.",
"I rely on this app daily for all my personal to do lists. But recent changes to functionality have made it less friendly to use than when I first got it.  For example it's much harder to add a time. Whenever I add a time to a task, it assumes I want to do it today, and I have to go back in and change it back to the original day.   Another annoyance is I can never use the word ""march"" in a task (like the March for Science) because the app thinks I mean the month. There are other words that happens with too, I can't recall them all right now.  Also like another use I don't like the circles on the left to check off the tasks, I keep deleting them accidentally.",
"Awesome but not perfect. Best I've found so far, and I've tried a ton. With a lot of my workflow being email/outlook based, the plug-in is incredibly helpful. It's a little complex, but with great power comes a bit of learning curve. I have an Android phone, an iPad, and work in Windows so the cross platform nature is key for me. Missing a couple things I think are key like being able to enter a completed date in the past (yesterday at least). I'm getting far more done using the app.",
I love this app and I count on it to keep me organized but am not crazy about the latest update. I love that my list appears larger and easier to read but I don't like how it automatically deletes it when an item is hit. I've accidently lost items on my grocery list several times. It has left me feeling less secure that I've crossed everything off my list.,
"Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either. So, no backward search for the events, calendar sharing and other integrations. Well, task and project-wise, this is a powerhouse! Much more simple and well designed than Google Keep I've been using for years.",
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first.",
"It's a great app, but just like any organization app, you have to meet it halfway with actual effort. If you don't actually intend to complete the work, don't kid yourself by getting the app. I only wish it included a calendar that displayed events in chronological order along with the list of events in bullet point format and that it sent reminders of events. I'm very picky about apps, but this one is actually nice.",
"Best to do list I've found. I used to use Trello but it didn't work for me. This does everything Trello didn't. Love the Inbox and how i can access it from a widget on my phone with one press. Also i have the other widget that shows my list of choice. I love how you can schedule items just by typing when you want them, even if it repeats. It's a very smooth interface. A few of the premium features would be really nice to have. It's tempting but i don't like recurring fees. I'd rather pay once.",
"Very good to do list app! Looks nice, easy to create new tasks with the automatic detection of dates, times, priorities, and topic. Does not show ads and is pretty generous with the free version. My only issue so far has been occasional desync between devices (can be solved by logging out and logging back in). Also, note that the free version doesn't allow you to set reminders.",
"Seems like a pretty cool app, I like how quick it is to set up tasks. Would be great for some people's situations, but since I'm looking for something for personal use and have no need for additional projects, larger files (or files in general), or filters it is a waste of money to pay a monthly subscription just to be able to set up any reminders at all. Guess I'm back to my search for a good todo list app...",
"Mostly pros but one big con.. Absolutely love this app. It is really is user friendly and has helped me so much with organizing my life. One big con though is I had a big issue with the Google calendar integration. I had to disconnect it as it messed up my calendar and I lost a bunch of data that I needed to reenter. Luckily, it was uploaded to todoist so I didn't have to hunt for it. I really hope they fix that issue.",
"I've been using todoist for years now and it's nice being able to access my list from my phone or computer. Bad news is that with the latest update, the ""add task"" widget won't work. It said the app doesn't exist, so I tried to remove the widget and place it again, but it makes the Home UI crash every time. It did the same thing on my husband's phone.",
"Updated review to 4 stars from 1. The usability was very poor, but I looked online, and on youtube and eventually solved main problem. It was that when I made subtasks in Today view, they remained as original, but also in the new list as well (subtasked only there)! So I had a lot of duplicates. I stand by my earlier assertion that this is very poor usability from a new user's point of view. Also, I upgraded to premium and it is annoying that they charge 30 dollars up front (annual), instead of a reasonable monthly charge. However it is proving helpful and I look forward to future changes as well. Original review: Poorly designed, subtasks listed in a nonsensical manner. Doing basic things such as un-checking items a hassle.",
"I love this app! I've tried a few other task list type applications, but this one really takes the cake! Their format is very flexible and has all the basics offered for free...except reminders. Data syncs well across devices, you can create subprojects, stacked task lists, and many other useful features! I check Todoist throughout my day and it's working well for me so far. If you need reminders, check out their premium version! It has plenty of features that are actually worth paying for. ;)",
"Reliable, flexible, easy to use. I have more flexibility in organizing my to-do list the way I want to see it, and still use GTD. Only minor drawback: wish there was another way to set repeating tasks other than putting it into words. Putting it into words might seem easier than the menus seen om most other To Do apps, but you have to put the words in a precise way and even then it might still take a few tries before Todoist picks up the repeat request.",
"Simply brilliant. Everything you could want. Thoughtfulness is the word that comes to mind whenever I discover a new feature. Some awesome big features like location reminders and integrations, and tons of clever little features too. free version has a respectable collection of features that don't let you down, but I'm seriously considering getting the premium version.",
"this app has been great for keeping track of what I have to do each day. it conveniently syncs on all of my devices so it's always up to date no matter where I am and what device I'm using. it's easy and satisfying to mark something as ""complete"". it reminds you when you have overdue tasks, but gives you the option to quickly reschedule them to another time so you dont feel guilty. all in all, it's a great app that does exactly what it needs to do! highly recommended!",
"So I'm moving over to this app from TickTick because I like how it looks. I believe ticktick is more condusive to time management, but Todoist seems like the better overall to-do list app. The big problem I am having is stability. When trying to create a label within a to-do, it crashes. I've also experienced crashes when switching projects. I subscribed thinking the $8 extra would be a better experience, but so far I'm a bit concerned. I'll give the app a few weeks before giving up.",
"I recently moved from a job where I utilized Microsoft Outlook's tasks. I struggled to find an app that could perform as well as Outlook. This app does everything and more! On PC...I love the predictive typing, Google Chrome attachment, flagging emails, typing notes, attaching files, reminders, and more. And it syncs across all my devices. On the app I love how fluid it is. It is so easy to use! After trying literally almost every to do app out there, this one gets my five stars! I have tried Google Tasks, Microsoft tasks, Wunderlist, Any.do, and many more. I've even paid for a majority of them. This one is well worth the money!",
"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.",
"Love the minimalist nature of Todoist. It's exactly the right number of features. Inbox, projects, quick add tasks with keyword support - all great features that make the app quick and easy to use. Too many other to-do apps are overly complicated. This is by far the best one I've come across. (Free version, single user.)",
"It is a great to do app that takes a little while to find all the customization possibilities for, but when you do it works wonderfully, and even the free version is clean with no ads as I'm writing this. The biggest change I'd like to see is the ability to visualize progress through goals, daily tasks and overall projects in a more helpful way that shows the percent progress made in each priority level.",
"I had been looking for a to do list app with projects and connection to my calendar. There's a lot of stuff out there, but for some reason I fell in love with todoist. I saw it in a few YouTube videos and tried it out for myself and it has worked flawlessly. Two of my favorite features are projects and synchronization of my calendar and todoist on both sides. So if I add something to todoist, it gets added to my calendar and vice versa. Awesome, awesome utility!",
"Best GTD app. If you are building a list system based on David Allen's book getting things done, I think this is absolutely the best app to use for that. I have had GTD systems on Evernote, Onenote, Microsoft to do, and a paper notebook, and this is by far the best in almost every way. It's easy to use, has no bugs, has a bunch of great bells and whistles, and it syncs seamlessly across all platforms. The user experience is great too. It draws me in to my lists, rather than repelling me.",
"Taking off a star because I'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update. I'm not a fan of having to click the drop-down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once. Especially because the task selection mode expires each time I make a single change to the selected tasks, requiring me to then go into the drop-down menu again to and then re-select all of the tasks I just selected. I really liked before how I could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks. I know this change was made to allow easy re-ordering of tasks, although I don't find this particularly helpful because I don't typically re-order my tasks. I would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once.",
"Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.",
"After trying *so* many different time management apps (even the $200/yr ones), this one the best. I love that the date you type in the add task bar automatically assigns it to the date. You can set events, tasks, and reminders all with voice to text while driving! The only thing I'd *love* is a more conventional ""calendar"" view where I can easily see what's in store for the month with one glance. Keep up the good work!",
"The app looked very promising, but there were too many ""Upgrade to premium"" notifications when initially clicking through the app. From what I saw, I probably would have paid for a year if I was able to try out the fill app first. Instead, I got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications. For these reasons, 3 stars and lost buisness.",
"This app has improved my life so much. It's true that once I get the tasks written down, it clears my head for better management of the rest of my day/responsibilities. I can either make a list of things to do in general or assign tasks to certain days/times. I can make different lists for different projects. I REALLY ‚ù§Ô∏è the homescreen widget that I see whenever I check my phone. Some features you can choose to pay for, but the free version has enough features to do what I need. Never deleting!",
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!",
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.",
Perfect for organizing big life goals and daily tasks all in one. I've been using the pro version for 5 years now. I love how easy it is to organize tasks within one another and i use the scheduling features to their fullest extent. I use it on all my devices. Works well with small teams too. Now i never worry about losing an idea or missing a task. It's all written down forever and I never have to worry about what I forgot.,
"Love this app! It's easy to use, and once you get used to it, it gets even easier. It's the first app I've ever actually stuck to, because of its goal setting. It gives ""Karma"" points for successfully marking things off, and makes me want to stick with it. I emailed the developers with a question just one time, and they were quick and helpful with their response. The Premium version is worth every penny!",
"Incredibly convenient and simple, but I hope that the feature to attach photos (from your gallery or straight from your camera), links, and documents can be without the premium. Just a really naive wish, coming from a student. Other than that,  this app is really good, and its customer service is as admirable. Good job!",
"This is a great to-do app. The interface is easy to use and looks great. Natural language scheduling works really well. ToDoist is supported on a wide variety of platforms. This includes Android and IOS. I really like that there is a phone app and web browser access. You can share projects with other users. Things to note: if you want to schedule your day, you can set due dates and time but you are better served using a calendar app. ToDoist isn't well suited for recurring checklists.",
"This is by far the best tasking app out there. As someone who struggles with ADHD, this has been a lifesaver. It can sync with calendars, remind you of things based on location or time, and lots of other cool things. The interface is intuitive and tasks can be as simple or as detailed as needed. Additionally, it can work as a kanban board and be used among teams if needed. It works on and syncs across web, mobile, even my smart watch. Could not recommend more.",
This is a great system! I'm pretty disorganized so I'm of the opinion that if it works for me and the mess of my life that exists it must work for everybody. The only thing it needs is an inbuilt monthly calendar. PARTICULARLY for events/appointments. Also while I am aware that reminders are for premium only (and as such are not a factor for losing a star) i am slightly unsure whether or not the reminder works like an alarm system where it will buzz at the time that you have set for the event.,
"One of the most useful apps I've ever used. It has a charming, professional interface that takes to-do lists to another level. For someone whose life runs on systems, this is imperative to making sure my day gets done. It has saved me many times and offers some nice extra features with a premium subscription that is very helpful but possibly not necessary for everyone. I could go on but I'll just say try it and make your own conclusions.",
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? The old widget could do things the app couldn't, and can't. Give it back! Matters have improved, though - it's now easy to open the app from the new widget.",
"It's a fine task manager app, a little bit hard to get at first with the weird natural language based task creation, but if you're willing to put in the effort it's pretty intuitive. The one big deal breaker for me is that if you have a daily recurring task it becomes overdue at midnight. If you tap it complete after midnight, it completes it for the next day which ends up with you missing a day unless you remember to do it on your own or manually set the next recurrence to today.",
"I use this app everyday at work--it's a great app with lots of options for keeping tasks organized. However, the latest update seems to have introduced a bug. Sometimes, while adding sub-tasks to a task, the app will auto-complete everything. All sub-tasks will simultaneously mark themselves as completed, and the only way to undo it is to go back and uncheck them one by one. Sometimes the cursor will also skip to the ""Comments"" box while in the middle of writing a sub-task.",
"This app has helped me re-establish good habits, remember things when I couldn't afford to forget (very forgetful person) and conquer my procrastination bit by bit. The slightly gamified interface helps to make the app fun, and more personalized for me. I do wish it were a little more like a game, some level-ups and rewards wouldn't hurt. Overall, very useful and encouraging. Doesn't feel clingy or noisy.",
"This is my dream personal planning app. I love the design, it looks and feels great to use. It's simple and intuitive but also very powerful. There any plenty of ways to group tasks, and the filters are very powerful for viewing them however you want. And it's fully featured. It has collaboration, a great widget, and integrations with a lot of other apps, including Google Assistant.",
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.",
"A few days in and so far so good. Definitely has a few non-intuitive functions. Setting custom reminders is weird...a pop-up should just appear to select a date and time, but instead you type it in then it tries to interpret what you type, then you select it if it is right. Very convoluted. Finally found the task completion statistics. Its next to your profile icon/picture when clicking on the three horizontal lines top left. Small circle with squiggly arrow with some numbers next to it.",
"What is the point of a ""To Do"" list without reminders? Nope, you don't get a notification reminder unless you pay for premium, you can't even try it to see if it will work better than Microsoft To-Do (which can't stay running for anything). Without notifications/alarms I can make a ""To Do"" list using a notebook & pen or the paper calendar I have on my fridge! The whole point of searching for a useful app is to use modern features, like reminders/alarms & custom days, dates, & times.",
"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works.",
"To start, notifications shouldn't be a premium feature. The main reason I want a to-do list on my phone is so I can get more from it, including reminders. Second, even the free features didn't function as the guide said they would. I tried to add a recurring task for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as per the instructions, but it wouldn't even do that. Edit2: sent image confirming smart recog is on, but you can't screenshot with the keyboard on and cannot turn keyboard off while setting time.",
"Great to-do list app, I just wish the task widget was more responsive. It's a bit annoying to tap a task to check it off, it takes a second to actually check off, and then wait several more seconds for the list to refresh before you can interact with anything else. I primarily use the widget to interact with the app, so the way that functions is very important to me.",
"No easy way to view your completed tasks. Everything else about this app is great, but this one missing feature is a HUGE dealbreaker. For 90% of people, the benefit of a todo list is to see what you have done easily, and get a sense of achievement from it. If they added that feature I'd give it 5 stars, but I find this app unusable without this feature.",
The app itself is good but the voice integration on Android is not intuitive nor powerful. I have to jump through several hoops to get my task logged and it often ends up wrong. This might be an issue with Google as well. But I am looking for a quick way to get tasks logged when I can't type. Instead I find my self fumbling to press buttons again...,
"Hi, The app's interface and usability is pretty good. But the time zone feature has some bugs. If I set a different time zone on my device and a different one within the app, it causes problems. I was hoping that you guys could overcome those. It would help a lot of students stuck with asynchronous learning and online classes ü§íü•≤.",
"Great todo app with minimalistic UI, however there is a bit of missing potential. The app is fairly full of features, however for key things like notifications you aren't given many settings to customize them. Another example is you can't have tasks auto-scheduled based on the project it is in or the labels it has. I paid for a subscription (only $4) to test out labels and everything this app and the desktop version offered and I was a bit underwhelmed by the lack of automation features.",
"Easy to use. It takes a second to get used to controls but then it super easy. I use the widget to add task throughout the day. My list stays condensed in my notifications. Only when I click on it, does it show me everything on my list. I love this app because it helps me remember things, and helps me stay on track when I have a million things going at once (I'm a Mom, Wife and Student).",
"Overall, the interface is just ok. It's difficult to sometimes figure out where to type things to add the event to your list and changing the date on an event can be annoying as well. Then you have to pay to even set a reminder alarm... But it functions well and is a fairly straightforward layout.",
It does what it needs to. I just wish instead of email notifications when things were over due that I would get push notifications instead. I think it is hard to balance having a free tool and a paid version for something like this and the free version gives you the bare minimum. I dont know how the paid version would provide me with any better service as an individual than the free version aside from push notifications.,
Love this app! started with the free version and upgraded right away. It really helped me get my life and schedule under control when I started my business. I am still learning some of the more advanced ways to use it and find it gets more and more helpful with time. I love that i can send emails directly to it and make them into tasks and also i totally get into tracking my progress and getting points! im a geek like that LoL,
"I have been on a mission to find a to-do list that syncs well between my phone, smartwatch, and google calendar. I have tried just about every to-do list out there and in some aspect, every single one of them fell short. I was about to give up hope when I came upon this app! Thanks to this app, I am now the organized and productive person that I always knew I could be but never could find the right tool to make it happen!! Thank you!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
"I love the app. I just wish there was an option for a one time payment for premium. I have too many subscriptions, and I always cancel new subscriptions in a short amount of time because I find that I don't use the app enough to pay monthly or yearly. The apps that I can pay once for premium are the apps I usually stick with. I use this a lot for tracking my spending and budget, so a subscription is kind of counter intuitive.",
"I am a fan of GTD which is really just a system of lists. I have tried all the big name task managers out there. Todoist is by far my favorite. Once you catch on to the natural language processing it is so easy to record everything that comes to mind in the ""In"" box then do a review later to decide what to do. Since I always have my phone I use the notification bar icon to record stuff as I think of it. Nothing ever gets lost or forgotten. It is wondeful to have a septem you can depend on!",
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it.",
"Truly my favorite to-do list app I've ever tried. My one small quibble is that it always has trouble accepting multiple keywords, for example if it's Monday and I need to set up an items that is weekly on Tuesdays, I can't just type ""Tuesday weekly"" but have to go tinker around in the settings. I'd also like more customization over the look, with fonts and colors.",
"I really like this app and use it everyday. However, these new Pop Ups that come out of nowhere congratulating me on checking off tasks are incredibly annoying. I don't need a digital pat on the back. Maybe some people like that and that's great. Personally, I just want to keep checking off tasks or looking at what's next to do and these pop ups just get in the way of that and irritate me. Can you please make it so I can turn them off? I've searched the settings and I can't find it anywhere.",
"Newest update completely renders filters and upcoming useless. Just a white screen. Testing before launching changes obviously didn't happen. Edit: the newest update renders the app functional. However, it is still very glitchy. Upon selecting filters, the view is not updated until you scroll the screen. And filter names are truncated to 2 or 3 letters.",
"The perfect todo app. It's so easy and quick to set up really powerful filters and workflows to make sure you're focusing on the tasks that matter most. Not to mention the performance and UX is super snappy, so you can note, organize, and check off tasks without wasting time you could spend getting things done fumbling with the app.",
"This little app got me through my finals this quarter. The simplicity and variety of scheduling options makes it very useful. At first I thought premium was dumb and I wouldn't need it, but they offered a free 30 day trial without having to add my credit card and I quickly got addicted. Once the 30 day trial was over I couldn't go back so I paid the 36$ year which I would say is extremely reasonably priced. Very recommended, especially for school. Helped me stay on track and never miss any hmwk",
"It's good, but the layout requires an extra click to get to the calendar week view, and that's my favorite view because I want todoist to be my weekly planner. If I have to click into the app, click the side bar, and then click into the calendar view, it's too much work. Those three views (today, calendar view, etc) I would like clickable like at the bottom always, or the ability to swipe between the views.",
"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget. These are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule. The widget could be improved, otherwise the app is great.",
"Fantastic app. I needed something like this to improve my productivity with reminders for work, and this app delivers more with cool features like projects, tags, priorities, comments, and so much more. The smart-typing and interpretation of text is amazing to set specific dates and tags just by typing, it really speeds up the process of creating tasks, which makes it easier to use and way more functional. I highly recommend the app, and the unlocked subscription fee is incredibly reasonable!",
"This app is easy to learn and use, and yet so powerful. It has been extremely robust and supports every common desktop and mobile platform. Adding a task with natural language scheduling is such a breeze! It also supports queries to view your tasks in many different ways. The free version is complete and usable, with no ads! But I'm seriously considering upgrading to pro just to support these developers. It takes a lot of skill and dedication to make an app this robust and well designed.",
"I used Apple Reminders for a while until I switched ecosystems. You have to pay to get the most out of it, but it's worth it to me. Excellent integration with Google Calendar and it works on all my platforms (Windows, Android, and Chromebook). Helps out a lot. Not the best voice assistant integration, but still great!",
"So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.",
"Over time I've tried a lot of to-do list apps. Todoist has long been one I've come back to over and over and finally, I've settled on it as my favorite. During the past few years Todoist has helped me stay focused to grow my freelance business. It's also helped me when I get anxious and overwhelmed. I can easily set my daily list to just a few manageable tasks and move things to the back burner or ""inbox"". I love Todoist and its Getting Things Done methodology.",
"Very positive so far. Installed the app about a week ago and it took a couple of days before I felt entirely comfortable with it. The learning curve is very modest overall, it's one the few to-do list applications that's truly multiplatform. It have it installed on my iPad, Windows PC and Android phone (OK already! I kno6, and so far it has performed brilliantly. I'll update this eval if I run into any issues. but so far so good. Highly recommended...",
A little difficult to get the hang of. But all in all a great app. Only issue I'm having is that my recurring subtasks show up twice on my daily checklist which clutters up the list. The duplicates also appear outside the main task so I can't unexpand them to clear up the clutter. Other than that everything works well so far.,
There are so many to do apps out there and so many comparison articles it was difficult to even choose one. I tried several and this one definitely seemed like the best so I purchased the premium version and it is great. Save yourself some time and aggravation just get this one. Try the free version first. The premium cost is $3 per month subscription bille yearly for $36 and although there is no free trial of the premium version you do have 30 days for a refund if you don't like it but you will.,
"Awesome App overall. I like how you can create separate lists for different categories. However I'd appreciate if the subtasks could be reworked to allow for the main tasks and the subtasks to be marked as completed separately. The reason I use subtasks in the first place is because they're related to my main task, yet I need to complete them at different times than the main task. Right now if I mark one as complete, the whole thing is marked as complete, which defeats the purpose.",
"Very fun and intuitive app! Completing a task is rewarding, and the app is very good at notifying me of my tasks for the day. It is also great at organizing my tasks, and I love the option of adding a task to the Inbox - a great way to still add something without the immediate need to file it under a category. One issue I have is on Wear OS: on my Fossil Gen 6 (Wear OS 2), scrolling with the rotating crown causes a frenzy of vibration and the app to freeze. Please fix this!",
"I got lucky that this is the first to-do list app I have ever used. It is excellent in every way! It allows you to add items, prioritize items, move items around on your list, categorize items, and has multiple inboxes all with the free version. More options are available for the premium version if you need them.",
"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that.",
"I adore this app. I type in everything I need to get done, then sort it all by date and priority. At the beginning of the day, I pick three tasks to rate as priority one. At the end of the day, I can easily postpone tasks I didn't accomplish without feeling bad. I feel organized, and like I can finally tackle my seemingly endless to-do list in a logical manner.",
Its good. WAY better than when I first tried it. The features are excellent. Esp because I use it mainlie for life stuff and to get the functionality it offers most productivity apps make you pay a per user fee. I've tried about 9 in the past year and a half so im prettie confident in the quality of Todoist. Runner up Asana as a for instance doesn't automatically remove completed tasks on their free version... bananas.,
"So-so app. The way to move a task to a different Project from the search results is obscure ‚Äî as described in the developer's response here, it requires scrolling a list that shows no visible indication it can be scrolled. In other contexts, swiping the task right provides a Move option; but, as is common with Microsoft, the way to move a task in the search results doesn't match how it works in other contexts, and isn't obvious at all.",
"I recently completed the forced upgrade for the app, and now it doesn't work consistently.....repeatedly, the app has frozen up completely and none of my tasks appear. If I'm able to get it working again (aftet multiple restarts), all the changes i made in recent sessions are gone. It worked perfectly before. I'm SO annoyed! I've been a todoist user for years, but if this isn't fixed, I'll switch to something that works consistently (already made that switch, for work projects).",
"Absolutely love this app because this is a digital version of how I've always organically done it. Can assign things to projects or labels. Have due dates and repeating events but also no dates if you want! Love how the website/desktop version is so similar to the app that navigating between the two is a breeze In terms of minor changes I'd like to be able to repeat but ""every other day"" or ""every monday, Tuesday, and Thursday"" for semi regular events/chores/tasks. Overall 10/10",
"I'm an OCD business owner and this app is perfect for me. If you want clean widgets on your home screen for quick and easy tasks and goal setting this app beats all the others. I personally wasted 12 hours researching and playing around with the task and to do apps and these guys take the cake. Great UI, great customizability, not too try hard. I love how you can create lists for different things and set different categories on the same list so you don't have to hit back when swapping lists.",
"You don't have to pay for Todoist for it to be useful. At its core it is a digital to do list with flexibility for whatever you want to throw at it. You can schedule recurring routines easily, break down large projects into smaller subtasks and organize it all to your liking. I use Todoist as a big picture planner. The desktop program is what I use for weekly planning and task input. But when I'm out in the world making it happen the phone app is just as valuable. I say give it a try!",
Prepare to pay. It looks like a very useful app if you pay for it. The basic features I have access to for free are good; easy to use & had a nice front end user experience. I can't give 5 stars because I'm not going to pay to access the extra features when I can use Samsung Notes for free for the same basic abilities. I don't need it bad enough to pay.,
"The repeat option is nonexist. The only time its allowed me to repeat a task is ""every month"". At first I thought ""every two weeks"" might be too confusing for it but I tried ""every week"" and ""every day"" and it doesn't pop up except for that first day. Also the fact that it often lists the scheduled date as ""today"" despite me not yet picking a date is stupid, and it resets to ""today"" automatically when I try to edit the task in any way (like change the name). It doesn't make any sense!",
"Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.",
"I really like this app and the smart tags feature of being able to tag it on a project which is super quick. You can also use boards like in Trello. A lot of really great functionality in this app. The only issues I've had is syncing between desktop app and phone a few times, but once I logged out and back in on app it synced my tasks so hopefully that will get fixed soon. I haven't tried doing that again, but I will soon.",
"Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!",
This thing just keeps getting better and better. These guys are doing great. I loved the google calendar integration and discovered to my delight today that since its inception it has been improved on and I can now add a separate calendar integration per list for those few lists that need it. Sync is instant and oh so helpful. Thanks a lot guys!,
"My experience has been hit or miss. After listening to the developer on the YNAB podcast recently, with my new role in IT as a Solutions Architect, there is immense value in a proper organization and to do list application, especially task boards. Paid for premium. Unfortunately, when clicking a label in the left nav in favorites, it does nothing and you're still left viewing the Inbox, Today or Upcoming pane you were in. It doesn't filter or behave as it should. Edit: I was doing it wrong!",
Pros: Can add two levels of subtasks to tasks. Four priority levels. Can drag tasks up and down to prioritize them further. Any number of color coded custom labels can be added to each task. Dark theme available. Cons: NO reminders without paying every month which is pretty bad. I understand charging for premium features but reminders on a task manager is one of the most basic features possible. Can't find a way to backup. *Also: stop deleting my reviews...,
Genuinely out of this world. This app goes above and beyond in creating a seamless organising system that really allows you to get your mind off and scribble as many thoughts as possible and then organise them. And it tracks it perfectly. It syncs with the PC version excellently and rewards you for every task done making you feel the progress and it gives you many metrics to further illustrate how much you've done in a short period of time. One of the best out there üëç,
I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.,
"It's okay. I thought it would be much better for tracking recurring tasks. Once you miss a task, it just says overdue. Even if it happens multiple times a day, you won't be getting reminded again. Not worth paying for pro with notifications if this is how it works. I paid for a year but I won't be renewing if this doesn't change.",
"Awesome! Best of all worlds. Inbox for ideas that doesn't clutter priority items to get done. Easy scheduling and projects with multiple layers of sub projects. Easy to hide sub projects and assign to different days. Easy to tag, prioritize, sort, etc. In the past, I would use a list, it would get cluttered and overwhelming, then I would start a whole new list in defeat. With Todoist, I actually get to the end of my list, before the end of the day.",
I almost went with TickTick because of the calendar within the app and the habits feature. But in the end I just couldn't pass up the level of organization that Todoist offers. I have ADHD and I really need visuals to get through my days. This app seems to work well with how I think. I feel good at the end of the day when I can clear out my tasks. The integration with Google calendar is useful for planning my days. I will most likely pay for premium.,
"I'm not 100% happy with how it's set up, but it's working well enough to help keep me organized. Since it's a web based app, I can still access my info when my phone acts up, and I won't lose all my data again the next time my phone craps out and I have to do a factory reset. My main complaint is that it doesn't work exactly the same as the other app that I'm already used to, but that one didn't reliably back up and I lost my data one too many times. I'll get used to this one.",
"Todoist is an excellent app with excellent support. I use Todoist to help stay on top of the flow of information coming at me, have and also utilized the repeating task function for regular checklist items. I also love using the labels for contextual tasks, like emails, calls, errands, at home, at computer, etc. It's been a game changer in my ability to be productive and efficient. Todoist support is awesome, too. If you're looking to become more productive and retain a sense of control over the things you are (and are not) doing, HIGHLY recommend this app! I also recommend reading GTD.",
"Worthless app. Have been using the premium version for 6 months now, and much preferred the previous free version from over a year ago that had the auto reschedule function in case you actually try to intentionally write down more than you can accomplish in a day to make sure things don't fall through the crack. Wish I had known thay feature was removed before purchasing, but without it, it's actually more work than just writing it as a simple checklist.",
"Very handy app. They are tons of tips and tutorials about how to get it to practically sit up and roll over. Really does help with productivity. Works with Alexa for the most part too. Updated now that I've used it for a while. I have the Pro version now, and it's very handy, especially for looking back at completed tasks. I know there are lots of tricks I don't know yet, but I do recommend this product.",
"It is an effective todo app with some unique and useful features. Paying $3/month for the premium subscription might be worth it...I'm still deciding on this app vs Wunderlist, the one I've used previously. Predictive typing for things like ""by today at 5pm"" is great but the free version has limited capabilities with reminders. Happily, no ads. It works nice between multiple platforms which is essential, especially since you can key things in on the PC VERY quickly. Karma points help motivate.",
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",
I appreciate how easy it is to create and modify a To-Do List. The ability to group multiple Lists under a Project Title is very useful. I also like the Sub-Task feature which allows me to add details to a specific Task. Another feature that I found to be helpful is the email notifications that monitor my scheduled Tasks. The Application feature set is well thought out. I would recommend this application to anyone who needs an organizational tool to help them be more productive.,
I set multiple test reminders to see what kind of notification I'd receive and I haven't gotten a single one. I checked permissions and settings to make sure nothing turned off by default. I set a few at different times for reminders and they all passed by with nothing. No push or emails or anything. I can't exactly recommend using a reminder app that doesn't actually give you reminders.,
"Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.",
"I really like this app... It's unique in that the commands are very simple and it can recognize plain-text times and dates, and organizing each entry into sections, or ""projects"" is easy. I would recommend setting up the app online or on a computer because managing projects and sub-projects is difficult within the app. My one regret is that the app is broken up into calendar days. I, and a few others don't necessarily consider it ""tomorrow"" until I've gone to sleep and woken up the next day. I'll have a daily task, like reading, that can float through my day... often times I'll get it done in the might before I go to bed, other times it'll happen in the afternoon when I have free time. I can schedule my reading task daily, but if I complete the task at 12 AM on the night of November 1st, it counts as ""tomorrow"" and won't automatically reappear until November 3rd. I propose that Todoist have a night-owl setting, in which we late-nighters can define when our days end. I don't want my reading to count for November 2 if I'm completing the task for November 1 before I've gone to sleep. I don't want Todoist to skip that task to November 3 even if it is the next calendar day because I won't have done my reading for November 2. I wish that we would be able to define our 24 hour period as one day instead of solely relying on Calendar dates.",
"I occasionally check out other list tools, buy come back to this one. The full UI works great, but the widget doesn't work that well on Android 12 - it behaves far better on my tablet stuck on Android 10. On my phone it often double/triple reloads, and some reloads just spin until opening the app. Plus, either due to that or having a smaller phone, I mostly fail trying to mark the completion bubble. bubble.",
"My experience with Todoist has been great. It has helped me keep track of all my college assignments that I must complete. It's also helpful that it reminds you when things are overdue. Making the list is very simple as well. All you do is press the + button, type the thing you need to do, press the > button, and BAM! you're all set.",
"This app is my lifeline but it's insanely buggy the past couple weeks, and keeps crashing. Always has had a problem syncing with browser extensions as well. Either browser or the app won't update globally. Usually it's the browser that won't but lately the app won't update and the browser extensions are the only ones working properly. Please help fix this todoist! All the typical troubleshooting is not helping. 2.14 edit back up to 5 stars - update fixed! Woohoo üôåüéâ",
"I've tried multiple to-do list organizer applications and have found Todoist to be the best for me. Sync was a big problem cross platform for me even using Microsoft's To-Do. I'd create my lists ans tasks on my PC and then go to pull them up on my phone when on the job site onky to find nothing I had entered was there. This happened time and time again. so began my search and I found Todoist. It is fast, easy to organize. You can tag, prioritize, add photos. I really like the karma too!",
"Best task manager I have EVER used. Much more usable than most gamified task managers, but still has a nice experiemce point and goal mechanic. Completely intuitive. Hotkeys make it fast and easy to input tasks, and having multiple project lists . My favorite feature is how I can dump an entire semester's worth of homework in my todo list at once, not get overwhelmed, and know that it will show up in my daily task list right on time. I recommend this so often.",
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.,
decent app for phone use although there are better options that offer more features for free if you strictly want to use only one phone. what makes this stand out is the integration with other devices such as android wear which allows you to add and complete tasks from your watch and easily see the next task you need to complete.,
"i love this app very much! its organization is so efficient and i love how you can automate recurring tasks and the projects are so amazing! will be looking into possibly getting premium. my only thing is i wish there was more graphics/fonts/theme options. I understand simplicity is the premise, but I like having a pretty schedule or at least a personal looking one. even if not, a pink theme for premium please üò≠ but other than that it is a fantastic app!!",
"After turning off *all* of the notifications, it's exactly the To Do app *I* need. Instead of sixty sheets of paper with projects I'm working on or was working on or ideas for art or groceries or whatever! I have this. I've been using it about a week, and so far, I think it's working out rather well.",
"The best feature is detecting date and time while typing. Free version is very good and doesn't annoyingly pester you with popup ads. I wish I could individually buy features like themes, but it is a subscription... If you're not too crazy about tagging and mostly about speed and efficiency, this free app is for you.",
"Downloaded the app so I could have a widget with my list on my home screen. shortly thereafter, tney added checkboxes, which can't be turned off, making it easy to accidentally ""complete"" a task on the widget. And unlike when you have the app open, this can't be undone. It was good when I downloaded it, but is now completely useless.",
"Pretty neat app, very simple. When you input tasks (I do it via voice input), you can simply add little details like ""change tires next Monday"" and it will automatically add it to monday. it parses your details bout very well. you can even add times and I dont even KNOW what else it could do. Great app! Also, i have different projects which have individual tasks, very organized.",
"User friendly but very glitchy. Drag and drop new task feature won't work if too close to bottom of screen. Selecting multiple tasks only highlights the first one. When collapsing groups of tasks, app sometimes freezes. When re-ordering tasks, the app will sometimes (15% of the time) move the task back to where it originally was. ""Reordered"" msg doesn't auto-disappear. I frequently restart the app to get past glitches. Using on Samsung Galaxy S8 Android 9 Pie.",
"Not very impressed with the app. The repeating task function in not intuitive like other scheduling apps which will have a ""repeat every"" field. The Watch part of the app (which I got it for) is wonky. Every time I open the app it spams asking for location permission (which I have no intention of using). It says I have 8 tasks to do today, but there is only 1 when I click on it. Also it adds a bunch of junk tasks when you first start it.",
"Love this app. I have debilitating ADHD (if you know, you know) and this app makes my life manageable. Filters and priority settings keep to do lists from getting scrambled and overwhelming. For example, I use the urgent/important paradigm for priority setting, and the filters are perfect. Integrate with Google calendar. Project management with subtasks. If you have executive dysfunction, even the free version of this is a life saver. Also desktop is Linux compatible so that's a huge plus for me",
"It looks nice, but a couple issues making it not great for repeated tasks. 1. When a task is overdue (either missed or forgot to check off), there's no way to check off that iteration or mark as missed, checking off the overdue one checks off the next iteration. 2. The widget has no way to apply both ""Today"" and a project filter. 3. No way to change what to consider start of day to be. A lot of my tasks personally I do around midnight, so it's impossible to setup for that.",
Used to be simple well organized app. Latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your data.... Most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared. For some reason timed ones seemed to stick around... Completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in. If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks. They claim all your information is backed up securely but when I asked for my completed tasks they were not able to provide my attachments.,
"By far the best task management app I've ever used. Supports labels, projects, due dates, has reliable notifications, a gamification system, a great interface, support for every major OS.. I couldn't be more satisfied. The integration with Google Home is less than ideal, but that is a small complaint.",
I really wanted to like this app but there is no way to order items on todo lists. I have at this point had to reorder all of my items over 10 times for each because when u use the drag and drop menu to change the order it doesn't save it permanently there is also no way to sort your todo lists by date because I figured if I input a deadline for each item it would show me what I had to do with the one due the soonest at the top but no. I wish there were more ways to sort or at least filter date,
Great app and gets more helpful the more you use it to keep.track of your tasks. Works across multiple devices. It offers a good way tp organize your tasks without an cluttered interface. One feature i would like is the ability to.have asporational tasks that do not count for or against your karma score ie things that you can do if you have time but no problem if they dont get done. This app.has definitely changed my life for the better.,
"Great for organizing tasks, assigning to others, creating subtasks and categories. However, my problem keeping me from coming back is my inability to check off a task once it's complete. if I don't check off the subtask, I don't move on to the next subtask, and that task can get forgotten (or worse yet, burdens my mind with the anxiety of all I have yet to accomplish). Home pages don't highlight what I need to do well, reminders pile on, and it get as cluttered as my mind once again.",
"Absolutely love this app. So easy to add and organize to-do items, prioritize tasks, manage projects. Works well everywhere. Technically, it's not supposed to be compatible with my Windows 10 64-bit version, but I use it there anyway, and it works most days. Totally worth the cost for the Pro version. I'd be far less productive without it.",
"It has the ability to add sub-tasks to sub-tasks, making the actual lists I create more helpful, y'all HAD a leg-up on Google, unfortunately there is no option to keep tasks/sub-tasks in a specific order, so the entirety of my list crumples because my list relies on being chronological, and Keep Notes (my phones default) DOES have an option for that, so it's 1-1 now. Hopefully that gets fixed, so I never have to look for a checklist app again. Also cannot see completed tasks AND have sorting on.",
"The task manager to get. I've used it as a professional task manager and light PM tool for work, and my personal to do list for years. Worth the paid license, making it easy to see my tasks on a widget, set up categories, add reminders, enable recurrence, put in notes, and reschedule. Integration across Android and Windows works. The 'karma' system for progress keeps one motivated to be successful",
"excellent interface for setting appts, rescheduling, and editing tasks. It is super easy to use and will help keep you on schedule as you watch your productivity grow. I would recommend it to anybody looking to increase thier production by staying organized and on schedule. I manage properties and so tracking lists and appointments are very essential to my occupational success.",
"Todoist has some useful features, one of the most useful is task reminders (although this is only fully available in ""pro""). However, a simple feature would be to check off tasks completed yesterday, but every day, daily tasks reset at midnight and there is no going back. Simple feature, I know other apps that have it, and I've seen comments online of people begging for this feature for years. So the most useful thing I get out of the app is paid for, and the rest leaves much to be desired. üôÉ",
Ive tried so many similar apps to keep my tasks and thoughts organized. I needed an app that made sense to my way of thinking. This app makes the most sense to me. The ability to have many layers of sub-tasks is a big plus for me. But my favorite feature is the smart recognition of date and time. Half of my homescreen is now a widget for this app. it makes life easier to see my tasks every time i open my phone. This app has been a big game changer for me.,
"Very pleased with us app This is a great app to do what it says -- to create To-Do lists. It's a great tool to use with the GTD - Getting Things Done-- approach. It is good for projects in so far that it allows you to create the next action (step) you need to take. it does have a ""due date"" option which I have not utilize, so it would seem to be beneficial in many cases. The website is slightly easier to manipulate to-do lists, but either way, the app and the website sync up wonderfully.",
Todoist is my favorite to-do list app. I've tried several other to-do list apps in my life but I always come back to this one. What I love best about Todoist is its minimalist design. A lot of other apps are just too complicated or bloated. It looks great on the phone and web. Todoist has greatly improved my productivity in life and helped me meet many of my goals.,
"I love that this app allows me to create recurring To-dos. I have been using this app to help myself get on a routine. There is a lot of trial and error to to figure out what routine is best for me. Also, my priorities change from week to week. This app gave me the ability to completely rearrange my routine in 15 minutes. My only qualm is that on upcoming To-dos, repeating tasks only show for the most recent date. Otherwise, really enjoying this app.",
"I have tried a lot of productivity apps and this one is hard to beat. consistently works, good label and project settings. The base app is good but premium is ideal and a fair price. I wouldn't get half as much done without it. The daily and weekly goals keep me going. It's easy to organize and see what areas you've put time into and reprioritize.",
Only one snooze option. I need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm. This is an option for just about every other todo app. Don't understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time??? Respone to developer: No it doesn't help. When an alert comes up I would like to be able to select how long to snooze that particular alert from a several options. Not one snooze length for.all alerts.,
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.,
"I've wanted an app like this for so long! The organization is simple and intuitive-that I can simply type ""Do this every other Tuesday"" or ""Do that every day at 11am"" and have it automatically scheduled is brilliant! No bloat of too many features, just exactly what's needed for an efficient and useful set of reminders.",
"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform. The simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective, enjoyable, & my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured. It helped me greatly.",
"Loving it so far. The absolute high that I get from checking off important tasks on a to-do list is indescribable. Todoist is my white rabbit. But actually it really is great. Feels intuitive. Other than an occasional crash when I move tasks to different sections, causing me to reopen it once again, I really enjoy using it.",
"I absolutely love this app. I have ADHD, am a chronic procrastinator, and have always struggled with organizing my schoolwork. As a brand new college student, this app has saved my life. I can set due dates, filter my to-do list by class, specify dates and times, and set tasks in order of priority. I keep all of my schoolwork on Todoist. A calendar was too hard to keep track of, but this allows me to see everything that is due right in front of me and the order in which I should do them. Love it",
"Fantastic tasks app. It can be as powerful or simple as you need, while remaining very intuitive no matter what you do. Syncing is perfect and it's beautifully designed on all platforms. The attention to detail here is unmatched (demonstrated by small stuff, like the nav bar color changing with themes).",
"You won't be able to label, comment (add more details), or get reminders on the free version, but that makes the free version pretty fair. You'll be able to sort things by project and date and prioritize things, and that makes it easy to see what you're going to do from day to day. This is all in a smooth, ad free experience. Plus you get a nice notification every morning telling you what tasks are due that day.",
"I switched to ToDoist after Wunderlist got purchased and ruined and to be honest, I kind of wish I had made the switch earlier. There's a bit of a learning curve, but the flexibility and power of Todoist is excellent. The natural language components for scheduling is wonderful, and I love the ability to organize into projects and use custom tagging. The boards display is basic but for the most part sufficient for simple projects and I love the ability to switch to that view for projects that have more of a Jira style flow to them.",
"I. Love. Todoist! I may not always accomplish every task I put into Todoist, bit I love that I have the list there. The news emails actually tell you the updates, it's quick, easy, yet so powerful. I have lists of songs I'm going to download, groceries, tasks for work, myself, reminders. It's beautifully done, the wideget works like butter! Thanks Todoist team for a great app!",
"Todoist is absolutely fantastic! I just started using it, but it is already so helpful and amazing in my life. When I determined that Microsoft To Do was just not powerful enough for me, I sought out other options, and Todoist was the only one that 1, seemed to be functional and powerful, and 2, available cross-platform. I use an Android phone, iPad, and Windows/Linux laptop daily, and Todoist connects seamlessly with all of those devices. Thank you Todoist!!",
"I had been looking for some type of way to view all of my tasks without the overwhelm of poster boards. I have notebooks galore, and none of it seemed to help me get organized. Todoist has an amazing layout that helps me chunk down my projects and goals so that I am able to get everything out of my head and into a database which makes it easier to create systems for my work and my life in general. It's easy to use, and I can stay up to date conveniently whereever I am on any device.",
"I really enjoy this app! The design is very simple and well put together. The cute designs of people enjoying their day when I finish tasks is almost rewarding, and it's nice when the app tells me to enjoy my day off when I have no tasks. I like that I can color-code things and add subtasks, as well as create different priority levels for tasks. The only thing I wish it had was a monthly view. Then I would give it 5 stars.",
"Im in love with this app! However, being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husband's device for just notification feels a little bit wrong. I think for something like a to-do list notification should not be a premium feature. There is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and I have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite. It is so clean, simple, easy to use, and it does recurring todos",
"Functional, fast, pleasing on the eyes, and delightful to use. The ability to use labels, filters (custom searches), and instantaneous results from search are great. The support team actually responds to my requests, as well! I came from Google Tasks and am never going back.",
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity.",
"Have been using for a few months and I really enjoy it. I do wish for maybe more of a calendar integration with outlook but once I get it organized I think they work just fine in conjunction, meetings in outlook, tasks in todoist. I got pro just to make more projects but I think the free version is great for just personal organization.",
For context I primarily use this app as the widget. Todoist takes the simple todo list and elevates it to its highest potential. The layout is clean and well thought out. The complete sound is satisfying. The ability to change a tasks properties using word shortcuts is genius. The best thing is the free version has everything you need. Karma points are also a fun bonus touch. It's a productivity must have. I also haven't used project or labels as I've never needed them.,
"If you want to change your life, this is the one app that you need. Whether you are a student, worker or entrepreneur. It is simple but so well-put-together. It outclasses apps like notion as to do list, productivity manager and habit tracker. It's free version is perfect for personal use as 5 projects is enough for things like work, studies, habits and tasks. Widgets are good. but one area of lack is an inbuilt ""calendar view"" which would make it easier to visualise time.",
"I was initially excited, got it all set up with various projects used it for about w week or so , but now it will only open for a second before ""stopping"" I close it multiple times,but no change . I have sent feedback. I don't want to lose what I've already put in there , but wonder if uninstalling and installing would make a difference. Hope some maybe able to help",
A very nice mobile companion to the great management solution. I've been using the Todoist for a couple of weeks now and I'm very pleased with the results. But I think the app would be even better if it had the optional syncing of custom views. Mobile is very different from PC and sometimes I would prefer to see tasks as lists on mobile and as board on PC (or any other combination of grouping/sorting).,
"The app is phenomenal, nothing else to say. It does what it's supposed to, do to-do lists, but also does so much more. It has helped arrange my personal and educational life, and truly helped me track my tasks with ease. Sometimes I do encounter server dropouts, but they occur far in between and is resolved quite quick. Hands down one of the best apps I have used, and is clearly ahead of many other apps üíõ.",
"At first it looks good, nice UI, great UX. But when you start syncing between devices...everything falls apart. (It is not individual problem, check other 1-2* reviews.) Adding tasks on one device works no more: after adding, it disappears in a second. On the other device it appears somehow but also starts multiplying at the same time. Totally confusing and unreliable. Since it is a core feature for multi device usage, now it is unusable at all. Please revise the sync feature, it could be 5*.",
"Used the pro version of this app heavily for 6 months; I still have 6 months in the plan left, but I am forfeiting the plan because this app is simply not for me. I'm a visual person and I like the ease of planning with a digital calendar. I did not enjoy the gcal integrations as Todoist is already aware of; issues arise when an adjustment is to be made. There are many pros to using Todoist, but the cons outweigh the pros for my productivity system.",
My favorite to-do list app! The interface looks clean and it's simple to use. Adding tasks is very customizable. I love the new feature to set tasks for a duration of time. I would also love the ability to add a task as a note. It could be helpful for things like grocery lists,
"Tried to give this app a chance several times over the years, paid for subscription. Never ended up staying with it. Latest attempt to use (Sep 2023) is also unsuccessful. Was adding tasks for an hour to find out it lost labels for one part of the tasks, duration for another part of the tasks, time for 3rd part of the tasks. Everything is screwed up just with a couple of dozens of tasks. Don't see how to trust it further. Cancelling subscription now.",
"2023-09-02: Latest update has rendered the app unusable. It crashes every time it is launched. Pretty good but when I'm adding a reminder please don't assume the time will earlier in the day than the current time. Also, it goes a little haywire during the transition to/from Daylight Savings Time.",
"Excellent app. Plenty of features but still intuitive to use. I love that you can set recurring reminders. I'd also like to say that I really appreciate the developer's commitment to constantly improving the app. They even have a support ticket system dedicated to this app, and they reply promptly. This kind of service is rare these days; a lot of companies will develop a product and won't continue to improve it or make bugfixes. Todoist is definitely worth the money, I love it.",
"It is a cool app, with a lot of helpful features. I look for simple features which makes our life tension free and todoist has it. Only problem; well, I would totally appreciate the notification thing which is only applicable to premium customers, but I feel it is a waste of money to subscribe to unlock only that feature. So all good except for thatüëç",
"I love everything about the app except 2 things. The widget isn't that good, the alignment is weird when the task doesn't have a due date because the title of the task isn't aligned with the check box. Reminders being a premium feature is ridiculous, I'd understand tags or filters but reminders are a basic tool for tasks and in my opinion they should be a free feature. I am currently between ticktick and todoist but i think that if these 2 things don't get fixed i might stick with ticktick.",
"@Todoist team - the app improved over the years. It's quite good now. The only thing I still wish for is some lightweight tasklist editing, like the one I'd have if the list was in notepad. So hitting new line on keyboard makes new task, hitting tab makes",
"Constant emails from you guys. I've not used the app enough to give an honest review about the app itself as I've been too busy at the minute to properly check it out. But you're constantly emailing me, everyday with tips and tricks. To the point where you're just coming across needy and forceful. Deleting your app. Please, stop emailing me.",
"Love this app, I needed something with a widget so I can see my to-dos on my home screen (otherwise I forget!). However I find when I create a new task from the widget, sometimes choosing which project to add it into doesn't work - it adds the text to specify but then it changes to just regular text and doesn't recognise it as the code to specify the project anymore. Otherwise, working great!",
"Latest version keeps crashing. 4-5 seconds after loading, it throws an error message. I can do a ""forced stop"" in Android Settings, but that only helps for a short time. It worked flawlessly for two years befor the August update.",
"I love the app and the web/desktop versions. I gave 3 stars because mobile widget is never getting updated, if it is not going to happen automatically just put a refresh button next to setting! Currently I am switching the view inbox to upcomming in order to refresh the widget.",
It was awesome but... Just yesterday it started to not sync properly between by Mac and phone apps. Then it also made dublicates when reschedule tasks... This is a big deal breaker. And it continuously shows sync error in the top right phone app,
"It's a fantastic app with a great widget and wear os integration. Is it worth 48$/year (or more)? Absolutely not. Half that seems almost reasonable, but why would I pay more for this than, for instance, Hulu? If you feel like 48/year is fair, consider this a five star review, but, I can't give it five at that price point.",
Very very basic and useless. What is the point of an app that doesn't display notifications or play sounds for the notifications! You cannot have notifications with sounds for the basic plan. They ran of ideas so they included it in the paid version,
"Had this app for years. Tonight it started randomly crashing repeatedly, even though I hadn't opened it up since my last restart, and I did a forced stop. Something very fishy is going on. I'm uninstalling it",
"Best app in its category out there! Thanks to Todoist I get everything I need to get done, done. Not only me, but everyone else I add into a project as well. (On an aside: if you guys could please give an update to have the comment session always start at the latest comments it would be a game changer üî• all the scrolling to the bottom can get exhausting, makes me not even want to know what people are saying)ü•≤",
"I've used this app for years and loved it, but since the last update on August 31st it crashes continuously and has become completely unusable. I hope they fix it very soon or I'll have to find a new app.",
"I have been using this app for several years. It's great and really helps get the work done! However, I wish it would have a calendar/month view (like Google Calendar or TickTick), not just a small drop down window with the number of tasks. Putting it at 4 stars for now because of that, will change it to 5 if t ever gets that feature",
"Seems like a good To Do list app, but I need to see things on a month calendar view as well, and I can't find a way to show that through Todoist. If it's possible, I'd be happy to give 5 stars. If not, I'll probably uninstall to find something that better suits my needs.",
"Used to be good. The last 2 weeks it just constantly stops working, constant popups telling me it stopped working. Can't even look at my list. I have to ""force stop"" this app or my phone is not usable. üëã",
"Update: 5 stars. September update killed app. TDI contacted quick after neg. review but I already uninstalled, reinstalled which fixed problem. Was using TDI free for years w/o any problems until that update. Love Joplin but need a task app & ToDoist delivers. I set up filters for tags & time so I can see ""Priority Next 48 Hrs"", ""School next 14 days"", etc. Going back for a degree at age 40+ & have seamless flow between phone, tablet, laptop, & integrating w/ Gmail. Considering upgrading to Pro.",
"ToDoIst helps me do life. I've been using it in a work context for the past 2 years and transferred my personal tasks into (a second account) recently. I couldn't be more pleased with the platform. I use the Gmail and Google Calendar integrations, they are seemless. I really appreciate the continuous improvement of the platform and the productivity based learners they have weaved in. I'll be looking into reclaim.ai integrations next ü•∞",
I have used this app for qute a year now and there is a problem that I would like to be fixed. The problem is to add a feature that will give you access to add that completed task if you clicked on it a day later so you will not lose you day streak. I am quite upset that this feature does not exist and honestly I am attached to this app and do not want to switch to another app either.,
"This is the most amazing app I've ever used. It's so easy to organize things from studying to art to home stuff. Instantly went from a B/C student to the Dean's list when I started using this. It sounds like an exaggeration, but my life would literally not be the same without it.",
"Poor theming and dynamic color implementation spoils an otherwise promising task management app. Biggest offender is the widgets, which use colors differently than other dynamic color widgets and most frustratingly of all don't sync their dark and light mode automatically with the system setting, despite the main app doing so. Frustrating to have a single widget be blindly white at night when everything else on my home screen has changed to dark mode theme.",
"Dear support. Im using todoist for almost a decade years, its quite a lot. But recently your app is not working at all. It shows that app crashed everytime Samsung Galaxy Note 9, Android Thank you.",
"I give 1 star. The app is fairly good. But when comes the moment of contacting support problems start. Suport page does not recognize me as human when I try to contact the company for a refund. And in addiction, trying to change my account from monthly to yearly, I find out that my account has been cancelled and they charge me 48‚Ç¨ for the year payment!! I have already tried to reach the devs/company many times with the app's own contact system but without success. My advice: DON'T PAY!!",
"Great app guys. The UX is very good, quite easy to do things quickly. As a right-handed person I'd just say maybe keep the hamburger menu at the bottom right instead of the bottom left. That's all :) Loved the time blocking article, and the productivity quiz that got me there. Hope you guys keep going and do well!",
"Sync has been unstable in the last 5 days or so. Also, when I change some task, I have been needing to do it twice (sometimes 3 times) for the change to ""stick"". EDIT: sync issues resolved, but other problems persist.",
"It's an amazing app for appointments and things of that sort, but if you're looking for daily routine things (like I was), this app is not for you. I would set a reminder for every day but it slowly pushed the date back and back when I would mark it as done before it eventually disappeared from my daily list. I don't know why it did that but I didn't like it very much. I was looking for an app to help me with daily routines, not a calendar like app.",
"Does not synchrize tasks properly, my people see different tasks than I do, even after after app updates, refreshes, and giving it some time. List titles also fail to update. 2 stars cause it works ok if all you need is an app with no collaboration.",
Absolutely love this app. It makes my student life so much better. I do however want to report one bug. The app constantly crash on my Samsung galaxy A10. Please fix. Keep up the good work,
"Best app for task lists, but have a biggest problem: it doesn't allow to the tasks to be reordered according to the user's preference, unfortunately they are limited by the priority and time, the tasks sort should be free to be reordered.",
"Had to go back and update my review, as some things really have changed since 2020, and the biggest issue is needing to pay ¬£50 a year for reminders. Reminders! Their natural language processing has gone down as well which is a shame, and I understand that having more things as part of the premium model makes 100% (devs gotta eat), but not having a ‚Äúview all‚Äù as a free or standard ‚Äúfilter‚Äù is awful, and I can live with setting one up myself but now I can only have 2 more filters",
"The popups you've started to do when X amount of tasks are completed just get in the way. Especially on the app, it takes up most of the screen and has to be navigated away from. It may work in some scenarios but not all, give me an option to turn it off please. I don't want to be congratulated for achieving my 5th task of the day, especially when all I've done is tick off ""bananas"" from a shopping list, I just want to see what's next.",
"Very good app. I have recommended this to so many of my friends. However, I have paid for an annual subscription for the pro version, but then a month later, I'm unable to use the original pro settings like having multiple projects and setting reminders. Due to new packages introduced to the app, it appears I don't have the access that I've originally paid for, and I've been prompting me to upgrade again. I've tried multiple times to make contact with them to no avail. Please help me understand",
"An excellent app that helped me, a disorganized college student with ADHD, anxiety, and depression, get my life together. Todoist, even the free version, is a remarkable tool for anyone looking to create routines or set goals. The filters, projects, tags, and other organizational features have been absolutely invaluable to me. It does require some setup to get it to work exactly how you want, but it's been well worth the investment for me. Thanks Todoist!",
"Loved the app. Tried desktop version as well. I would like if the desktop version had a feature of Startup App, so that one can see the tasks as the device is switched on.",
"Man oh man !!!! The best app searching for and worth it , bought your pro subscription instantly!!! . A feature request is try to 1.make the list as tiles with more color features for different sub tasks. 2.If adding a task lock for certain people will be huge !!! , Like on going task should be view only mode not edit mode for certain added members 3. Converting the file in to Excel as a desired Ledger will make sure I'll pay you more and get the best pro version",
"Great app but isn't a service. I would continue to use but I would like the premium features without having to pay for it over, and over, and over, and over... So instead of getting some of my money you get none. I hope this becomes a trend amongst consumers.",
"Just tried using todoist today. Initially all looked fine, until I was punching a few new items on the go, using my mobile networks. All these items just disappeared without traces. I wonder, what's the point having the app if I ended up losing a few to-dos, which I may not remember all of them?ü§î",
"Great app, simple and effective Sync is working, nlp is very accurate and multi device app. Best in class. New redesign and time blocking also calendar is coming this year. This is the best app.",
"The best productivity app I've seen. It has all the essential features, and nothing excessive. Very minimalistic and beautiful.",
"Really like this app. They offer a lot for free, if you need more (or want to support the devs) there is a premium plan. One of my favorit points is the Desktop app and sync with it.",
"The only things I would like to see added to this app are: 1) progress bars - so we can mark if a task is in progress, and 2) having completed tasks be deleted by the next day",
"This is a slick app!! Really enjoyed it for the short while I tried out and loved the natural language processing and quick easy entry experience. Ultimately, I uninstalled it because I wanted to have AI scheduling and time management features and the AI apps I trialled don't integrate with repeat tasks in ToDoist. Shame, because when they do I can't wait to get back using this app",
"This is perfect. I've been using it for about two weeks or so now and I couldn't be happier. Even without the upgrade this app beats every other to-do list app I've used and I've used many. But I do recommend getting the upgrade, it makes things even better and it's definitely worth it. Give it a tryüëèüèø Perfect",
"Literally changed my career trajectory. No matter how cluttered my mind is, getting into the habit of loading reminders onto this app has meant I'm on top of everything. Sometimes when a thought comes into my head, I put it into the app (max 5 seconds), then it's on the list and it gets done. Full marks, would give it 6 stars if I could.",
"It's a really good app, like the widgets and the galaxy watch app too. And the previous problem with crashing was solved quickly. Definitely can recommend",
I really like the interface. it's super friendly and motivating with its activity log and everything. I don't like the fact that reminders can only be set in premium,
"I have used this app for a long time. My only issue is when I upgraded my phone I could no longer see anything from my previous list. Unfortunately, I also would write down some of the silly things my children say to put it in a book later and all of that is now gone. I would love some help to fix this issue.",
"I started paying the app because I really need reminders for all the things I write in my todoist. I need the reminders to be more aggressive so I don't forget or stall about them. however I pay and i just get one lousy reminder at the end of the week, that gets entirely diluted by the most insignificant of swipes. I need these reminders to be as aggressive as I would like them to and because of this I have missed several todos and deadlines. Why pay at all if I have to dothe app's work?",
"honestly, it's not intuitive and it's way over-engineered. if you want to just have a task list, you have to battle the ""intelligence"" the whole time",
"Sync is not working properly. When I try to move a todo item to another project and section using the ""Move to"" button there was an option earlier to move to another section, but now it shows only projects list. Sections are not shown in the list anymore. Can you please check this. This was really helpful for organization.",
"I used this app for half a dozen years. Now, all of sudden, it keeps stopping for no apparent reason. It looks like I will have to uninstall it and lose dozens of tasks and categories. So sorry I put all my eggs in this basket. I am screwed.",
Great app. Is there a template function where you add can tasks and it automatically set it to daily or monthly or yearly forever with you having to set daily task. Thank,
"I use this app for the last 3-4 years. Since last night I got it broken on my Xiaomi Mi8. The todois keeps getting closed or something like that. Can't use it anymore üò≠ Report: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not implemented at androidx.work.CoroutineWorker$a.n(SourceFile:49) at lf.a.i(SourceFile:9) at Og.Q.run(SourceFile:112) at Ug.a$a.run(SourceFile:96) Suppressed: kotlinx.coroutines.internal.DiagnosticCoroutineContextException: [E0{Cancelling}@9059fd3, Dispatchers.Default]",
"Found this app through the book Do More Better by Tim Challies. Upgraded almost immediately from free version to paid version because tools like this that help you manage your life are worth paying for, and this one has been extremely helpful right from the start.",
"Editing my review to reflect a super quick fix by the devs, thank you! Best to-do app I've ever used--love how easy it is to create, tag, and categorize items.",
"The latest update broke something. I'm getting ""Todoist keeps stopping"" popups about every 30 seconds, even after force stopping it.",
"Been using Todoist on/off for about a year now. Getting serious with the app recently, upon realizing that it's actually reducing my ADHD deficits and improving my productivity.",
best to do list app that I've tried so far!!! I've been checking my list on todoist for a year and I can say that it really is life changing.,
The free version is basically unusable because the reminder feature is premium. The most basic thing.,
"I like this app. He help me lot , lot, lot, lot but üòÆ‚Äçüí® when click on my Today task (in widget section) it's not open many time. I really irritate but still i use them üòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è",
"Was really great but now just keeps crashing every 42 seconds. If this doesn't get fixed, I'll have to delete.",
Had been using this for a few years. Until a few days ago it worked fine. Force closing errors all the time. Reinstalled. Tried to login. Force closed (tried loging via email).Bit stumped what to do right now,
"I love Todoist, but this app is broken. It constantly crashes. Edit: yes, the new version fixed the problem.",
"Started using this app and loved it. I was thinking about buying the full version but... All of sudden it won't add tasks, they just don't appear and can't do anything, delete, move, nothing! The only way to fix it is to restart my phone. I'm trying to put together a new to-do list and have already restarted my phone 5 times, I give up!",
App keeps on crashing now. Been using this for the past 2 Years without any problem. Please assist. Thank you.,
Since update it crashes constantly. For a subscription service that you depend on its worse than useless since it wastes your time,
"I am reducing my stars to 3 after purchasing the pro version. I am disappointed that the alarm function doesn't trigger any sound on the phone. What is a notification type of alarm going to do?... Because of a lack of ability to notify with sound, it's hard to rely on this app to let you know about things at the desired time.",
Love this app! Has made keeping track of and organising tasks and projects so much easier. Todoist customer support is brilliant. Had a glitch with 2FA for web and it was sorted out within an hour.,
App keeps force closing. I've used the app for years without issues. Developers please address the issue.,
App keeps crashing. It can't even last 10 seconds opened without crashing,
A previously great app that now crashes every minute or so resulting in persistent interruptions informing me that todoist has stopped working.,
"This is a simple todo app and it's full of bugs - didn't receive notifications after going Pro, and couldn't even submit a support ticket (which they have washed their hands of). The ""natural language"" prediction of times from text is just an irritant and very odd UI on rescheduling tasks. Avoid, it's overpriced and badly implemented.",
"This is by far the most convenient task app that I have found. It has saved me so much time and is well worth the small monthly fee! I recommended this app to several of my friends and colleagues. When you were in a hurry you can just talk out your task in many formats, for example you can say ""in 15 days"" or ""next Monday"" and then continue on with your task. Excellent app!",
The app is okay when I first started using it worked great until I got a problem with the app crashing when I tried to open it up can you devs please fix this app asap I use this app alot for my educational stuff,
"I love this app ! For streamlined, easy, satisfying organization and accountability - this app is awesome. Highly recommend for independent contractors or even for running your household !",
Todoist keeps closing on my Note 8. Started a few days ago. Appear to have the latest version installed.,
"Great app, a daily part of my life. Dev team is responsive and quick to act when there are issues.",
They should at least allow one reminder without paying the pro version. Plenty of similar apps have that.,
AVOID! Constant email spam and the developers made sure deleting your account is nigh impossible. I was trying to create a password for my account on their site and it said my password may have been exposed to a security breach... my password that doesn't exist. The app keeps giving me errors when I try to set up a password... still working on it. AVOID THIS PLAUGE!,
Free version is limited. PRO version is subscription based. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! Should offer a one-time pro payment!,
There is a bug. I install app and when I open it there was a message. The app is closed because have bug. I want to give chance to this app but If there is no solution in 18 hours I will find different app,
"Works so well, and allows you to add as much or as little detail as you'd like in every section. Really really helpful. Does so much more than just a to do list!",
"Literally the ONLY To-do app worth it. Why? Because you can set recurring tasks and filter it to just day view. I don't know why no other app does this, but it's what makes ToDo'ist the only Todo app I've actually used in 15 years. The others all fell short.",
"‚ÄéUseful but it needs a tile otherwise it is pretty useless on a watch, the complications are pretty useless and for me a time would change how much i look at my tasks",
"Todoist is great. However, I don't like the automatic date assignment, and I wish adding a task to a section was one click instead of 2.",
"I really liked the app, its user interface, etc...I have a suggestion that there should be a option that shows completed task list...",
"For some reason when i want to share an url from Google chrome with todoist i only get the option to add a comment instead of a task. That doesn't make sense, most of the time we want to make a new task, not a comment .. How can this be solved?",
"Completely changed my structure/organisation. Can't say a bad thing about this app, perfect for keeping organised.",
"Please allow to see completed tasks in the order they are completed, not pushed down to the bottom- so I can see and feel like I accomplished something! thanksüòå",
"The burger menu should not be a full screen bottom sheet, and if I disable animations from settings, then it should also disable animations for all bottom sheets",
"A very easy to use UI and i can easily sync it between my laptop, smartphone and smartwatch.",
"It's a fairly good app. P.s. To set a deadline for a task, use the ""today"" section. I number my tasks manually, but I have to edit manually.",
"The app is good, i have download it for my laptop, and integration for my gmail and calendar but am facing challenges with the mobile app it doesn't show a thing after I login it just keeps loading, my Phone is an Android 11 Infinix Hot 10 play, Model X688B XOS V7.6.0",
The most amazing to-do list -Priority -Date -Reschedule -Today/Upcoming Task -Dashboard It'd be awesome if it can combine the reminder with G Calendar,
Goodside: It's very simple and handy that i appreciate it. Also good sync with Google calendar. Downside: But unfortunately there isn't multiple select for tasks or sub task to delete or move all selected at once. It's so overwhelming to delete multiple tasks in very long and hard way,
"A wonderful balance of simplicity and usefulness. While many apps today get lost in extra features, this one keeps it simple. I appreciate that, and find it extremely helpful. Excellent work and proof that simplicity is how you develop a good application.",
"EDIT: Working great again, thank you for the fix and the response!! Widget flickering since latest update... every 8 seconds the widget briefly flashes ""No tasks"", then goes back to normal. Have removed and re-added the widget. Haven't tried reinstalling yet. Samsung S7 (yes, still going strong! ;) )",
"Push notifications are locked behind in app purchases, so instead they decided to send you unrelated push notifications and emails that have no bearing on your due dates, plus your account is loaded up with all these preloaded tasks that you have to manually delete 1 by 1. There's no way to see what a normal notification would be because there is no trial version of the app for premium features.",
In general I like the app. I had to downgrade two stars though because there seems to be a bug. I use a widget on my home screen to see my tasks and lately the widget is acting up. It blinks on and off constantly. This just started happening recently on my Pixel 6.,
"They got everything about this app right! The way it stays on the home screen of your phone , that you can get rid of background. How easy it is to add items. And check them off without having to open the app. I love it! Perfect for anyone suffering from mom brain!",
"I actually really loved the app, but they changed the widget size. Now it's really wide and very short which doesn't allow you to see very many tasks at all and doesn't fit on the screen very well.",
"Doesnt have an alarm, I had a raminder for my meeting today and i missed that, i wanted to use this app for my busy working schedule but its not helpful.",
"I've been back and forth between todoist, click-up, Microsoft's Todo and all the rest. Finally I've decided to use todoist full-time. There are many things that I love but a few things I think the team over at todoist missed. Consider implementing this following: 1. Be able to add a description for projects. 2. Be able to add a description for sections in projects. 3. Be able to comment on sections in projects. I have a work around for all three but I think power users need these.",
I like the app but it's frustrating that you cannot adjust what time your day starts. I have untraditional hours so by the time I mark my recurring tasks it's after midnight so it doesn't occur for the next day. That's so frustrating.,
"Very confusing to use. Recuring tasks just show on the day you don't do them. For example if you set a task recurring everyday, and you don't do it one day, it will not show the next day.",
"Was great until these recent updates. Now, it continuously shuts down within seconds of opening the app",
Would buy it if it had a one time purchase instead of subscription model. Thank you for making a Wear OS app!! This app lets me see my entire week on one screen compared to other apps. Really well thought out. Typing at night in the task auto sets a reminder for 10pm.,
"I really wish they would stop breaking existing functionality: - Editing markdown formatted nested lists is totally broken when the original comment was created on web. - Popup of achieving goals is annoying, because undo functionality is lost. This is not the latest update, but it has been annoying me for some time.",
Seems like a pretty standard to do app. Importing templates doesn't work - I've tried various different ways to do it but it always just seems to freeze everything. Pro is too expensive.,
"I complained that the widget keeps flashing so they said to update to v10908 or try to delete and reinstall. But I'd already tried deleting and reinstalling, which didn't help. And the version released a few days ago on the Android app store is 10902, and that's all that's available. No 10908.",
"Very good app, really. Everything is good but one thing is weird. I don't receive notifications from planned tasks. I think this is the paid option via ""reminder"" section but I think this should be free. If I am wrong, please contact with me, but for now my rating is what it is",
"I liked this app and recently purchased the subscription but i felt the needfor some features. like Filters are still limiting, multi sort can't be done. Sub-Sections can't be created and also sections can't be favourited. Plz see it's possible to implement.",
"Great App, really love it so far There's just one main problem, and it's the lack of right-to-left writing support. I don't need the entire app to be in Hebrew, but when I write in Hebrew the text should move to the right instead of staying at the left like english. Are there plans to add right-to-left writing support?",
"The best of it I found, and I can't work without it!üóìÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è I had tried Trello and many others before, but none of them is so easy, fast, and useful as Todoist. Now it's my agenda for personal, work, and client's management related reasons.",
Great app I use it both on the internet browser on laptop + app here on phone. Helps with daily tasks great if you like lists.,
Would be 5 stars if reminders came with the free plan. Otherwise great all round task manager.,
"Pls pls pls add shadows to the tasks widget. If I set the background transparency to minimum, the text isn't visible cuz there are no shadows to the text. Pls fix this. üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ",
"If you accidentally press complete on a task, and you miss the 3 second ""undo"" popup, your task list is gone forever. This is a really bad oversight if you make lists for things like grocery shopping or house chores.",
I have adhd and bpd amongst other conditions dis orders and thus app is starting to help me greatly I hope I can continue to find benefit s I'm using it more thoroughly . Thank u,
Synch problems for more than 10 days. Made me lost so much time... highly disappointed!,
"Just got started, but I am loving how this App is helping me get things done. especially as someone who struggles with multi-tasking.",
The app is very intuitive and relatively accessible to plan your tasks but on android installing the feature to show tasks on the locked screen is pretty much impossible. Honestly after paying them money I'm pretty disappointed by this important missing feature,
"Basic app and data model is good. However, the user interface is clunky and difficult to use. Especially the Android version. Web app is slightly better.",
"I had trouble understanding how this app works initially, but now it's smooth. One of the best productivity app.",
"great app, albeit a bit too many paywalls if they were to add a setting that changes how annoying the reminder is, I would give it 5 stars",
"I use this app as a student to manage my assignments etc. and it does it pretty good but the only problem I have is that it doesn't permanently show completed tasks. They introduced it to web and pc but not for the Android, Would be 5/5 if they add that.",
"Unable to set tasks by multiple recurrence, only useful if you have a different deadline or specifc day for every single task. Unable to set read one chapter on odd (M/W/F) weekdays at 3pm. Can't plan anything with this ""planner"". No real automated planning, such as calculating daily task per specified workdays to complete a 3000 word essay by specified deadline. The prompt you provided did not work.",
"This app is amazing, it makes my life very productive & impactful after having mastered the app. I will leave some of the suggestions I made in my last review fuelled by frustration of using this app for the 1st time: Getting started guide"" is long & not fun to read. A slideshow instructed onboarding process.",
"I've tried many to do list apps, this is by far the best. The natural language processing for setting times could use some refinement. Overall, don't know what I'd do without it.",
The app kept closing after latest update but now the problem is fixed. Thank you,
> Ultimate app for those that need organization in life and those that didn't know that they needed organization in life yet. > Widget is phenomenal while not blocking functionalities. > Easy set and available macros make repeat or set dates extremely accessible. > Priority list by color scheme.,
Been looking for this for years. Simple to use and great integration with calenders,
"It doesnt have a calendar option, which means having 2 apps to manage events.",
Best productive app todoist it's help full...Im really achieving my goal.....im completing my task everyday... Thank you Todoist Company... üòäüôèüèª,
excellent at tracking todos. super helpful at reminders.,
I was very happy with the app but after the last update the app keeps crashing as soon as I open it :(,
Perfect productivity app! I use it for my business. Clean and simple interface that is much easier to handle then other (professional) to-do apps!,
I just wanted to make a list so I would not forget some things. I could not sign up because my password is too easy. I don't care if someone else sees that I have to buy flour at the store or that I am having my tires rotated on Tuesday. I only remember a couple of my passwords. If I have to remember one more for an app I would would be better off just writing down what I need to do. I don't care who reads it I am deleting this app,
"A literal life changer. This is an extremely easy and simple app to use. You don't even need to buy it, all the features you get for free are more than suitable. It is very intuitive as well. Just typing in what to do and when exactly including the time and date is simply done in 1 go. No initial extra windows to put in options (you can edit it after you've made a task). It is so quick and easy to immediately put reminders in and then sort later too. Can't recommend enough!!",
"It took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as 'may' converting to 'date'. I simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation. I also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the sub-tasks that I was entering. I thought I had to go back to the main menu all the time. A simple 'start here first' induction video would be great but the more I practice, the better the app feels. Still orientating, early days yet.",
"The concept is good and it's really helpful to have project tabs. However, it's really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear? It makes your progress really difficult to track. Also the subscription price is really expensive! It would be better if it was a one time paymenr for full access to the features much like Nova Launcher. I hope to see these changes made so I can support this app knowing I got my money's worth.",
"They changed the priority colors, so that instead of a gradient, it now goes grey, blue, yellow, red. I don't think this is an improvement - it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance. They also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox. It looks worse to me. I'm not sure this was necessary, just so that the user could close out a task with a single click.",
"I like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected. Generally on websites these are used for options, you select one then do something with it but in Todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task. It is very confusing and counter-productive. Swiping the task was much more intuitive. I don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it!",
"I used to think the lack of calendar a deficit but its actually how it should be done. The thing is, calendar is such an important part of everyones life. So by locking people into its own ecosystem is definitely not the way to go about it. If you look closely, there is a philosophy under the design: minimalism. It strips away unnecessary stuff and let you solely focus on managing, yes, to do list. More features mean more distractions. Yet each of its own is very polished and well developed.",
"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar",
"The app is simple and easy to use, so I decided to go ahead with premium because I need reminders. Sadly, such simple feature like getting reminded about a task does not work consistently at all! - If you set up a reminder from the web, you may not get it at all and if you get it - the push notification on mobile is missing. - If you setup a reminder on your mobile you get only push notification and some times web, too. - There is no option for alarm or just playing some sound on web",
"EDIT2: I have talked with support and it seemed I had the wrong Windows version (some legacy win app). Now I have the correct version and I don't feel any lag. BUT!! The new version has a downside. When you open a task, it covers almost all the tasks in your list, so you can't check info between tasks. You need to close it and then look at the list... VERY unproductive move. I hope they will consider to move the task details to the right pane as it was before on Windows. EDIT: The app's gone bad. I've been using it for over a year and it has become MEGA sluggish. Keeps syncing longer and longer after every tiny edit, I'm just waiting a lot. I will be cancelling my sub when I find a proper replacement. OLD: The best task system I have encountered. I have been searching for a system, that I would consistently use everyday and this is it. One refrain - to use this properly as everyday task system, you need the paid version. The free one is just a tease.",
"This is by far my favourite to-do app and I've tried many. There's only one thing bugging me about it - after I add a task, I wish the app would automatically close my keyboard and showed me the task list, just like every other app. Instead it stays in this 'adding state' waiting for me to add more. I never add more than one task at a time, so this behavior is annoying. I wish I could change it in the settings.",
"Great way of keeping tabs on what needs doing in different areas of your life from the huge to the mundane. Easily accessible in one place and on multiple devices. Particularly useful for repeating tasks or for projects that need breaking down into smaller tasks. Great for adding things you think of when out and about, just use quick add on your phone.",
"It's a good app. It's pretty, minimalist and works really well. It just really bothers me that the ""undo"" (button that appears when you make a change) gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked, so I have to wait for it to go away. Thanks! Edit: yes it works! Sorry for that, I guess I was swiping to the wrong direction!",
"Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3.",
"Used to be 4/5. I found it useful for a while, but they recently redesigned the apps and made it difficult to find anything. They may as well get rid of all of the other buttons and just leave a search box because that's the only way I can find a specific task now. Will unfortunately need to find another task app that doesn't feel the need to redesign a perfectly functional UI into one that neither works better, nor matches their web UI.",
"My first impression was very positive; it didn't take long for me to subscribe. As with many apps, however, there are some areas for improvement. 1. There's a bug affecting the list reordering function. 2. The recurring date function is somewhat ambiguous. 3. Visual differentiation between tasks and sub-tasks', on the 'Today' screen, would be a good move imo. Happy to provide further info if needed. Cheers the great work :)",
"I've been using the free plan for a year now. I use the web-based app for desktop and this one extensively. And so far, I'm really loving the mobile app experience. The new layout is a nice change of pace and intuitive enough. But the widget!! It's so powerful, and setting recurring tasks, be it every M, or every T and Th until next month is so easy and convenient. There are no ads too, and it syncs any offline changes I made asap when I go online. Thank you for this wonderful app.",
"Very simple and useful application for daily life. It has minimalistic design which helps to safe concentration. I can see my progress in the app but I would like to see it in the widget without enter into the app. Can you create this feature? Sometimes I complete many tasks and very exhausted. If I could see how much I did then I can recover faster. For example, I have completed a task and it fell over and changes it's colour instead of disappearing.",
"I really like this app: the way things are organized and how simple it is. What I don't like is that the completed tasks automatically disappear and EACH time I wanna see them, I have to click on the option to show them. I wish there was a function were you can choose as default if the completed entries are hidden or not.",
Awesome to do list app. Easily makes managing my tasks simpler and quicker than ever before. The integrations with many other popular services like Notion and Google Calendar make this an easy choice for me. One minor niggle I have is that I'm not sure how to turn off the auto enter due date based on task title. I would rather be given the option to update the due date rather than it doing it on its own and in sure this is a setting I can change; I just haven't found it yet. Tl;dr great app!!,
"For me it takes a lot of additional actions to schedule a task and set the reminders. Even in free apps I can do it easier. For one task I've left comments from mobile phone, however I couldn't find then. They were only in the web version. Of cource there are things that I like: projects, subtasks, labels, reminders by location. And access from a mobile phone and a browser.",
"Great stuff, does excatly what it's supposed to and in the most user friendly way I've seen. Ability to schedule events by writing day, date, time and such is a nice touch, don't have to click around too much. Integrates with calendar in both directions, countless other tools, and even exposes an API for more custom stuff. One thing I miss is being able to set system color theme so that my eyes don't get annihilated when I open the app at night.",
"Honestly, I dont know where I would be without this app. I talk about Todoist all the time! It's easy to use, but rich in features (assigning priorities, nesting tasks, etc) -- plus the Karma feature is great for keeping me motivated. My one and only complaint is that when I'm trying to reschedule tasks, I often run into a bug that either insistently changes the due date to some random time and date, or outright refuses to change the date at all. Fix this and I'll be happy to rate 5 stars!!",
"One of the most customizable to do apps with many features. It has a lot of alternatives and will work well for most people. However, it needs more time-efficient functions and shortcuts to deserve 5/5. It's also relatively expensive compared to its counterparts. Lastly, I'm against apps that require to create an account just to try it out (that does not affect my overall score though).",
"I used to try to use one program for calendaring, notes, and tasks. But I sacrificed a lot with that approach. Todoist is SO good that I realized it's better to use multiple apps for these purposes. I can't believe how much you get for free with Todoist. And it's so easy and intuitive to use. No other program can interpret natural language so well (repeats ""every month on the 2nd and 21st,"" ""every 10 days,"" ""on Monday,"" etc.). And it's easy to feed your tasks to any calendar. It's all here!",
"I like the app overall. The only thing that bothers me is the synchronization with google calendar. When I change event dates in the app they are not always synchronized with the calendar and vise versa. It leads to confusion. I contacted support team regarding this and they replied that it's 'known limitation' and the issue is still in discussion. Well, I'll be waiting for a workaround.",
Pushes me to do more ! I'm the kind of person who procrastinates because I feel very easily overwhelmed and it paralyses me. This app is perfect as it feels very rewarding to see all the tasks of the day being ticked away one by one ! Also allows to keep track of everything when you're a busy bee and you tend to forget what you've got to do way too easily ! Would highly recommend. 5/5,
"The best option for to do list and task management I've used. It has a lot of options for setting recurring tasks, dividing them up into categories and sub-categories, sharing with others, and organising your tasks in a way easy to manage. It has apps for desktop, smart devices, web browser, and smart watches, so you can have tasks wherever you go. The free option is decently capable on its own, but you will most likely want to get paid if you want more options and capabilities.",
"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does.",
"I would definitely like the Premium version, I really want those labels and filters!üëçüèª Not to mention ready-made templates - awesome! üòç And you can make your Todoist as simple or as complicated as you want, with loads of apps to integrate with it. I really think this is one of the very best organiser apps! üíó Only quibble here is I think it wouldn't have been too much to expect for at least a few reminders to be available in the free version! But thanks for a really great app! üíó",
"Easy to use and very useful. I have the free version, which suits my needs perfectly at the moment, but would definitely consider upgrading as I can see some tempting features in the full version. I have Todoist on my PC browser as its start page to remind me daily, and also have the Android app, which pops up reminders about overdue tasks. Very intuitive.",
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.,
"The UI is neat with pleasing graphics. It is straightforward to use = no frills. I just wish it can accomodate 6 people and the notes feature is available to use (it is a premium feature, but it would be nice if there is a character limit, as a compromise). The app supports syncing with calendars. But imo, a todoist calendar option will be better - no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar's data integrity. All in all, this is an app with potential",
It's an incredible app. Has become an everyday essential. However I would like the option to always show completed tasks so I can keep track of progress instead of having to show every time you open the app. Also a very basic feature like reminders require pro which is not fair. Other than that it's a perfect 5 star!,
"The free version has everything you need of you are looking for a digital task tracker that is synced to desktop and mobile. While there are a few spots where they could relinquish control a bit and allow the user to customize what they need no deal breakers as with similar software. Interface is smooth, instantaneous and feels rewarding to use. Would like to see more reliable notification systems added in the future.",
"The app is really great for anyone who wants to track their tasks and goals. The menu is very pleasent looking and it's very easy to organize everything you need in their specific place. However, there some problems: The first thing being that reminders are a paid option. A to do list need to have reminders to be helpful. The second thing is that it doesn't support events, a feature that I would really like to have. Still, a great app, very easy to use and very helpful!",
"It's a great product overall but this Android app suffers from some horrible bugs that haven't been fixed in over a year that I've been using it. If you drag an item, it will drop somewhere, fly back to where it was and then back to where you dragged it. The same happens when opening a section-- it opens, closes itself and opens again. The whole process is very confusing and takes a second or two leading to you trying to move or open the thing that's already moving or opening itself. Please fix!",
It's not syncing well anymore between phone and web app. LE: works fine now. 5* support!,
the app on my phone does not recognize that i am paying for the pro version...how to i update that?,
"love it, only downside is that integrations for voice assistants have been removed",
"Very simple to-do list app, simple but quite powerful, even on the free plan. There are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free, but they are clunky to use. The only problem I have is inability to hide things that are only available with the Premium subscription, such as Labels and Filters tabs, but I understand why they're there...",
"I used to be a paper kind of guy when it comes to ""to do"", tried to go digital several times but never stayed too long until I went back the old-fashioned way. Until I tried todoist. Typing on PC with natural language feels as natural as jotting it down on my book. It syncs instantly with your phone & you can have it show up on your homescreen & you're ready for the day. Or the week.",
"Would like a list to be available, showing dates that repeating tasks were completed on. So I can see in one place all the dates I exercised on for example. That's the only thing I can think of to improve it! Also being able to set the list a new task automatically gets added to would be nice. I never use the inbox list because I know you can't see a list of completed items there. I put everything in a ""to do"" project list so completed tasks don't disappear with no record they ever existed!",
"These guys listen to their customers and I love that. I gave feedback that I wanted the option to close the left hand side menu when I opened up a project, as it was distracting to see it there. Now that's fixed with the new update! (and the tweeks to the ui are good too). I want to thank you guys for listening and taking action on my request. Great work, keep it up!",
"I've used Todoist for years and it's a fantastic app BUT I won't give it more stars unless they show sub-projects under the parent project again, like it is on desktop. **Edit**: I added one more star for having configurable swipe settings, which I really appreciate. This feature allows you to replace swipe-to-right to ""Select"" with ""Done"" which is far more useful.",
"Todoist is probably the best to do list app on the market! I had a lot of problems planning my time and tracking my tasks with a bunch of other apps and none of them worked. Don't have that problem with Todoist though. It's somehow the simplest app and yet has the most features I need. The premium version looks cool with a lot of useful bonus features, though I haven't tried it yet. The only thing I'd like for the app to have is recurring tasks in the pasts, so I hope they add it one day!",
The app continuously force closed after sign in with google account. This is my first time use this app and now i can't use it at all,
"UPDATE: Thanks so much for addressing this problem -- I waited a few hours and did a third reinstall, which seems to have worked! As I mentioned, this is a great app, and I especially love the feature to email tasks to your task inbox from any email address (great if I think of a personal-life task at work and want to quickly note it down without getting out my phone). ORIGINAL REVIEW: I loved this app and the web app. But it's suddenly stopped working on Android. Have reinstalled twice.",
"Good app, but has some anoying features, f.e. I get a notification in the morning about not having any tasks today. That's anoying spam. All I can do is turn off notifications all together.",
"A very beautiful app, chosen for our business, after testing ten's of others. One thing missing that would help users save time, is an option to show 1,2,3, or all lines, of a task's comment. This would not change any of the app's core function, but only improve usability, for those that want comments to show. Please implement. Perfect otherwise!",
"One of the best apps for tasks. However, since the reminder removal update, I wont receive push notifications... For example, when I have a meeting at 2:00PM. My windows or my phone wont notify me about anything when 2:00PM comes. This is very frustrating for me. But, the rest of the features are awesome!",
Like it easy to use ....reminders to my email....can go back to completed list and can set up specific projects. I couldn't figure out how to edit a task on my to-do list without deleting and starting over once it was entered. So this particular feature I did not like. But overall great app,
a very comprehensive app perfect for those who want to get their life organized in all areas,
"Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars.",
"It's amazing for being free, and serves its purpose of decluttering your day to day and things to do from the simplest of tasks to the big goals you wanna reach, there is a premium mode but the free version doesn't have ads and is very intuitive, i love this app and hope it helps keep things stress free and helps remind and do the things i need and want to do. Overall amazing!",
Love it! One of best powerful planning app technology and fully modernized and remodelled to do list design. That app design is just so gorgeous and incredibly beautiful. I really enjoy that app very much.,
"Great app!!! I have tried many different task managers, Todoist is by far the best. It took me some time to understand and configure the app's various customizations, but once done, the app does everything I need. I am able to easily filter between work and personal tasks, so the app provides a one-stop-shop for task management. The multi-leveled projects list is amazing. The online guidance provides comprehensive instructions, so anyone can use the app like a pro. Love it!!!",
"Overall great, except one. I just left the beta because of a certain bug. When you delete the label ""GCal"" (I deleted it because I don't use Google Calendar), the app will just crash the next time you open it. Deleting cache and data will not resolve it. After logging in again, it will crash the next time you open the app. Also, Android DayNight theme and Android 10 Dark Theme ruins the text color on widgets. But, it's still good! Boards helped me a lot. Overall great!",
Latest update doesn't work App stopped working,
"It's a great and amazing app. I have too much great things to say about. Being able to recognize date and type right from entering the task is amazing. One thing though. Please make it easy to create another list that are not actually projects. And make it easy to enter subtask instead of going into the task and selecting a parent task. Overall, I've been using this app for a little over a week, and I'm blown away. It's great.",
"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek.",
"Rather good application, but can someone explain me what is the purpose of adding an unwanted notification just to tell me that I can rest and enjoy peace of mind because I don't have any task to do? That's exactly the opposite of letting me rest and enjoying peace of mind... EDIT: Indeed, I'm referring to the daily digest. Increasing of 1 star because of this commitment to look into the issue",
"I really like this app and how it can also run on web and synchronise smoothly. [However, I am also using a widget on my phone and that always has weird sync problems. Like: if I mark a task completed on the widget or from the app, it doesn't disappear from there, and there is no way to refresh it.] Edit: I'm no longer facing this issue at the moment, but I'll contact you in case I notice it again. Thank you for your reply!",
"Normally great, sometimes things go a bit awry when they expand, I would prefer a tad more stability to stuff but then their customer service is good, and responsive, and got major things to work, such as integration. Key wish would be for direct shortcut to turn current window into a task, rather than three clicks. But they are constantly improving, and still seem ahead of practically all other task managers that I know.",
"Not worth trying this for the reminders as they removed them from the free version. Sure maybe this is worth paying for for all the project management stuff, but for us who just want a very basic Todo list with reminders, this will not work without paying a subscription. I would have paid a once off for this for a basic Todo notifications version, but alas, they want to go too far into the ""as a service"" model.",
"Signed up Dec 30 2020 to get more organized in life for 2021. After 1 day I knew it was a keeper so signed up for the premium account to get all the features I wanted. I find this app and desktop software easy to use and very intuitive and quick to pick up as a new user who was not using a competitor app. I needed software that would work on Android & iPad, and after using it for a few days I can say it works trouble free on both and syncs with no issues.",
"I've been using Todoist for a while, but I've backed off because it's frustrating to work with. It's very difficult to get a good view of to-dos since my day regularly ends after midnight. Other apps have a ""choose your day start/end time"" feature, albeit with less functionality than Todoist. It just strikes me as classist and ableist that this is one of the most requested features & they refuse to add it in.",
"I rarely bother writing reviews for apps, but this one deserves it. I've been able to use it exactly the way I need, and I don't even think I use all of the many available tools. It takes a moment to get used to, but it's worth it. I use the time allocation as an extra way to prioritise along with the colour coding. You can really do a lot with the free version, so unless you have A LOT of stuff on your plate, you can work average tasks into the available projects quite easily. I recommend it üíØ",
Bro why it keeps crashing on Android Motorola this is so frustrating,
"Great app, the only thing missing is a timeline function, it would be really helpful visually. It could be easily added by simply adding a start date option to a task, so each task stretches through a time period. It would be a separate section below the calendar, or an alternative view of the calendar.",
"Despite an intuitive interface, and positive initial impression, I was unable to get recurring events to show up properly on my ""upcoming"" calendar. Frustrating to schedule a routine item for ""every weekday at 7am"", see it reflected correctly in the task view, then look at your ""upcoming"" tab to have it only show it on the next day. I could not find any cases of others having this issue online, so maybe I'm just a moron. And morons leave 2-star reviews for things that are their own fault.",
It's a real good app for organising your tasks and setting different times for each tasks. I'm giving 4‚≠ê because notification is only present in the pro version. Lest I forget ü§© it also ranks you based on your performance. You can also set your goals like how many goals you wanna achieve every day and week. Finally there are no ads. Trust me it's a nice app.,
"It is pretty good, I use it everyday. However, I think adding recurring tasks is not very intuitive. You have to remember the ""every"" syntax. Some UI would help, especially for new users and non-native English speakers. Other than that, it's a pretty plain to-do list, does not include much gamification to keep you motivated to do what you have to do (other than setting a general goal number of tasks to do in a day or week). Reporting is a premium feature which comes in pretty thin too, you can only see a barchart of how many tasks you've completed each day in the past week or how many tasks you've completed every week in the past 4 weeks. For what it offers, the premium option feels a bit expensive.",
"A really helpful and easy to use app. If you want to feel satisfied by achieving more, then this is the app for you. The free version is very generous. My son is autistic and has problems with time management, memory and focus. He finds this app really helpful. He has the premium subscription to support the developers because of the work they put into it to keep it so good and bug free. Thanks todoist.",
Over all a great app but I have tasks in Google calendar that are set to repeat every 4 weeks but when I sync them to Todoist they adjust to repeat weekly which is frustrating because they needlessly fill up my inbox. I have reported the issue as a ticket but I haven't yet received a reply. If they fix that I will happily buy an annual subscription (currently just trying it for one month).,
"Happily surprised with how amazing this app is. I was a long time user of Wunderlist and was very disappointed to switch over to their new app, Microsoft To Do and find it lacked some essential features I was used to. Todoist covers everything I want in a to do app and even features like connecting to your calendar that I haven't used before. My one hope was that I could sync my Wunderlist 'completed list' but that's my only suggestion.",
"Excellent little app for managing multiple tasklists in different categories, across several platforms. Easy and enjoyable to use and really helps me keep organised and see everything I need and want to get done. Loses a star for the greedy subscription pricing model, otherwise it is perfect for me; simply far too expensive for a simple tasklist manager, so I'll stick with the free version.",
"Amazing app. Definitely my to do app of choice. Wish it had a more robust Calander view, with a proper week view function. It's also increasingly hard to justify the premium, when free equivalents are getting so much better (Google's, apple, microsoft's), and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists (notion). A big gripe for me is that its design & UI is falling a little behind its competitors (things 3, apple reminders); which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app.",
"Absolutely the best to do app out there. Great UI, great features. Use it for general stuff, shared shopping lists and household tasks, projects... everything. Well worth it for the paid version too. The only features I'd like to see are more than once a day scheduling (eg. morning, noon and night; can workaround with multiple tasks) and repeatable projects (think recipes; can workaround with templates but difficult).",
"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",
"Loving your program, I've been using it for years. Thank you for your work! One function in Todoist is very missing - now when I complete a task on the tab ""today"" it disappears completely. However, it is much more convenient when it gets crossed out and goes to the end of the daily task list (like in Google Keep). When you see a task done today, you're very motivated to do more. This may be a paid function, but it's not in any form in the section ""today"" or ""coming"" now.",
"Great app. Some of the features that try to be a little ""smart"" are really annoying at times. Other features that would be useful are behind a pay wall (but reasonably priced). Need to make money to pay for costs so I can appreciate that and the core is free so really can't complain much. Keep up the work, great job :)",
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).",
"Everything WAS alright but then an update happened. I thought it would only affect the visual aspect but no. It causes lots of bugs. I cannot open projects, no tasks are showing in them. Turned on the completed tasks but they don't show. Problems with scheduling. Basically all the main features of the app are completely broken",
Horrible experince. Glitchy and slow with no user friendly interface. Waste of time to download check it out and uninstall after 10 minutes. On top of that the most important features are paid. But wait... its a subscription to pay ¬£4 monthly!! For a todo app which can't do something better than the hundreds free or those with one time payments. Cannot recommend to anyone.,
"Just downloaded this app after trying to find apps which would sync with other people. Finally I found one that is easy to use, accurate, neat and tidy. Only issue I have is with the reminders side of things. I wish the reminders had a ringtone just encase you don't hear the notification tone. But otherwise great app & I recommend it.",
"Subscription based. ¬£50 a year. For a todo list app. No. Imagine you put 10 or 20 similarly priced apps on your phone, you're losing ¬£500 to ¬£1000 per year, the price of a flagship phone! Every year! I'd have paid between ¬£5 and ¬£10 max for this app for the pro features. I'll look elsewhere, I'm not going to encourage this greed.",
"Really handy and has a reoccurring task option. I was looking for this feature and many other apps didn't have it for free. The layout is decently straightforward. There's also theme options. Even a level up system based on tasks completed, which is a good idea and a great motivator(,makes it somewhat game-like). Just what I needed üòÅüëçüèæ",
"The app is great with lots of features. If you are looking for simple to do list or tasks organiser then there are more simple apps. The reason for 3 stars is because the way of setting date and time, can't believe that I have to type: Saturday 23 Jan at 9 am!!! Never seen something like that, why can't it be regular calendar to select from? because of that I'm not able to include any day or tomorrow or yesterday...etc. in my task text, it will straight away captured as due date. Very annoying!!",
"Ad-free, sync with cloud, can manage recurring tasks (interface not suitable for beginners), widget is functional. Premium is very expensive, licence for home-use missing. However the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium. Greatest mistake: no way to backup / export my own data unless I pay. Don't be greedy - it is my data, and you lock it away. Missing auto backup in the free version is OK. But no way to export / download it is a no-go.",
"Editing my review now I've used this more: while I still think it's poor that the website says the free account supports 80 projects, when it is in fact only 5, the app, both on mobile and desktop is excellent. I've adapted to the limitation and found the app to very useful, I particularly like the natural language method of setting due dates/recurring tasks. Still, one star off for the mis-leading messaging!",
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its ¬£3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,
"It's alright. The UI feels rather out of date. Moving from one view to another for example feels like a chore. This could be done better by swiping. Since reminders are a premium feature the free version of the app is kind of pointless. It also seems like there is no option for a free trial of the pro version. Paying for an app before I know if Its any good, feels very outdated. Some features are restrictive without reason. For example you cant sort tasks manually in the today view.",
"Slick interface, intuitive.",
A great balance of features without being overly complicated.,
"Can only see completed tasks from last week, not recent completed tasks",
Good app to keep my day on track. Syncs well with other devices.,
"I love the app - it's been so handy for my university classes, I can make a project for each course and subsections with all my assignments. It's great to visualise what is coming up. ONLY downside I have is that I've recently got a new phone and for some reason I get 0 notifications from the app now - I used to get my daily list of tasks for the day, and now I get nothing, even though all my settings look correct. Bit of a shame, and I'm not sure how to fix it.",
"EDIT: After the fair dev reply and reflection, I can't deny Todoist's top quality and effort +1 star :) does what it aims to do very well, perhaps the best. However, I feel users trying to ""become"" organised, aren't going to benefit as much as users who ""already"" are. A little counter intuitive but the app does feel like it's an all in commitment, or nothing (just IMO, after a couple years of use). This may feel like another stressor to some. Again, it's a brilliant addition for the right user.",
"The app is good, but the ""upgrade to pro"" indications are intrusive and distracting. The UI/UX could be improved, and the customization options are too complex. Features are added without considering how they will interact with other features, which can cause problems. For now, I'm better off with the bare bones Google tasks with an awesome calendar integration. Plus, there I don't have to pay for reminders. Would have loved to have todoist lite pro with just the essential features.",
Was a great app the past 4 to 5 years that I've used it. But recently it kept crashing I'd reinstalled it twice. But the issue continued. It's been annoying when the crash window pops up in the middle of a task. I hope that there's a bug fix,
"If you sign up for this app, understand you will received excessive emails, without the ability to actually unsubscribe. I have tried REPEATEDLY, yet still receive emails weekly or more. I just tried again, marked no to everything, only to receive a ""tips and tricks"" email literally one minute later. I will never reconsider using this app after this bs.",
"Personally, for me, this is the best app for organizing my to-dos and basically my daily life! Plus it's accessible from many devices, which I rly need and so I rly love this app! Suggestion: a like label that can be seen on the front screen with the task would be a great addition! And maybe for visual aesthetic, a customizable background? Overall, it's definitely a great app! üòÑ thanks!",
"Best app I have ever used. Sensational. Basically I've always found it frustrating that neither Google tasks or microsoft to-do don't sycn up with Google calendar. THIS DOES! Also, what is great is that you don't see re-occuring tasks keep on repeating themselves on the task list (but they do appear when the day comes, and they show up on the Google calendar!!!). Honestly this app is amazing, what's more is that its completely free with no ads. You can also pay for the premium features!",
"Does everything i want it to do. Interface efficient and intuitive. A nice dark layout option that's easy on the eyes. love the feature of writing in the date or day and in automatically assigns it to that date. Motivated by the points system, as primal as that is. In short helping a lot on journey to productity.",
Todoist is my go to get-your-you-know-what-together app. It's super customizable which I really like. Also like being able to see my events/to-do's for the upcoming week. Only complaint is I wish there was a sort of calendar view where I could see a month at a time. I still use a paper calendar for that.,
"The app used to work fine for me until a few months ago I no longer get any notifications. I've fiddled with Android notification settings, app settings, reinstalling, and so on, but nothing worked. I'm able to fire a 'preview' from the app, but it doesn't come in on the time scheduled. Hopefully an isolated issue, but I can't rely on this at all anymore.",
You want me to pay $5 a month to use reminders... On a to-do list app? Lol,
"Lazy tech support. Just can't be bothered. Took down my initial adverse review to give tech support a chance to sort things out. They just couldn't be bothered. I'm using Nine email and having a problem sharing with Todoist when I want to create a task using an email. Sometimes it works, more often it doesn't. However sharing with Wunderlist works every time! Todoist tech support answer: sort it out yourself with Nine! UPDATE. After numerous emails to tech support they still haven't bothered.",
It has a bit more complexity than a simple todo list and feels more natural to use. I really like it. I just read eat that frog and i'm using my todoist to make plans and stuff. Plus you can make it pink or whatever colour you like and check on your activity log for a sense of satisfaction. The pro version is a tad expensive but it's important so you just have to put up with that. The free version isn't bad though.,
"The app is amazing and easy to use. I am finding that I am able to manage my time and activities efficiently and having more time on my hand that I am previously used to. Its also great because i can access it on all my devices. The app is an amazing concept, however it is disappointing that the free version is alot more limited that I thought. That being said it is an amazing tool to have at all times. I would recommended it to anyone and everyone.",
"I've found the app through Hannah Witton on YouTube, and have been using it for the past two weeks. It's really neat, you can setup an event entirely through texts, setting up priority, what category you want to put it under and when it should be done or to work on it. All those features are free, and there's more if you want to pay for it. (I'm a free user)",
"Just what I needed to Master My Day! I have been using Todoist for less than a year now and it has been better than what I had expected. It's constantly updated and useful new features are added regularly. It's easy to use, intuitive, integrates with most major apps or softwares you would need and looks great. The most important part to using it effectively is to be committed to doing the tasks you write down on this app (or any other app for that matter).",
"The widget scrolling messes up my home screen. I am on Oneplus, scrolling the widget makes me unable to use the swipe up gesture to open the app drawer. All other scrollable widgets work fine.",
I'm sure it would have been a great app but I'm tired of having to log in with e-mails and so on just for simple apps like tick lists. Sorry but unfortunately I'll download an other one. Good day.,
Free version doesn't have notifications for REMINDERS! What a scam! What is the point of having this app if it doesn't have freaking reminders? Like that's literally the entire point of this app. Shame on you guys.,
"The app shouldn't send a notification if no tasks are due today - there should only be a notification if there ARE tasks. Huge flaw to be unable to differentiate, functions more as spam and advertisement for the app.",
"Its a wonderful app, very helpful and organised, perfect and simple listing and task viewer, Just one more thing and the app will be 10/10, Would you please enhance the possibility to move subtasks to another project subtasks?",
"My tasks are done, done and done. The app is great.. really nice customisation has the features that help me focus on my tasks and finish them.",
I really like this app but printing tasks or subtasks feature is only available on desktop version app or web version only. Rest Perfect App for all Reminders,
Todoist is a really great Todo and Note app. It comes before Evernote in my workflow. You can make a Zapier connection to move a note from Todoist to Evernote. That's really great.,
"Wake me up when you finally be able to mark tasks as done in-place (Green check, Crossed out, greyed out, stay visible, stay in the same place) üò¥üí§ + Option to ""Reset"" my account to wipe everything clean as if new without deleting it.",
NOT FREE! You have to pay $77 a year for the most basic feature.. Reminders. That's right. There are No reminders! Unfortunately I am forced to go elsewhere.,
"If you're having trouble with the last update causing your widget to flash, just go into the app settings and log out of your account and back in. That fixed it for me.",
"minimalist, but also feature packed. doesn't push premium subscription stuff in your face either. all around great app!",
I've been a paying user for many years but looking for something better now. Reminders are only reminding sometimes since recent updates. Very disappointed.,
"Came as preinstalled bloat. Decided to open it and see if it was any good. I logged in, and immediately began receiving spam from them in my email.",
I'm really impressed. Full use of the features of this app has increased my productivity and satisfaction significantly. I no longer start things I never finish.,
"Todoist is a really good app and I think it is underrated. Since I downloaded it , it has helped me a great deal in not forgetting things . It is simple , fun and easy to use . Thank you for this app",
"It is great app for tasks listing and keeping track of things, but whenever i try to search for the widget my oneUI home keeps stopping, please look into this problem...",
Installed this app to see if I would like it and didn't use it so I uninstalled it the next day. Now I get emails and emails and emails. I don't need reminders about tasks I do not have. I don't even have this app installed nor do I use it.,
Just add full screen reminders like alarms and it will be perfect And if possible lower the price a bit just a little bit,
"So far it's alright, but the due dates are killing me. It literally says that you can do every 2 weeks, but it will not apply that or anything like it. Only certain days of the week, or a specific date.",
"This is a great app! The integration with Google Calendar is also a great feature, though it would be nice if it could ""strike through"" the event in Calendar once the item is marked complete in Todoist. In the way it is built right now you need to choose if you want to just keep or delete the Calendar events corresponding to completed tasks.",
Garbage app. The worst? Maybe. Clearly the result of Microsoft hiring for diversity not talent or qualifications which is company wide and why they haven't done anything good in 20 years,
"The best cross-platform to do application that works on all devices possible. Also, it's worth the premium subscription.",
"I was very much enjoying this app, then a new update came in that has made it almost useless to me. I thought it was a visual change but now I cannot even save my reminders or anything and putting in a date is so difficult because if it doesn't like the way you put it in it just does not register as a date. I may change my opinion if they fix these issues but I may have to find something else if they don't.",
"Non-usable Don't bother I tried this app as a replacement to my current tasks app that I've used for years. I was looking for a task list that was always up to date on all devices. However it has not stopped crashing since I installed it. Both my phone and tablet experience the same problem. Seems to be when I am trying to drag and drop. Anyhoo, I'm still using my current app which is heads and shoulders above Todoist, both in usability and features.",
The app is unusable due to constant crashes since recently.,
This app seems great. However I switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium. What the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually. They should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf. Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.,
"Great app, easy to use with friendly interface and customise options. But didn't stick to it for personal use as free version lacks essential features (like reminders, history, backup, limited labels, etc.). I think paid version has to offer something on top of free standard features (included to pre-installed Google apps) not charging for them.",
"the app is functional and the widget is very handy but the subscription model cost feels a bit much for all of the use I get out of it. I'd be much happier if it was a bit cheaper and when you consider some of the other free options that are out there, paying so much for so little feels like a bit of a con.",
"Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version. Gave up in frustration when I realized that to be actually useful I'd have to pay extra.",
"The functionality is excellent, it all seems good except the wearOS version does not have a tile, i want my watch with a list of the highest priority task and the one with the closest deadline, the first 5 tiles are the one i visit the most, and i NEED a tile, i need to have that list in front of me as much as possible, otherwise is very difficult for me to actually do my tasks and i just ignore them. This app NEEDS a watch tile or i will simply ignore it like all the other task apps i have used",
"The natural language processing is actually a game changer, not even kidding. I can type (or voice type) what I need to do and when, assign it priority if I need to, and set up recurring tasks eg ""for the next 3 Sundays"", all in a single field. You can edit it later but it makes it so much less effort to add things, which is important for something that's supposed to make life easier. Also the widget is really good, I have one home page with it full screen and I barely need to open the app",
"Why is it so hard to respond to a query email? I emailed you days ago to ask where ""completed tasks"" go, but to no response!",
"This app is amaizing. Best by far. I so regret spending money on other todo apps. For this one i am ready to pay about 20-30 euro per month, and it's only 3 euro per month. Everything is synced, app is constantly 60fps no lag no crashes. You can have it on PC, on phone, as browser extension and even on freaking smart watch. It has everything I ever would want from todo app. Documentation is very easy to read and takes about 2 minutes and you already know everything you need. It has a tonn of functionality but somehow manages to keep everything plain simple. Thank you for that app.",
"IMO, this is the best to-do app I have ever had the pleasure to use in my entire life! They have mobile and desktop versions for multiple platforms, and it also syncs with Alexa and likely Google Home too. Thank you so much to the developers behind this! Just wish there was an option for a pay-once lifetime premium membership. This is a great app, I really love it.",
"I like the way you're able to schedule the alarm using key words around the due date. Very convenient. Friggin awesome, man. This was the main feature that kept me from going back to any.do The alarms didn't seem to pop up enough for me to notice. Wat the fug. Tbh, I may have dismissed the notifications or I was put to sleep. Would try full version if trial was offered. Can't remember if it was offered with the account I originally created with :-)",
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist.",
"To do items, arranged into projects, can be one off or repeating and can optionally be assigned a date (e.g. a fortnightly reminder on a given day to put out your recycling for collection, a shopping list without dates). Relative days are automatically detected - e.g. ""tod"" for today, a generally helpful feature until you try to remember to call Tom, which results in an item ""call"" for the next day. Handy voice assistant integration to add items to your shopping list while preparing a meal.",
"I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me. It has too slim lines even without compact mode (compact is ridiculous, even though I have small fingers), the quick button to open the main app is gone and the WORST - it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them. Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track.",
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.",
"Awesome App. keeps me organized and helps me complete tasks every day. Also it doesn't nag me if I wasn't able to complete a certain task that day, it automatically moves the uncompleted task to the next day. Update : App worked fantastic until today when it stopped adding new tasks and continues to say in a pop-up message that I had reached the maximum limit and that I should upgrade to premium to be able to continue using app. I do not wish to upgrade!",
"I really like this app. I use if as a widget on my phone so I can easily see what else I have to do for the day. BUT, I recently got a fit bit versa 3, and the apps will not sync. I keep getting the ""getting started"" orange screen, asking me to allow permission for fit for todoist app on the fitbit app. Everyone is switched to on, and it won't work. Even paid for the Fitbit app. Deleted both todoist apps, turned off both devices and still nothing. I emailed the app yest., waiting on responss",
"You have to pay for reminders, and I think that's stupid. Every single other app in the world sends me push notifications I DON'T want, and now, in the context of an app that keeps track of tasks you have to get done, notifications telling you to do those tasks are a premium service? Seriously, give me a break... I'll just use Google Keep Notes after all...",
So it might not seem fair to rate this app based solely on how it runs on the computer but I need a to do list to work on both and the computer app straight up does not work. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and restarted my computer with no success.,
"Disspointing and unprofessional. No ability to restore deleted tasks or projects. Not even on Pro accounts. I accidently deleted my list. 100% user error, no doubt about it. My bad. There is no ability to either undo your deleted item or get it back out of a trash folder and restore it. The only method to do this is via a ‚Äòbackup‚Äô which only occurs on Pro accounts‚Ä¶ but EVEN WITH a Pro account the backup only occurs at 00:00 daily. Meaning even with a Pro account if you delete something its gone.",
"I was looking for an app that kept my to do list untill completed and thought I'd give this one a try. Install it, log in with Google, first thing it shows; my thesis as task for 2018. Well I'm sure the app does what I am looking for. e ‚ú® Edit: One star off, it misses one crucial function. A repeat button for reoccuring tasks. Esit 2: Thanks for the advice.",
"Exactly, you just focus on what we did (and it makes sense, of course). Although, I think that to give us more insight about what we didn't do would be really good. I mean, just an option to mark tasks as ""uncompleted"" and show that in the statistics and this app would be even better. To let the app know what I really did from all that stuff that I scheduled for the week, for example, or even for the month would really give us rich information about how productive we have really been.",
"This app has so many features that at first I worried it was making things LESS productive; with so many different ways you can categorize items, comment on tasks, add files, set reminders, etc., I wondered if I was spending more time assigning myself tasks than I would just writing stuff down in a calendar! But after playing with it for a bit and streamlining how to best use the app for my purposes, I find it hugely useful. The integration with Google calendar is also super handy.",
very useful for teamwork & schedule planning at work,
"Such an awesome app! I used it for a while and eventually moved onto something else trying out new features. I came back to Todoist after about a year and the experience on Samsung phones is so much better than almost every other productivity app out there!! I immediately went for the paid version, well done devs! Those late nights are really paying off! Very very good experience! üëçüèº",
"I liked the app, I wanted to apply premium but the problem was the widget, sometimes it freezes; whenever i click the task/note the options won't activate so I would have to open the app itself. And lastly it would be amazing if you can insert options to customize the widget settings, e.g. change default fonts, customize the widget line spacing and etc. If this happens I will surely apply for a year subscription",
"way too many buttons to press go get a quick list done ""automatic"" unwanted re-odering of sub-tasks, really annoying in daily lists ms to do is way more efficient",
"Great app, super-useful at what I use it for (reminding me to do stuff/suggesting good times to procrasniate until üòÇ). Even better if you use the desktop website with it too, if you spend time sitting in front of a PC anyway (like I do). Probably even better if you pay for premium (there are premium features, I don't pay for them). Just about the most recent update, is there any chance of getting some more in-depth notification settings? I really appreciate the ability to get both emails, and push notifications, cos i check my email on my phone and my PC hahaha",
"Best to do app I've used so far. I use it as a simple way to note down distracting tasks I want to do later as well as a pseudo-scheduling app. It's easy to stay organized using projects and the due date feature help me keep on track with upcoming deadlines. Overall, it's helped me from forgetting important things I need to get done, and also focus better.",
"A couple of questions before I re-install the app: 1. Do I have to un-install it first? 2. Will I lose any of my data if I un-install the app (I have entered a lot of tasks which I don't want to re-enter) Thanks for your help. Hi Doist! OK, I reinstalled your app and the good news is that all my ToDos are still there after I logged in! The bad news is that after turning on the Task Complete Tone on ""Mobile"", the app would make that sound about 3 seconds after I closed it, every single time. Turning off the tone did not stop it sounding each time I closed the app. But, after rebooting the phone with the Tone turned off, the app stopped sounding the tone when I closed it. So it's nice and quiet now! My phone is Android 6.",
"The concept idea is really good, but navigating the app is extremely confusing. Even after reading through their help page twice I could not figure out how to perform even the simplest of tasks, and quite a lot of useful tools are hidden behind a paywall. I downloaded the app in the hopes of easing my stress, the last hour has been nothing but stress with this app and I have accomplished nothing.",
"Something wrong with latest update? Android widgets are flickering, deleting and re-adding doesn't help.",
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards.",
"Super easy to use! I have the business account and I highly recommend it, especially if you have a team for projects. Also, I love the Google calendar integration, makes my workflow much better as I am constantly informed of my upcoming tasks wherever I look! Only thing is would be nice to have start/finish times but other than that great üòÅ",
"Is setting reminders and labels really worth being a premium feature? In my opinion the app is literally useless without them. If it was a $5 one time purchase then maybe it would be fair, but $48 per year is ridiculous. All of the premium features are easy to emulate with apps that came with my phone. I hate how even the simple apps have to be subscription based nowadays, even for something as simple as a bloody to do list.",
Best todo list app in the market. I've been using it for years and it's worth every penny that I pay for the premium subscription. Love this app.,
"Been using it for a day and love it. Already thinking of upgrading BUT the free version works perfectly fine for now. One thing i would change is to have a change to show added time of task on the note (you can see it under three dots for the task but if i could press an option to see it on the task itself without extra click would love it), like an option from settings.",
"Nice look and feel but integrations are random and hopeless. Syncing with Google calendar either doesn't work at all or creates endless duplicates. Which have to be deleted individually. The lack of integrated time recording is annoying. There are other alternatives with fewer issues. After a couple of pandemic years perseverance, I've moved on",
"It's so handy to be able to make notes on the go. I find the app very easy to use and I like being able to separate tasks into projects, prioritise and reschedule, as needed. I don't need reminders at the moment, so haven't gone premium, but can see how that would be useful.",
I think it is the best app I could ever tried It has helped me get more organized. in the short future I will upgrade. thank you Todoist.,
"The new update is hard to use. It is taking up more time to go through projects because the 'see all' is at the bottom and I have to click it. What usually takes 2 seconds swiping, takes 5. It may not be a lot but frankly, it reduces the enthusiasm to go through different projects. Not a fan.",
"Looking at the features and lots of accolades I tried uninstalled after just a trial. Reason: In the free version notification feature is missing. If the task misses the set time, there is no notification. We will come to know only if we open the app. Insanely Ridiculous. Not sure what have the product team thought while excluding such a basic feature.",
Perfect!!! This app is exactly what I was looking for. I purchased the Edge panel companion as well for easy access. It has all the features I was looking for in a to-do type app. The dark grey is great - only upgrade would be an AMOLED black theme option. Keep up the great work!,
"The best productivity app ever. After adding today's tasks widget to my phone's main screen (Android), adding a 1-click button to record a task into Inbox, adding a GMail plugin to convert emails into tasks and setting up recurring habits and prioritization labels -> I now have much more peace of mind and results on all the small errands that used to drag on and then result in bigger problems when not solved. Love how the guides linked in the app teach you to have a simple yet reliable system!",
"The homepage should have the option to view just the tasks for the day (without the overdue tasks - those can be in another tab/list). Sometimes what i want is just a clean canvas to plan my day but i open this app & am reminded of the ton of things i didn't do :'-) There should also be an option to select multiple tasks & delete them all at once (i forgot about the app, but the web version doesn't seem to be able to do this & i have to manually delete tasks one by one to get that clean canvas)",
"the app is good and I've switched to it from TickTick but then i switched to Microsoft Todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing. don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd. maybe fix the design, add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great",
"Excellent todo tracker! Very fast on start up, super clean and tidy. I especially love the karma feature, which compares the completed daily tasks. However having the reminder feature under the paid features (which is a fairly steep price) is a no+go for me. But i encoirage people to check it out, since apart from that, it's just excellent at what it does",
"Love the app.....had issues with it stopping syncing with Alexa ToDo list, meaning I had to delete items in both Alexa lists, and Todoist lists, then delete the lists in Todoist, and set up to sync again. Since doing that it seems to be working. Impressed the developer contact me to check whether it was working. The programme and app are both brilliant, and very customisable.",
"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list. It was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes.",
"Thanks god I found your application! I'm very satisfied with how I can manage multiple goals, not just daily but also long term goals in diferent aspects like work, health, improvement and so on. Your gadget is very configurable and I can sort as I want ü•∞ the integration with google calendar is everything I could ask for. And all of this is free!!!! All the rest I just a great plus to a beautifly thought product. You rocks!!!",
This is a great app and I am getting a lot more done than I was before. The only downside is that the premium subscription is a little pricey for a todo app. Seems like a lot of companies are opting for subscriptions to keep the gravy train coming instead of allowing us to buy the app outright. I'd rather own it outright than pay every year or month.,
"I love this app! Easy to figure out, you can add tasks, sub-tasks, sections, and projects so you can organize everything into smaller pieces so your to-do list doesn't feel so overwhelming. The website is great but the app and widgets are equally useful. Would recommend to anyone who needs a new way to keep track of their to-do list.",
"Subscription is to expensive for supported features. It is not easy to oversee all the things gooing on. I could not create ""subsections"" in my personal routines section to keep things stuffed. Also it is not possible to mark something as ""not done"". Especially for reoccuring routines this would make perfectly sence. Another rather bad thing is, that it is not easy to analyze progress or precission. Especially for routines a statistical analysis would be good. Also a visualization for due dates.",
"I wish this app could STFU a little bit. The purpose of a to do list is to courage you to do your stuff, not to check every unnecessary pings and emails. I was looking around the app, making simple tasks to get the feel, and then I got bunch of emails every few hours. Two days later I finally had time to find email notifications checklist in settings. 4 out of 5 email notification types that help NOTHING with what you do. Wow. Just set it off on default, everyone hates spammy apps.",
"I was delighted by this app. Hence, i went for the premium subscription. There are two things i request the developers to look into. 1. There must be a proper notification. Better if we get some kind of alarm kind of notification. Right now, the notification feature is not that effective. 2. I have done integration with the Google Calendar. But if you put a task on a particular date and time, it is added in the calendar as an one hour task by default. Later, i go to the calendar to change it",
"I've gone through many apps. This is a very flexible app - really comfortable to create tasks, projects and goals! Has both web and app versions. I would probably call the projects section something different because it could be every day routines, study goals, work projects etc. Nevertheless I was looking for that category/feature and it's the only app that provides with such clever and simple user interface! Thank you!",
No notifications even after allowing notifications,
i love this application. it's very handy for your daily study routine. I'm sure others can benefit loads from this todoist.,
"On limited trial, it was not intuitive to use and the paid version is required to set a reminder. The app should just be a paid app only then. What's the use of this app without the ability to set a simple reminder? With so many task list apps out there, I've been going through trying them out and this one was a quick uninstall.",
"I use Todoist every day for work. It's easy to use and very handy! In one click, I turn a mail into a task linked to a project. I enjoy getting a feedback of my productivity at the end of the year, when Todoist gives me all the stats about the tasks achieved, the number of projects, etc. Keep up the good work!",
"This is the best to-do app I've used due to the subtask power. For example, I can assign due dates for individual subtasks in addition to the main task. This is extremely beneficial in managing one's time. Also, the inbox is, in my opinion, brilliant. I can input, via voice recognition , a task that needs to be done. I don't know when I can get to it and I don't know how I want to categorize it. So, I put it in the inbox to be scheduled and categorized when time permits. Projects are great also.",
"I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product.",
"I love this app! It's exactly what I needed for my new business to keep me on track. It's really easy to use and has so many features. Because my tasks are so complicated I signed up for premium, but it's only a few dollars a month which is so worth it to me to keep up. I wanted the color coding and labeling for tasks within a project as well as the notifications which is what premium gives me. But even just the basic one I think would be really good for just regular every day to do lists.",
"Have been having issues since last update, when adding a to do, it defaults to go to the inbox folder, instead of going right to 'today' list. So have been forgetting to do stuff because I didn't see it lol. 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed. EDIT: Sane thing happens when I am on today tab and have it set as homepage .",
I absolutely love this. Especially the karma thing. It just makes me want to get to the next karma level. Almost like a video game where I have to try max out my character by completing tasks. What would be cool though is if there was some kind of seperate thing where you can tick off your breaks. (Because breaks are important),
"Wonderful app I've used and happiliy paid for for years now. Unfortunately, the quick capture is not working effectively. On my phone (android 12) it tends to crash when trying to quickly create tasks, for example: - click shortcut to camera -> make picture -> click on share into task -> Todoist crashes. Or seem to get stuck in loading task info, for example when: Create new task via widget -> go to task via shortcut 'show' that appears right after adding a task. Help is appreciated (:",
"A nice, solid, basic app for tasks. I enjoy the features of being able to have different projects, priorities and easy scheduling. The push notification doesn't seem to work unless I've recently opened the app, so usually I get a notification of the day's tasks after I've already opened the app to check manually. I'm on a Huawei android. That's a big minus unfortunately.",
The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.,
"Fantastic app and the best on the market for to do lists! I've not come across a platform that automatically groups my tasks for today in one easy to find place. Not even Google or Microsoft can do this! I link my account to every device I have including my WearOS watch. I used to use Google Tasks and you'd think Google would include their own tasks app onto their watches but no! Since then, I've converted to todoist and I've not been disappointed! I use it daily to keep up with all my tasks!",
"Been using the app every day for years to track everything I need to get done from day to day. One of my favorite apps. It's likely my #1 most used app. Easy to use. Update: Since the radio buttons were added to mark tasks as complete, Im findind that sometimes tasks are accidentally being remived from my list. Not a fan of the radio buttons! - too easy to accidentally click in them.",
"Love the app. I especially appreciate being able to drag and sort so easily. Completed task can be hidden or displayed. The options on how to organize projects are wonderful. Filters, labels, color coding, it's all there. Def would recommend.",
"Great way to keep track of what you need to do. Task streaks and karma are a good incentive to get things done. I use the standard free version which is good for setting, planning and completing tasks. My husband uses premium because he thinks its worth paying for a well made useful app. Our productivity has gone up significantly since we started using the app.",
"You need to pay to get something as basic as reminders (specifying time of the task). Just make the app fully premium. Disgusting, how phone app creators try to squeeze anything out of you for the most basic things, that no one in their right mind would ask money for on a pc. 50 eur a year for this basic app! That's half of what I pay for Photoshop.",
"I used the app for about 3 days before realizing it wasn't a good fit for me. I wanted to use the widget more than the app itself, but I was frustrated with the way recurring events and subtasks work. I even checked reddit and online for a solution, but without success. Instead of listing subtasks as same priority as the parent task during scheduling, I wanted things to remain nested and recurring. After attempting to make things work, I gave up and tried TickTick instead, which has been better!",
"Needed a good list for Wear OS use only (no phone), and this was almost perfect --- except there's no confirmation when marking a list item complete, so it's really easy to accidentally remove an item unintentionally, and it's impossible to undo a completion from the watch interface. So close, and yet so far.",
This app is great for helping me to stay organized. Seeing the number of overdue tasks plus tasks for the day helps me to look realistically at how I need to manage my time to avoid getting overwhelmed. It has been a game changer for me and I would recommend Todoist to anyone who struggles with time management and staying organized.,
This app has changed a lot since i last reviewed it and has done life saving properties. The recurring properties are the most helpful and also on desktop smart date recognition. The options for recurring dates has allowed me to schedule so many things and then just forget about them until later... it has made me more conscientious .,
Really helpful and awesome tool to have. Love that I can just reschedule things to different dates when I don't get around to them! Has definitely made it feel like life is more manageable when I can just add something as I think about it and schedule it to the most appropriate date... helps me not feel overwhelmed under an avalanche of things to do! Great app :),
"started using the app recently so I thought I'd give a review of my first impressions!! really useful, not very simple to use at first, but gets easier as you understand how it works. I really wish there was an option to see done tasks?? I could be wrong but I'm under the impression that when you select ""done"" they're gone for ever.",
"its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list",
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.",
"its kind of odd, imo, that a todo app doesnt automatically include notifications unless you pay for premium. however they do offer integration into my calendar app, which DOES notify me, after a fashion. the widget allows you to switch between all sorts of views. love the natural language for setting thibgs up, general ease of adding a task and categorizing it, the ""postpone"" feature i just discovered, ease of editing, reoccurring subtasks can have different intervals than the overarching task..",
"I have been using this app for over an year and I haven't found any feature that I wanted to use but couldn't find in the app. You can create projects, timelines, set priorities, sync tasks & schedules with your calendar, set reminders, add sub tasks, put up task description and so much more... Just start using and you will never be disappointed.",
"It is the BEST 'lists and tasks app' I have used. As a person who functions around organised lists, I would say it meets all my needs in a 'lists and tasks app'. The schedule settings, subtask options, sections are all very helpful. Even the free version is great. It would have been perfect for me if it had a 'notes' option (I haven't found such an option). Overall a great app. Will continue using.",
"This app makes my life easier! Very comprehensive features, consistent, stable and, above all, easy to use. I had been long searching for a powerful, networked, yet straightforward app to do project management that would include my team members. Nothing fitted the bill until I found Todoist. The fact that I can use it on mobile or desktop makes it even more versatile! This one is among my 3 favorite apps. Big thank you to the developers... keep up the good work, guys!",
"Best to do list app! After wunderlist, anydo and others Todoist is the simplest and best one. The interface is minimal and clean and adding tasks is a breeze thanks to the many shortcuts and smart text recognition of dates. Premium gives some nice extra features but they are definitely not required to use this app.",
"I'm now having issues with the widgets. When I click any button on the task widgets it does not pop up any main program or settings menu, it was working like yesterday and suddenly stopped working now. I tried to remove and add back the widget and restart my device but the problem still exists. It does not affect too much on using the app but now I have to find my app in my folder instead of click it from the home screen. Bit inconvenient :(",
"I regret not using this app sooner. It felt so relieving when I know I can integrate it with other apps, it makes me easier to track my tasks, not every to-do list app can do this üò£. It has a simple and pleasing design but with various and powerful features, it's a complete all-in-1. I've been a fan of making to-do lists for years and Todoist is by far the best app for it ‚ù§Ô∏è",
I love this app. It's very well thought out. One suggestion is to have a bubble that can float over other apps for adding new tasks. Quite often I'm reading from texts or emails and having to bounce back and forth to/from the Todoist app. A floating bubble would make it much easier.,
"Pretty good app for task management. The natural language processing makes it really easy to add new tasks on the go without having to do much to keep them organized. The all already supports Material You internally if you're into it so it looks nice too, it's a shame It hasn't adopted the dynamic icon yet, it's one of the few missing on my home screen",
"PREVIOUSLY: The best to-do app by a million billion miles! I have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability- excellent system. 26/10/19 UPDATE: This major update to your app is, for me, unfortunately counter intuitive, poor and makes my life harder! I like enhancements to apps but sometimes, as in this case, fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse. Many of the new ""features"" make the app worse!",
"Please get rid of the check mark boxes or give us an option to opt back to swiping. Other than that, I've been using and loving this app for years! It is exactly what I need as a college student, worker, mom, and just someone who likes keeping household tasks in order. I could only love this app and widget more if you got rid of those check mark boxes, please! I accidentally hit like 5 items in one day alone. thanks!",
Desktop version is not native software. I think it runs on electron. No desktop widget features. Ticktick desktop version has more features than this one and also bit cheap(not much just saying). Also there is no reminder for free version. So no chance to see if reminders works perfectly before subscription. Anyways since it lacks so many feature I uninstalled it.,
"By far the best task management app I have used, and i have tried A LOT both professionally and personally. The integration with google calendars is a life saver, there are a lot of options that I always wished for in other apps (sharing with other people, repeating tasks, multiple projects, easy to move between projects, SUPER low maintenance). Bought premium immediately and deleted all my other task apps.",
"Has almost all of the functionality I wanted out of a to-do list. The sentence interpretation towards repeated tasks is intuitive and well implemented. More nebulous tasks such as ""first weekend of the month"" don't seem to work, but that's a minor issue given the robust nature of the rest of the app.",
"Great simple app ! I have free version now. I probably need to get the premium version to duplicate and move tasks. Some questions : Does it allow the moving or duplicating of subtasks to another task ... or the elevating of a subtask to be a task or vice versa. Also, are reminders sent as notifications or sound or both.? Also, does it keep a log of completed tasks and/or subtasks. and if so, can you view or export it in some way? With these features it's a 5 ‚≠ê app‚ùó",
"I tried all calendar and tasks apps to organise my lists before finalising Todoist! Todoist manages to assign subtasks and is flexible with way you schedule them. The interface is just right for engagement and it is available for all modes - web/browser, windows and android which worked amazingly well for me for now. Hope the app design doesn't change much. Kudos!",
"It's a great productivity tool but with reminders behind an expensive per month paywall, it lacks probably the most important function. I'd try something else, despite the great UI It's a good app, I'd pay for it if it was a one off payment but ‚Ç¨30 a year? That's too much.",
"I have a notes app built into my phone that I use. I researched and found an article where someone tried 4 different to do list options. This one sounded best to me, as most people, like me, usually have their phone right there. But my notes app also has where I can put things in the order I'd like to do them. If you can add that feature, I'll try again.",
It checks the devices network connectivity before attempting to connect to the service. This causes an error which prevents people with perfectly functional internet from connecting to the app for no reason. So few apps have this issue & I didn't expect such poor app design from a large company like ToDoIst. This could be fixed in 10 - 20 minutes.,
"I deleted the app(because i was not using it) but right after I deleted the app it starts sending me emails on my account almost, one mail daily ""You have no tasks due today, but you do have 6 overdue tasks. It's okay to reschedule, delegate and even delete tasks! Give it a try. It's liberating...""",
"I've used Todoist nearly every day for two years. As a student, I start every semester by adding sections for my classes (plus a misc section) and filling them out based on the syllabus. I tell people ""if it's not on my todo list, I will forget about it."" I love how I can make tasks in seconds or spend more time to add a due date, section, label, priority, and subtasks. I can add an assignment when a professor mentions it then add details later. I couldn't get my degree without this app.",
"Unintuitive. Every day tasks get scheduled one day over if you didn't complete them. Sucks for daily routines. Also sorting doesn't carry over to ""today"" list and subtasks will be displayed separately on ""today"" tab, so you cant check them off under main task one at a time. No options to fix those behaviours, nonsense.",
"I have the premium version, but the app doesn't show the (added future) repeating tasks. I've tried typing in, ""every 25th"", ""every 25th of the month"", etc. and I only end up with the one reminder displayed. However, Google Calendar DOES work--consistently and easily--with setting and SHOWING repeating reminders. Please tell me how to have all the future reminders appear in the upcoming months. Once this issue is fixed, I will consider 5-stars because it's an otherwise nice organizational tool.",
"Todosit is the great to do list in the market... It's native typing based creation is the my favorite one.. But, still I am looking some additional feature which are mandatory (imo) for better scheduling. They should extend to show the repeated task for atleast week rather than a day.. I am bit struggling whenever I am looking weekly overview. The second one is, time boxing.. Always I need to search some other tools for time boxing",
Great app but too pricey for students unfortunately.,
"This app has been indescribably useful to me. Todoist brings a multifaceted solution the daily struggles of ADHD‚Äìstruggles that are hard to convey to the people around me. They have a library of helpful guides, templates & intuitive features that together create clearly defined structure I so desperately need‚Äìwith the flexibility to move on when I inevitably become stuck. Plus, these ingenius shortcut keys give me the speed to keep up with my ever-changing train of thought.",
"Update; The app crashes after the update, any update soon regarding this problem? I just wanna say that this app really deserves every bit of 5 stars. I love how the app was changed but in a good way. The free feature stuffs is really amazing. The karma mode is what makes this app attractive for me. It motivates me to finish my task and achieve the most high. Been using since 2019, and I can say that I have really improved. Finished 1560+ tasks. ü§ó",
"Everything is just *chef's kiss* you people'always try to keep the app up to date and perfect almost all the times. I'm an advocate of this app. I would further more appreciate it, if you would give a better experience for android tablet, the web app is perfect, its just that the application doesn't takes use of the more screen real estate in a tablet it looks like a stretched version of mobile app If you could etter optimize it for tablets to give the that todoist experience they get on web app",
Having one place for all my lists and projects has been really enjoyable. I would probably like the premium better for more accurate and times reminders but otherwise the basic todoist app is really nice. Being able to share a project with my hubby is helpful so we can split up during shopping while checking off the same list.,
"Too greedy on the premium features. I'm not going to pay monthly for the ability to add a description/comment to my task. Without this, you have a one liner for the task. There are tons of alternatives that do the same things as this app. I tried this one, the premium features don't interest me and the rest isn't worth a subscription.",
"I love this app, but it's not as user friendly as on a laptop.",
best to do list app EVER !! i've often switched between apps but i had this for the longest time. it's very friendly and easy to use and i lovee the design. it's perfect as a phone widget too and it can be accessed easily. what i like the most is that it syncs to different devices very well and quickly. also has nice features to help organize things so it wont be cluttered,
"This app really is my favorite task list. I previously used todoist a year ago but wanted to try out google notes for the sake of keeping all the services under one google product. I really made an effort to get used to google notes but it just wasn't cutting it. todoist is so cool and awesome, my favorite feature is the option of a widget when you swipe down from the top, anyways, just wanted to say IM BACK!!!",
"I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.",
"you must be thinking, it's just a note-taking app. how different can different note taking apps can be at all? Nope. it's the subtleties and details where they've really worked up. instead of selecting the project i want to enter, just add a #. and it detects reminders very well also. Awesome app.",
"It's an okay app but not what I was looking for. Very complicated. Also don't think it's a good idea to send emails to your customers every single day, tips or anything, they're really not reading those and it's just flooding inboxes.",
"Hi can I have an OPTION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE NEW AND OLD DESIGNS OF THE WIDGET? The previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks, while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width, which disables full reading of the task(bad). Also, subtasks cannot be seen WITHOUT CLICKING the main task, which kinda defeats the purpose(again) of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything. Thanks",
"I am a firm believer that task management tools have to fit in with one's personal style of thinking and checking off and organizing tasks. For me, I spent many weeks or months trying different tools and chose todoist. Been a while now, and it has made life so much simpler for me. The projects/labels/filters etc work perfectly for the way I organized things. The quality has been pretty good too.",
"Todoist has been my go-to app for keeping a track of my tasks. What makes it my favorite is the way you can just type ""buy bread tomorrow"" and it automatically sets the reminder for tomorrow, rather than you having to manually set the date. The only issue I have is that when my Samsung phone goes into power saver mode, and then comes out of it, the Todoist widget doesn't load. I thought it would be fixed with updates, but it's never resolved. Hence one less star.",
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.",
"This app was good to use for a while, but when it started to glitch on me, tech support was not helpful. They kept telling me they were working on the issue but never fixed it. The app was nice to use and helpful, but if it ever stops working customer service is no where to be found. It's not worth the money or the headache.",
"DO NOT BUY the premium if you need Alexa and/or Outlook to integrate like they falsely claim this ap does or you need any support from Todoist. Outlook integration has never been a synced integration, it only forwards tasks one-way & only works with limited Outlook paid platforms. They have Alexa issue notice seen only when you try to set it up, no warning before buying believing you can integrate both. No Support response yet. I want my money back. Such waste of hours. I feel scammed",
"Just one thing: The physics behind the functionality of grabing a task are inaccurate. Personally, it takes me several attempts to get a task in the right parent when there are multiple levels of tasks in my list. I think the horizontal placement should be more responsive and less delayed(ish) Thanks for the app which is great tho.",
Great app! perfect for work where I have a lot of moving parts. Without it I'd be scrambled. I'm able to sync this on my desktop and it integrates everything from my app seamlessly. Please consider adding a feature creating a separate area for work and personal task.,
One of the Todo apps I have used for the longest time without having made the attempt to try any other out there. After a few months of basic I upgraded to the Pro and I can say Worth the Money for sure. Syncs on all devices and as a great web interface too which make sure all my tasks and reminders and captured instantly. The Windows app is a bit faulty... But then I think Windows itself has some complaints most of the item. The web interface helps in those cases.,
"Amazing app for personal task management. Input is stupid easy, it can be accessed from any device, and the layout is extremely intuitive. I've used this app for years, and have even tried to migrate to other apps only to keep coming back.",
"Almost everything great. Sugestion: when I edit a subtask and I click ""done"" the app sends me back to the board or ""project"" screen, is better if after clicking ""done"" we could go back to the task screen because sometimes I have to edit many tasks within a project and is annoying that it kicks me out every time. In android",
"I tried a bunch of the other top todo apps and like this the best. The simplicity of creating tasks and tagging tasks in natural language is great, as well as the ability to deeply customize your taxonomy with labels and sub projects. I'd probably rate it 5 if the note taking experience was better. ""notes"" are just ""comments"", and look terrible outside of mobile. They're given tiny real estate on web UI. Feel like it be better if projects/tasks had a dedicated ""summary"" field.",
"I've been using this app for like 2 years for personal use, haven't tried the premium business looking version. ü§î it has been very useful,for my day to day and longer projects. Totally recommend for 2 reason: 1) Constant updates and improvements 2) I'm quite sure this is the smoothest task manager across platforms available in the market. (from what I know)",
"I'm currently using todoist premium, and unfortunately it ain't worth it. There are lot of restrictions in free version i.e., a simple thing as reminder option (really? Any free app allows that function). Also, it doesn't have any proper calendar view like Google Calendar. The Date parsing and natural language works fine. Other than that, I didn't find anything worth buying premium and free version doesn't provide much functions. There are other apps like TickTick that's same but better. üëçüèº",
"I tried multiple list/schedule apps this week, this one (fingers crossed) is working out great. I am using the free version for 3 days so far, easy to understand and if confused, many little videos to show the different features. I also have fallen in love with the complete for the day, I battle with depression so keeping lists helps me know I am accomplishing things but this app goes above my expectations with the graph showing how you are doing, thank you programmers",
"A wonderful app, for me it lacks only one, but importthing: a recurring task counter. I remember writing an email to you like 4-6 years ago about it, still not that much progress in this regard:) Sometimes i want to complete a task after 50 repetitions, not up to a certain date. Can't do it on Todoist though. Also would love to know how many times I've completed a certain recurring task, can't do this either:( i am considering switching but all the other stuff is so good I am still in doubt.",
This app is so amazing for planning! But it would be even better if we could color code and add a bigger calender for our tasks/projects! That way we can have a much better oversight of everything that needs to be done and what is what depending on the colors. I still highly recommended this app for those who are constantly busy! The developers did a wonderful job with this.,
"I give it 3 stars as the design looks good and the customization is also good. It allows you to create project, and add sections to avery project then add tasks. It lets you set a dat/timeline but the free version wont even allow you a single reminder. That seems like a very basic function to have in a Todo List/planing app, so not being able to use it at all without paying (meaning I couldn't test the basic function of the app for me) was what made me uninstall it.",
"12/1/20 edit: All of my previous grievances have been corrected and improved upon including being able to add new tasks with due dates in the widget and having them auto-sort. Props on the improvements, keep up the good work :) March review: New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.",
"Huge pain to delete. I immediately realized I would not use this app, and tried to delete. It took forever to find out how, and then I was told I needed to set a new password to delete everything. I did that, and then it gave me a random error saying to try again later. Very frustrating for something I literally do not even want to be interacting with anymore!!",
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.",
"The app works just fine and helped me a lot. But recently the widget has been creating problems. It refuses to show me my tasks on the widget. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this is the third time. I hope it is fixed, if on my end then be it that but I really don't want to move in from this app.",
"Overall it's a great tool that has helped me better organize my projets and plan ahead, and not forget tasks anymore. The only critic I would have concerns the reminders : I don't understand why it is not possible to simply select a time and date, rather than writing the reminder. It feels more tedious to write ""next Tuesday at 9 AM"" rather than simply selecting it.",
"I find the app very intuitive and robust for my needs. I love the various thoughtful integrations (i.e., Outlook and with my Google Assistant). My one minor complaint is the frequency of updates to the app and desktop version. I've worked with software developers before and standard practice is to bundle updates together in less frequent releases. Here, it is not unusual to have several updates per month.",
"Just getting started and this isn't very intuitive and I can find no where to set up recurring tasks. This looks like it's just a copy of Planner from Teams. Not a good model to copy. Edit from dev feedback: Based purely on how bad an idea that recurring tasks would be set by the task name is, I'm deleting the app. üôÑüëé",
"This is a marvelous app, trust me I have installed almost every app, nothing comes near to this. One of its kind. Now that being said I would like to give some improvement suggestions. Please add separate notification for separate task, make them ""sticky"" so that someone can't just push it away and add ""completed"" or ""later"" buttons on the notification so that one can update tasks without opening the app. And please don't make it a premium feature. Thank you.",
"I'm doing what I decry - leaving a bad review even though I didn't try the product. I just want to say I don't mind paying for an app if it's worth it. Developers should get paid for good work. This one, however, requires a subscription. I had to install it and create an account before I could find out the upgrade cost. The cost isn't terrible for a good app, but I'm not buying another subscription for for another thing. I'm really getting tired of everything requiring subscriptions.",
"Holy cannoli I freaking LOVE this app! There are so many features and tools to get me organized!!!!! I do have the premium version which has already paid for itself in value. I've been watching how to videos to get more familiar with the app, without watching them I would say there is a bit of a learning curve. This app will be used more than any other app on my device. I love that you can use it on phone and computer. I did a lot of research before choosing a to do list app and it paid off!",
"Quite a helpful app. I rate based on my overall experience of Todoist. I give 4 stars since I've come across misc bugs, mostly in the web app...the Android version has never bugged on me actually. the web/desktop app bugs are usually very small and usability impact is quite small. the todoist team is responsive to bug reports but when I see bugs I don't report, they seem to linger for quite a while",
"It is an amazing app. Helps you list down task, prioritise it and schedule reminders for the same. The themes to have multiple options to choose from. The only issue I face sometimes is that I can't check off a task from the widget list created on my home screen. That is the only reason for the 4 star review.",
I find the app super useful. I have a young baby so I will think of things I need to do but then have to change a nappy etc. and I forget. I now just bang it into the app and do it when I can. I feel like there could be more features like the ability to add lists to tasks. It may be there are more features if I pay.,
"I've been using todoist for years and it's gone from strength to strength. This app runs my life and I wouldn't have it any other way. Whether complex project management, medication reminders, payment schedules or shopping lists everything is simple to structure in an intuitive way that has kept me organised and on task.",
"I'm increasing my review to 4 stars after experiencing a very frustrating issue with the app and widget in the last 2 weeks. It seems to be fixed and actually functioning better than before in the last few days. As long as it stays this way and doesn't have further issues, I can strongly recommend Todoist, and I'm glad I don't have to find a new app.",
This app is fantastic!!! I have anf will continue to recommend this to anyone eho is trying tobetter prioritize and organize their lives. I especially like using this for my college courses. I love being able to get the full course syllabus in ahead of time to organize and keep up with everything else in life as well.,
"Some issues with the widget in Android, the rest is perfect. The app is minimal and has perfect functions. Best part about it is *no ads*. Please do check why the widget isn't functional in android phones without the app itself being open in the multitask pane. That is the only issue, rest is perfect. The widget isn't clickable or accessible unless the app itself is open in the task pane.",
"Task sections with a ""/‚Äù in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",
"App generally works, but it's impossible to include any time or date information in a task name, which is incredibly frustrating. For example, if you want a task that says 'tell family I need the car tomorrow', you're out of luck because 'tomorrow' is not allowed. You can't 'prepare for meeting at 12' either, or any such thing. Very annoying system.",
"The app itself is very good, and doesn't require Premium to actually be your daily task manager. It is great to see developer providing for desktop/iOS too, and all for free. The aforementioned calendar integration should be done through the web page or desktop (not the mobile app). It works just as advertised, but instead of a ""timeline"" with tasks it's the tasks window with calendar events/tasks. So, works really well, just maybe isn't for me. An exemplary simple app.",
"I love the depth of customization in this app! I can do so much in it! I love it so much! Thank you for creating this. I only have one suggestion and that is to view completed task in each labels/filters in that day, week, or month. The current completed tasks shows it each day and it can be messy. It would be lovely to see them categorized. For example, the label is ""gratitude"" it would be nice to see the achieved tasks there which indirectly tells me to be grateful for.",
"I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!",
"I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è, this makes my day exciting, the satisfaction of marking done on the app after completing a task is on next level. The UI and everything is so good in this app. I reduced one point because there are no many options to snooze tasks when they pop in the notification area, rather here in this app we need to pick one snooze time from the settings and it sticks with all the tasks. To the Developer: Please fix this by giving multiple snooze options directly in the notification area.",
"Simple to use but superior functionality & UI - best app for staying organized across all devices. Unbeatable for getting things done at the right time, especially when used with Pomodone app. Anyone who doesn't pay the small annual subscription isn't serious about their own success, and is unappreciative of what the Todoist team have achieved. Support these people!",
"This app is as useless as Google Tasks which doesn't send any notifications to remind me of the tasks it asks me to pay for it to send notifications, useless.",
"I liked the simplicity of this app. It does lists with tasks and sub-tasks with our without due dates and that's all I really want it to do. It doesn't try and complicate things, it syncs simply with my PC and laptop and doesn't bother me with annoying notifications.",
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.",
"The sub tasks are really a great help in organizing thoughts and tasks. I also love the Projects section! It gives me the freedom to just dump all the stuff in my head, allowing me to have a space for other stuff to think about. My mindspace is feeling a lot freer than ever before, the simple reminder apps just don't work for me. I like the Karma feature too!",
"So far so good. Looks good, easy to use. I am still learning and haven't worked out how to set up templates. Great reminders to email - which is very useful. Love how I can reschedule to the next day if I havent completed the daily todoist list. Notes section on daily task is very useful.",
This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.,
"The app is too complicated and has too many features that are not intuitive or user-friendly,too expensive and requires a premium subscription to access most features1too buggy and has sync issues, data loss, crashes, and glitches,The app is too restrictive and does not allow users to customize their tasks, projects, or labelsThe app is too slow and consumes a lot of battery and memory",
"I like it.its simple and has most features i use daily such as boards which are buggy tho. Id really like a separate calander feature to assign each todo to a certain time with different views of either day, week, month. Would be useful to know when to do this task since the current schedule feature is uncomfortable to use. A note taking feature would be a life saver tbh and adjusting the width of sections in board view would be cool. Customizable priorities would make things easier.",
"Update: As a big user of sub-projects, I was disappointed to see their usefulness go when they no longer appeared in the main project. However, I have recently been pleased to notice the new ""Sections"" feature now allows me to replicate that functionality, and being able to display them a board is a nice touch. I also appreciate how the functionality of the Wear OS app has come along when other developers have been dropping watch support.",
"Well, i thought it's the best in the market as they clearly have 13yrs of experience now but i was wrong. I so wanted to avoid that (Ticktick) app but there's no alternate to it. Pros - Amazing sync & interface Cons - pricy, no calendar view or sync available within the app (like ticktick), no habit tracker.",
"I read that users complain that the functions are too limited in the free version. I used the free version only so far and i can't complain. Adding notes, links and labels is sth that works only in the premium version (and would be nice to have) but the free version is fully functional. i enjoy it a lot!",
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.",
Downloaded today and the app generates an error when I try to create an account. Not a great sign!,
"I've looked hard at many to-do apps and Google Tasks & Reminders. I think Todoist is the best of them all, and easily worth the small subscription fee. Custom filters and the Android home screen widget are a great combination. I do wish for a minor UI fix for the widget, but no other to-do app comes close!",
"todoist is the best I've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later, while syncing with Google calendar. Unfortunately, it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries, especially those that repeat -don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event!",
"Usually this is a great tool. The widget is very well designed and helps me stay organized. Unfortunately, the software has been crashing since the most recent update. This makes rearranging and organizing my day very difficult. I use a Motorola, so it may just be an issue with my type of phone.",
"Completely spamming my calendar with recurring tasks that I never created. Update: Yes I connected to my google calendar. Then your auto generated recurring tasks like ""review the day and plan ahead"" were filling every day of my calendar. It was a total mess. I had to carefully go over every task in todoist and had to remove the due date, then save, then delete the task. Because just deleting didnt work because they reapperad the next day. Now I deleted the integration which solved the issue.",
"This is the only app I use for my time and activities management because it does everything I want and need. For example, it's extremely important for me to be able to track my past appointments as well as accomplishments. Other apps I have used in the past did not keep such an easily retrievable archive. When you get to be my age, remembering past doctor and dentist appointments as well as recording important notes about them is invaluable. I gladly pay for the premium upgrade; well worth it!",
You need to purchase an upgrade for it to be at all useful.,
"Love the smart interpretation of list items, correctly identified dates, repeats, etc. Available on multiple platforms. No annoying adds or push to premium subscription. Integration with Google calendar is really useful. Better suited to tasks tracking than groceries lists, I would say. Easily recommended.",
"Constant bugs - breaks functionality or UX that worked previously. For example, reordering tasks flickers for a second while it's updated to and from the server. Last update for disabling reordering of tasks while they're ordered by priority made the app unusable for me. Almost every time everyone adds the tasks of urgent priority (don't we? ;)) And it's very hard to order it to be in the top in case you have like 50 tasks in the list...",
"Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone",
"I generally love this app. It's quick and easy to use. Looks good too. I just wish you could make the widget smaller. I'd like to have two widgets next to each other, one for today and one inbox (I know you can switch what you see, but I forget that and would love to be able to have a widget for each without having to take up more than half of my screen). I would also love if Google calendar could be seen in todoist too & not just todoist in Google calendar.",
"Can't share in typical fashion. Can't easily flip through attachments. 1. No share menu option on item-level. Android design pattern users expect ""Share"" item. Share to Google Photos' Share button great example. App MixNote's great Share example: popup ""Share by text"" or ""Share by picture"". Your ""Add reaction, Copy, Edit, Delete"" isn't cutting it. 2. Attachments, ugh. Can't just swipe through item attachments. Have to back out of view, select next photo to view. Yuck. MixNote does right, IMO.",
Integration with Google assistant is pathetically bad even when it works. It stopped working completely after a couple of kludgy weeks. Customer service never figured out the problem and I stopped using todoist in favor of anylist which integrates seamlessly with assistant. Prepaid todoist annual plan and basically never used it.,
"Great experience so far. Only wish that the subtasks remain in the main task and does not show up in all task list with no due date. And a calander view would be nice. Shifted fr Ticktick to this one, and working out fine so far. However my really important notes (comments) suddenly disappeared. This I'm quitting the app. This is really critical and disappointing",
"It was working before and now things have moved around and I have to figure out how to use the app again... Productivity apps aren't supposed to slow you down! I preferred the hamburger menu being a swipe in from the left, it didn't take up space at the bottom of the screen before. Also had to uninstall and reinstall because GCal sync wasn't working and the whole app just showed a spinning circle.",
"I LOVE the new widget! It's finally useful! Please let us change the time when the day changes... For example, I go to bed at around 3AM. I consider any time before that to still be the technically previous day. That completely messes up tasks that repeat after completion...",
"Enjoying this app so far, it offers more sorting and organization options and easier due date editing than Google Tasks, which is what I used before. I like how seamless it is to move items to different projects and dates. However, I wish there were more options to see my completed tasks, though: at least an option to show the tasks I completed this week or today... It means a lot to me able to see my completed tasks (I like to SEE my productivity without having to dig for it).",
"great tool to track my tasks and activities. I can read from any place my tasks and they are synchronized even with my outlook. Private or business tasks are so easy to track. I tried different apps before, but really, there is nothing that is better than Todoist. This app has a lot of features and it continues to be improved. üëç Good job to all the team and developers!",
I have to say that I completely love this task manager app (it's a winner above all the others that I tried mainly because you can set subtasks and sub-subtasks almost indefinitely). I have an idea of a feature that could make it even better (nothing groundbreaking though. I would like to be able to set percentual progress in any given task based on my own subjective estimation (so basically I could decide to make the progress on a task 50% or 20%). Keep up the good work,
"Been using this app for long time now. Almost bought the premium version twice :P but the cost is too high. Great UI feels great to use the app. By far the only app which has solved recurring tasks use cases properly (beats Google Tasks). Only complaint is in ""Today"", when I have overdue, I would like to have an option to either see today first or overdue first. I always get overdue first, it made sense previously, but now that i have a lot of overdue, i dont want to miss out on today's tasks, its like paying penalty twice (paid once for having the task in overdue and missing out on my today's tasks). Reminders should have been in free version (this has caused me to look for other apps and will slowly deprecate this app on my phone). Overall a great app. Kudos to the team.",
"Downloaded this app in the year of 2020 and I gotta say, this app is exceptional when it comes to jotting down tasks, planning events, and creating projects for bussinesses. Never in my life have I seen such brillance in design and organization, all in one tiny icon! Keep up the good work, developers of this amazing app!",
definitely keeps me on top of my tasks and helps me feel as if I'm being productive. the way you can categorize and prioritize tasks according to your goals and projects definitely helps me stay on track and focus on what I want to focus on at certain times. the only con is that the constant updates makes it hard to keep up with how the interface works and I'm constantly having to learn where things have been moved to.,
"Literally just started using this app and really like it so far, it's pretty easy to use, but I wish there were more options for making tasks due. Specifically, being able to make something due ""every 2 days"" or ""once a week"" without having to pick a particular day would be *very* helpful.",
Push notifications don't work on my phone at all. What's the point of having a to-do list app if it doesn't send notifications when something is due? Permissions have been granted. My phone is not on battery saver or do not disturb mode. Notifications simply don't work.,
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it.",
"I really like the structure of the app. I was looking for something that would reinforce deadlines and having the widget on my homescreen, and the fact that it doesnt get rid of overdue assignments helps me so much. Edit: the suggestion helped! Thank you!! [the widget didn't update the day / what is due today unless I open the app or the widget settings]",
"So I have been hoping around in the Todolist apps for a while now, and I think I might have a winner, Todoist is a clean and simple app to use, I like the fact that it can go in the notification shade, makes it much easier to set reminders and tasks for yourself! Thank you for a great Todolist experience!!!",
"For me the widget is the biggest strength. You can custom it to blend with the background. You can see your upcoming week easily (+ today) . You can create a task in one tap and add a date just by mentioning it (ex: tomorrow, in 3 days, every Sunday at 2pm etc). Everything is fast, simple, clear. And you can also add text and images to a task.",
"Todoist has been a big help for me getting organized and I love using it. Unfortunately I can only give it three starts due to a problem I've been having for months now. Long story short, my weekly streak doesn't reset when I fail to meet my weekly goal. I've contacted their customer support team twice since the problem started and both times I was told they were checking with the dev team followed by silence. No explanation or solution.",
"I love this app, *but* with the disclaimer that I don't like how it syncs with google calendar. When I synced it, ALL of my todoist entries showed up as calendar events, making it impossible to use my calendar. And, I couldn't un-sync it. So I ended up having to completely delete that todoist account and make a new one with a different email. That was some time ago (two years?) So it's possible the sync function is improved.",
"Not able to witness due date for repeat tasks in the latest update. I use the app on my iPad and my Android phone and didn't face any such issues until the latest update. Given that I use a daily checklist, the dates on each item are usually displayed below the task. I now have to manually click on each task in the Android app to see if I'd checked them off. Please fix this immediately.",
"They improved the App on PC since last time I tried it (like 4 years ago or something) and I can say I'm glad I downloaded it back. Free Version is good if you don't need to track many projects, and the subscribtion is a fair price that I might pay in the future if I need it. Highly recommended",
"Great app, very helpful for me. I have a very mentally demanading job and have to keep alot of tasks organized. Todoist help me keep everything in order so I dont forget anything. However, I'm using it on my Samsung Note 10 plus. I've done some research and I'm being told that android will not sync to the Google calendar. I just have the free app on my phone, and know I can still use it with the dex, but if there is a way I can sync it to Google calendar please let me know.",
"It is a lot of fun. I used to use the memo's app that came with my phone but that took a lot of designing. I liked it because it was digital and I could easily erase it. This has a comments section, cute icons, you can set dates and times and get email updates on your projects. You can also create projects and color code. I am getting so much accomplished with this app. I absolutely love it!!!",
"App is really good; very helpful for listing my recurring and non recurring tasks. But looks like an ordinary task when being made a recurring one, the key words dont work. Also, request you to bring in more motivational cues like stickers or display points achieves on a daily basis.",
Terrific! Couple of things: 1. If your choice is to sort your list by Date - it should do this automatically when adding a task (instead of having to select Sort -> Date each time). 2. For the Widget it would be nice if you could have a little coloured circlet/dot next to the Project name (as it shown within the app itself).,
"This app is absolutely amazing. I'm a STEM college student at UC Santa Barbara, so I have a lot of homework, studying, and places to go in a day and I've been looking for a good to do list app for a while and this hit the jackpot! Even without the premium you can label your list and that is extremely helpful. I highly recommend this app if you need to sort out things in your day :)",
"Great app ,it just worked very well for my personal needs, even in the Free plan, Great work üòç‚ù§Ô∏è Edit: There is one issue, the reminder is not in the free plan and I think this is a must have feature in to-do list app so please consider this. Edit2: I was able to fix the reminders issue by linking my account with Google Calendar, and then using Google Calendar reminders for free. so for me now the app is really great even in the free plan.",
"Commit to it. It is amazing. I don't know all of its uses but it works for me and easy, quick, and smooth.",
"This app has been great for synchronising our chores and lists in the family, but wince several updates ago the process of completing checklists is completely unusable. The app re-renders several times every time you mark an item as completed. We have been unable to use it since, as it's way too slow.",
"This app has a cookie-cutter UI so it at least looks nice, but they put the same amount of effort into the app's functionality. They even cover some buttons with popups that you can't dismiss. I can't believe I paid $36 for this. The reminders feature is cuttered and they clearly put very little thought into UX. I just want a refund.",
"Wunderlist was Waaay better. Too bad that one got bought out. I need an app that syncs to another phone, and that let's me organize things the way I need them. This app is okay, but they reserve a lot of features for the paid version (subscription required). Not gonna happen. I've used this app for several months, but I'm done.",
Todoist really arranges my life for now and the fact the basics are free is what made me rate it in the first place. This is absolutely gorgeous and I really like the facts the premium stuff is extra additions to the free basic needs which allows broke people to still use it and be satisfied. I think that I will upgrade to premium at some point because of the good quality app and the fact that the basics are completely free. Not all companies do that; I would rate it 10 stars if I can.,
"I love todoist.... I have stuck with this software longer than its competitors. I gave it 4 stars because I want more themes( nature, full dark mode themes, more colors like even soft pinks, lavender, powder blue) I would love an alarm on my tasks because reminders just dont catch my attention. I would love to be able to make list with checkboxes or numbers in comments on a task. I wish this app had a timer on each task as well. I love this app.",
"This app has completely changed my life. I want to thank everyone who is somehow connect with To-Do List. It works like a game and seeing your progress makes you work even harder)) Besides, it doesn't take as much time (and paper, which is also important) as a bullet journal, so it's easier to stick to this and make the app a part of your routine.",
"Widget options are very minimal. Doesn't allow pulling in calendar events, so you'll still need to manage those obligations in another app. Subtasks on recurring tasks behave in a disconnected way in that you have to set up their recurrence separately and it can easily get out of sync. Date/recurrence input is unintuitive.",
"As of version 8602, all the issues I was having with crashes, duplicating items, and the Add Task button in sectioned lists have been resolved. App works great now. Not a huge fan of the bar on the bottom instead of top, but it's not a big enough issue to knock a star off.",
"The latest update adds an extra step to switching to a filter. Normally clicking deeper into more menus is only mildly inconvenient, but after 2 years, there is still no real kanban view. I need a todo app that saves time, not becomes a time consuming activity in itself.",
"EDIT: Changing to 5 stars, turns out you can set up gCalendar sync, you just have to do it via the web client. Original review: brilliant app, very customizable and also can be synced with other devices and has a browser extension. my only gripe is that it desperately needs calendar integration so you could sync events with your Google calendar. besides that, amazing app.",
"An awesome app with lots of integrations. The only feature I'm missing is the ability to set a permanent order (when I have the tasks sorted and then add another one, it ends up on the bottom and I have to press the sort button again)",
"I'll always miss Wunderlist, but I'm very grateful that I found Todoist! üëå My only problem is that I keep exiting the app when I try to go ""back"" a page after entering a task. Am I missing something, or do I have to get used to it? ü•¥ Reply to developer:Thanks for responding! I usually hit the home button to leave, but when I want to truly kill/exit other apps, I go ""back"" from the *main* page. I see the page that lists all projects as main. It's the top of the tree & has the settings gear.",
Such an easy to use yet effective app! I've burnrd through so many organisers and planners over the years but have finally found something that works for me! The free version gives you everthting you need to get started and I've been making progress on personal projects like never before! Helps you set realistic goals and not to try to achieve too much in one sitting. Would recommend!,
"I'm pretty sure I have two accounts, one through apple and one through google play. i tried to follow the instructions to deactivate one and I'm missing the button that's described in the how-to. I've reached out for help with no avail. I'll probably cancel both accounts. Two starts for lousy customer support on a decent product. UPDATE TO ONE STAR FOR NO REFUND UPON CANCELING.",
"Buggy, unusable, lost all my work. On each run it showed me a different list, even duplicated stuff. When I deleted a list it duplicated, it also deleted the other one, which made me lose a lot of time. Learn to code!",
"It's an effective Todo list manager, but for some reason the widget won't display anything, just an empty list. This has been a common issue with most Todo list widgets I've tried, though. So the problem is most likely with the phone. Any insight would be appreciated",
"I love this app and use it mainly for a to-do list/remember this list. The only problem that I have experienced is, it's quite sensitive. When I mistakenly touch something and it deletes, it is gone. Sometimes it happened so quickly I don't even know what I just deleted. I wish there was a ""deleted files box"" that it went to so that I could restore that which I mistakenly deleted, which could be emptied later at my decision. Other than that, it is a wonderful program and I do recommend it.",
"it's an app that allows me to make a task repeat itself without paying up, that's already a bonus.",
"I am extremeky disappointed with this app.  I lost a lot of information with the last upgrade.  Now, i am wasting time constantly updating this app.  I am currently looking at other applications.  If your improvements risk functionality,  it is not worth it.  It makes me believe that your designers and programmers do not actually use the app. I use the app for health issues like medicine times.  Could have been very detrimental.",
"What is point of giving the trial if you can not try the most basic features! If users schedule a task and leave the app, they will not even get the notification of the due task. User can only unlock this by having pro version of the app. One more thing for the UX team, there is just a single difference between a reminder and a notification (alert). And this app not even give you a alert in the trial version.",
"The interface for rescheduling tasks is terrible and the signup process is so frictionless that it's actually not very secure (easy to create fraudulent accounts under someone else's email). That said, the app is very good at what it does, which is organizing your tasks, projects, and lists.",
"I've tried several organization apps. Most of them were fine, but they would always be missing a feature I needed when something came up and would get me off track. Todoist is so versatile with its features that I can figure out how to put these situations into my schedule without changing the whole system. Keep it up!",
It's really awesome for organizing and scheduling things! I loooove it! Also it lets you plan stuff daily weekly monthly are even yearly. Really awesome. The only thing that is lacking is a weekly calendar viewing or something to keep your week more organized and have a better arregement if your tasks. There is that last star.,
"I wanted the ability to create project, and categorized to-do lists, and this app works perfectly. I really like the home screen widget, and when I've had questions about how to use certain features (i.e. setting a recurring task) a quick Google turns up helpful results.",
"It is an extraordinarily designed app. However the subscription price is high. Please reduce the price so that more & more people can enroll Please add the option to have ""end time"" for each task, I mean the ""From"" and ""To"" time for each task. Also the unfinished tasks of ""Yesterday"" can automatically come to ""Today"" since tasks showing in yesterday's list does not make sense. Reducing one star for this. Once these changes are done, I will surely re-rate as 5 stars. Thanks..You guys Rock!!",
"Best part is: It understands pseudo language and we can easily manage our todos through drag-drop, labels, priorities, project, auto and custom reminders etc...  Everything seems perfect and very easy except few things:  It lacks time tracking, motivation, easy individual todo and project progress, AI to schedule the day according to our todos.  It offers various time tracking integrations but none of them support other platform than web and even if some integration would support mobile platform, we will have to keep multiple apps for single purpose!  Looking forward to see time tracking and progress for both individual and group todos!  Kudos to Team!  Best Regards, Sagar",
"Was pleasantly surprised with nice UI and ability to add and organize tasks. Got everything moved over from G Tasks and set to use Todoist. That was until I was waiting for a reminder to notify me a task is due. A notification of a task due is an integral part of task management. Unfortunately you must purchase the premium version for this to work, which in my opinion makes this app completely unusable.",
"Badly needs an alarm as a notification option. I keep missing tasks with the current status bar notifications all the time. For such a well designed app, I find the exclusion of such a simple feature surprising. Other apps have it, and it's almost making me consider leaving Todoist for them.",
"Please revert to your old version & interface! The new widget has made the app completely unusable. It used to be my favorite task management app and now I'm searching for alternatives, on the verge of uninstalling it! P.S. Please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself, when you add a new task. I have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date.",
"This app has replaced my chaotic stream of notebooks, carted around in my various bags until their covers fall off and I no longer know where to find anything. I upgraded to the premium version after using the trial month and never regret it. In addition to syncing with my GCal, I have the tab pinned in my browser so I can organize and share notes across my phone and computer with ease. At the day job we use Asana, but Todoist is my choice for both personal projects/hobbies and freelance work.",
It's great! Honestly the best project management tool that I've been lucky enough to find. That being said I do have one gripe. I can not for the life of me figure out where an up to date list of free and premium features are. It says that 80 projects are supported in free(total overkill but hey) I got stopped at five. How many are in premium? Does the alert work in premium? Gcal sync by labels? Edit: good info in reply. Upped stars to 5/5 from 4. Rest of review unchanged.,
"One of the best personal or business task management apps for mobile or desktop use. Paid version is inexpensive for the value. Extensive integrations through such platforms as IFTTT. Very versatile. Very easy to use. While I regularly evaluate most others on the market, this is among the top five. And for the last 4 months, it's my go-to app for personal and various small businesses with up to five other collaborators. A simple calendar within the app is the only feature missing.",
"Subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous. I was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app, but having to pay nearly $5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd. Once I saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall, I had to stop using it",
"Whenever the app get cleared out of the RAM and I try to open it, it just crashes and then works fine. Also I wish reminders was a thing for free users as well. To get access to that one feature (Atleast that's what I'll use) paying for such a heavy subscription just doesn't make sense to me. Great tasks app otherwise",
"Good app, could be truly great if one more thing was baked in. Imagine if there was a difference between true due dates for tasks and planned dates for finishing them by. I'm envisioning features similar to Trello where you can drag and drop tasks with due dates onto a planning board calendar. This would be excellent for any college students with hectic assignment and exam schedules, or those simply trying to get ahead in their work.",
"It's so confusing. Why does my keyboard stay up so randomly when adding a task? On some forms you can't hide it, on others you can but it's shown by default even when no text field accepts input. And why can't I choose a period for a task and instead I have to type it? The app really lacks integrity.",
"Thank you for adding the ability to make strikethoughs on mobile via markdown. Much appreciated! üíú But, after the newest task view update, everything is just too big/overwhelming for me. I like things more compact(?) sometimes, and the layout before the update was perfect for my needs. Maybe a Settings feature for those who worked best w/ older, less ""streamlined"" Todoist layouts to switch between (or alt. layout modes‚Äîthink a ""compact mode"" like how Discord & Gmail do it) would be best? üò¢",
"This handled tasks exactly as expected. Due dates sort into categories, with overdue tasks exposed as well (a simple thing that Microsoft To Do continues to botch). The best replacement for Wunderlist, even if you have to pay for access to simple things like comments and reminders (worth $5/yr at most, but I'll pay the extra to avoid the UX issues in other apps... for now)",
"It's excellent except for a really significant flaw. The option to complete recurrent tasks infinitely and not be able to reset them is frankly a terrible, terrible idea. I now have 50 tasks completed in the first day! Accidentally. Please, please, please fix it, I beg you",
"It is the only app I have found that integrates 2way with Google calendar. With this, tasks can show up as events in my calendar and I can edit them in both apps. Apart from that, it has many great useful features that I regularly use, such as: categorizing tasks (project level as well as section level), prioritizing tasks, sub tasks, comments within tasks. A minor complain would be that you can't move around multiple tasks at once and that there is no native Linux app.",
"I don't write reviews. However, when Todoist, my most used App prompted me for the first time to rate them, how could I say no? This app has basically changed my life, giving me an outlet to bettet manage my schedule and my time in a simple, yet effective manner. Personally, I do not use the more complex tools like ""Projects"" but, even for the free users (I'm one) this is a wondeful tool. My favorite feature is the ability to flag different priority levels for different assignments.",
"One of the best Todo list app on the play Store. I use it daily for my School, work, appointments and personal tasks. It works perfectly no bugs disturbing ads, the app is easy to use even if you are a beginner. What I wish to see is a better ui design that makes the app not great but perfect the app does look a little bit old so a new theme would be amazing and I would really love to see an option to sync the Samsung Calender with this app. Spacial Thanks for the developer and the whole Team.",
pretty good if you can do all the things you put on it,
It's a good app but ever since yesterday the app will open but kicks me out.,
"I love this app! I can't believe how powerful it is. A little learning curve, but after that, it's also quite easy to use. Suggestion: certain tasks I want to do every day, but they're not important. I would love a separate widget for repeating tasks without seeing them on my daily (and not seeing the ones due tomorrow in project view) ya know? P.s. as someone with severe adhd, highly recommend, esp if you like Routinery",
"I had been using tasks in Microsoft Outlook, as well as in my case management software. But found them not very effective in helping me achieve task completion. Then I was recommended Todoist. Todoist has been a game changer. It has a unique approach to task creation, follow-up and completion, that is effective and motivates one to actually get the task done. I also love the fact that it focuses on one thing and 1 thing only: tasking. And by doing so it is extremely effective at it.",
"I like this app, it has helped me organize my day",
"The best project management app I've ever used! I have used many different apps and methods to help organize my life. But when I found ToDoist, it had everything I needed and then some. Their help articles and support are the best so it's easy to get started; and they are constantly coming up with new features to make the app better. The free version has all the necessary features for the average user and the premium version is cheap compared to other project management apps. I highly recommend.",
"LOVE IT. as someone who is all about organising things and checklists, this app is really the best thing for productivity. And most of all, my mental health. :) And it's so intuitive, very easy to use and sort things out - and design of it all, is also another favourite thing of mine.",
A basic feature like reminders is paid.,
"Great app, gets the job done and helps organize assignments, only thing that I would like would be if the widget had rounded corners and maybe have an option for a sort of blur background to make the widget look more modern and appealing. Everything works perfectly, definitely recommend.",
"Kept getting ""an unknown error has occurred, please try again later"" .... Tried on several devices on my T3 connection, had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one. Uninstalled. Sad cuz it looked great. In re: dev's reply, yes I did that. I made sure it was plugged in and turned on too. I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks.",
"Im a notorious list jumper (always trying to find the best app for managing my to dos) and ive been using todoist for over 2 years. The only downside for me is a lack of dependent tasks and id really like to see it incorporated in the future, along with ""hide until"" or "" start dates"" both available in other apps and would increase the clean interface for those that care to use them. despite that, still the best app out there. Kudos as well for keeping accessibility in mind during development",
"App is quite good overall and I use it everyday. Reminders shouldn't be a pro feature, but I guess they have to make money. Biggest issue is general bugginess. Latest update means I can't add tasks to any section in sectioned view. ""Add task"" button does nothing. The only way to add a task is the hold and drag the ""add task"" button into the list above, then you can add a new task. Very buggy though, please fix.",
"This is a great app, and I love it, bit I have two small issues with it. First, I don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks. Second, I wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in. Since fixing one would fix both, this is still a great app",
"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?",
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list....",
"Great app, very mature and scalable. You can use it any way, as simple it as complex as you need to, any type of custom workflow can be built via Todoist. I've came from Evernote in August 2022, and instantly realized what I've been missing in terms of tasks functionality. I subscribed to premium plan on day 1.",
"This app has been life changing. I'm more productive than I've ever been, and feel less stressed and on top of things. The app is reasonably intuitive, and I picked it up really quickly. I'm considering springing for the premium features as a lot is locked out in the free version, but I feel like it will be worth it.",
"I gave this app a 2nd try after it not working well for me the first time, and it's been awesome. I actually pay for the $2/month premium now so I can make more lists and projects since I use it so much now. I have ADHD, so organization and sticking with a system for longer than the initial ""new and shiny"" stage has been a big challenge--it still is, but using Todoist along with my paper planner has helped me be a more reliable human. Recommend giving it a try!",
"I've tried a dozen+ task list apps in the last few days (and many before that), looking for certain features. I don't know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it (no ""skip login"" option). Nowhere did I see the creators/reviews say an account is required even for starting/basic use. One star: non-web, non-collab, non-premium features should be accessible without account. Then I finally read 1- star reviews, now glad I didn't sign up: apparently the spam emails never cease.",
Really helps keep me accountable. Overall a great organizational tool. Better than calendars alone and other platforms like Trello or similar. Would be great if they had templates to choose from or tutorials on how to set up projects. Luckily I have PM experience and was able to map it out.,
"They have a premium version for $4 a month!!! REALLY?? Why don't you offer a FREE TRIAL?? Apps that have a ""Premium"" version you can't try until paying is shady and tells me, clearly hiding something. I'm guessing it's not worth price and you'll find that out with a trial, so they don't offer it. Uninstalling!! Way too many similar apps for free or cheaper paid version.",
"LOL greedy app devs. They charge $36 annually or $48 if you select the monthly option. If you get the premium version, it'll allow you to receive push-notifications for a scheduled task. Like, to set a timer / alert for something on your list. Uninstalled. For $40, the app better be making you breakfast in the morning.",
"This app (and Google add-on) is amazing, even the free version. However, the new widget is worse than the old one. One major reason I say that is because the old version allowed overdue tasks to be rescheduled with a single touch. In this new one, so far, you have to go back into the app.",
Once again you've made this worse by redesigning the widget. It was fine as it was. Now I can't select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item. If this carries on I'm definitely not renewing my subscription. Please restore,
I run multiple businesses and so far this has helped me organize my days tremendously. A lot of initial decisions had to be made about where I want things and that took a while but now I'm really glad I took the time to do it because it's all coming together and actually relieving some stress. Hopefully I can come back and add the 5th star after I've had more time using it!,
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it",
"I've been a Pro user for a while and Todoist is almost perfect for me as it's really fast and easy to add tasks and keep track of everything, however- the fact that I can't rearrange tasks in the Today tab as I wish is almost a deal-breaker to me. Some tasks may have time or priority set and I would still need to move something above them and I can't. The possibility of manual rearrange overwriting time and priority is necessary. I already sent a feedback and I hope you'll implement this",
"I don't always write reviews, but when I do, I really love the product. Todoist just send a newsletter that they providing amazing new features to the free version. I took the time to write what I love about their product on the survey, I thought it would be good to share it here as well but apparently 500 signs are the limit and I wrote.. A lot. So I will have it shortened. Todoist made my life a better one. 'It feels like I forgot something', well that's a thought of the past. Thanks guys!",
I am beginning to discover the power of this app. Keep finding hidden gems of good ways to organize and track what's important. Love the extensive integration. There's lots of good tips and examples which help immensely. I like the natural language scheduling feature. Easy to move things around to fit. Pretty awesome.,
"Love this app! It really helps me with the long list of things I have to do daily. It also has features that allow you to keep a certain task on loop which saves time. I love the little side projects that you can add on to help you keep track of things, it would be good to be able to write lists in those instead of just tasks to tick off.",
"3.5 stars out of 5. This is so far the better of the 5 to do list's I've tried. Make setting/linking tasks easier and more seamlessly synced with the rest of the list. Make it possible to like with my calendar and alert of of schedule conflicts, allow me to send task collaboration invites to others via text or email and be able to coordinate with other tourist users on joint tasks, finally a place holder for brainstormed tasks that I'll prioritize at a later date. This will make it a 5 star app",
"Only the best action tracking app ever. Simple and effective. The mobile version is great, and allows for on the go thought/action collection. I use this in conjunction with the web app on my laptop. The mobile and web app are both intuitive and stable.",
"Far too invasive in terms of notifications and company ads on your phone, and worse on the email address you register when creating a todoist account.. And that continues EVEN after uninstalling the app from my phone! Yes it's a multi device app but then one should have the option to uninstall your whole setup on all devices and your registration account Totally fed up from that from most of the apps you can install on your phone...",
"Life changer. Love being able to make nested subtasks and being able to assign dates to them! Web app, and windows app work incredible well and feel native. Great Google Assistant integration, but wish it was default for reminders which is probably something Google needs to do to support it. Only complaint is wish task descriptions were free but pricing plans are quite reasonable.",
"I didn't even get to use this app because ""reminders are a premium feature"". Anything to exploit money out of people. Basic functions of a planner shouldn't be a ""premium paid feature"". You want fancy backgrounds or other personalization? Charge for it. Special notification sounds? Charge for it. But a simple reminder (the whole point of a freaking planner) should be free.",
"Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.",
"I use this for GTD. On the premium version and I think the best benefit is file attachments, but the price still feels a bit high. Reminders being a premium feature is silly tho. My main gripe right is now is the difficulty in deleting completed tasks, you have to do them one at a time üôÉ",
"It's free, and even without a paid subscription, you get a lot of helpful qualities, like easy organization and reminders to complete tasks or projects. The only reason I didn't give a fifth star is, you can't ask for reminders on certain days of the week, like every Tuesday and Thursday at noon or something. You can only do one day a week, or daily, or every other day reminders of tasks. Other than that, I would highly recommend it. I'm using it to organize my homework. üëç",
"It has a nice layout and I enjoy how you can separate tasks into projects and sub-tasks. My main gripe is that the task has to have a set date, instead of just 'x times a week'. And I can't make recurrent tasks, instead writing a new task when the other is finished.",
"App is great so far. Only used it for a little bit and I'm trying it imout but I'm very happy with how It understands language terms like ""clean dishes on Friday"" and it sets it for you on Friday and gives you a reminder that it's coming up. I noticed that when I tried to re-arange sub tasks in my boards it glitches and closes the app. Maybe this is something you guys can take a look into. It's not a huge deal for me. I still love the app so far.",
"EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS APP IS AWESOME! I love to be busy, and this app helps me so it. I love that it instantly syncs between my phone and my laptop, and it even had a browser extension. This Android app is fully featured with everything a good app should have; it's all implemented really well. Drag operations feel natural and the design looks good. I love the colors and the ability to color code my tasks/projects. This app was clearly built by passionate developers for engaged people!",
"I love this app, use it on a daily basis to keep track of everything and sync it with my calendar. For me a todo app like this is essential for getting things done, and I'm yet to find a better one than this. Premium version adds a lot of features, especially for business and collaboration, but you can easily get by with the free version. Highly recommend.",
"Very good, I've been using this app a long time to manage my tasks and keep track of lists. I have one issue with one of the recent update and that the change to the today widget. Previously was able to mark off tasks directly through the widget. Now if I click on a task it opens a little popup and then I can check off the task. The purpose of having the widget was to minimize the number steps. Why was this a decision made?",
"Love the lables(only on premium). Like that it works with Google assistant. Would like it if it integrated the functions of the Spen from note9... Be able to jot down nots and view them, as well as attachements, in the list instead of having to open up the list first.",
"I have tried many to do list apps out there, but this one seems to fit my needs, most of it anyways. The only gripe I have with this app is that it's not integrated properly with good assistant. So if I am busy or driving and want to add a task, I end up using Google reminder. But it could be Google's problem as well. All in all its good.",
"Using the free service: Nice simple app with easy sharing capabilities. I wish there was an easier way to umbrella small projects under large ones without having to share a whole bunch of individual projects. Not a perfect match for my needs, buy very adaptable.",
"I like how easy it is to use ToDoist. The UI is intuitive, options are lean, but useful, and this app encourages me to get things done. it would be nice to have a rich text editor for tasks, rather than one line, and other options to change the colors/font of the app. maybe those exist in the paid version?",
"The whole point of a to do list is to remind you to get things done with the help of a numeric badge count. Since they can't be bothered to add this feature, the app, is useless to me. You just loss a potential lifetime user who would have even paid a subscription to have that one feature. Other apps can offer badge counts through launchers such as Evie. Don't give me the excuse that Android is not developing this feature.",
The update makes no more crash,
"Thanks, all sorted and I'm able to see my lists again :)",
"This app has revamped my traditional to-do list approach. At first it may seem weird but once you get into it, it's great. I just wish that the desktop client would sync properly but other than that issue, the app is great for task management.",
"Great interface and perfect for everything! From school to personal things, this app is great to keep track of your tasks and projects. Also another great thing is that it let's you connect to your laptop and Google Cal, which is efficient üôèüòä Try it out for yourself !",
"My favourite productivity tool ever. I've used it for all my task managing for years now. The app, browser and outlook plugins are all consistent and work perfectly. The support is easy to reach out to and quick to respond. Bought premium after a year of using it and never regretted.",
"I like this app. It is very easy to add new tasks with dates, projects, priority. I love also search, filters, possibility to move with tasks in the list, sharing and integration with Alexa. The best todo list app, which I have tried.",
"This app is really helpful, it helps me a lot in my studies. It gives me reminders to complete my left tasks. We can also set a time for a task as well as priorities for different tasks which is pretty satisfying. I haven't seen any faults so far in todoist.",
"Doesn't meet my needs. I'm looking for a to-do app that allows me to see the tasks on my smart watch, click them done, then restore the tasks. Wanting to create a task list that I'll do repeatedly. I do not want to have to touch my phone. This app doesn't perform in a manner that supports that.",
"If I remember correctly, I have been using todoist for over 5 years now. I really cannot imagine everyday life without it. I keep using the free version, as I find the pricing of the paid version too steep. Still, it does the job very well - if there was one app I'd take on a deserted island in shark infested waters, it'd be todoist. ;-)",
"Sync across devices is pretty much seamless. The interface is awesome. UX in general is very smooth and pleasant. The functionality is sufficient for me in terms of customizabiluty. On the other hand, I don't like some things. 1. Themes available for premium accounts are not outstanding. 2. You can't connect Google calendars from > 1 account. 3. Some of the functionality is only available in the web app. Also, integration with Jira would've been awesome (yes, it's a hint).",
"Nice app, great features, good design, however the pricepoint on the monthly fee is ridiculously high and is a must for core features that any to-do app must do, things like 'reminders' and 'labels'... Would try it out properly if the price was right (like 1/12th of what it is now?) but for now it's a pass.",
"NOT SAFE FOR BUSINESS: Hits maximum of 20 sections per project, even if some are deleted. When hit, nothing stops you from wasting hours of work that will ultimately disappear when you close the app because it's attached to an unsaved heading. This cost me money using it as a tool for brainstorming with a client. Todoist responded to this review before responding to my ticket (#680407). It's been over 2 weeks and there's been no news. Technical & customer support nightmare. There are better apps",
"Great app. Alas, I'm constantly reminded that ""Hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for : ) "". This is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense. Plus hey! Its expensive.",
"It is very easy to use, and it has all the tools I want to manage my tasks. The design is very sleek which I like. And I can even add it to my phone's home screen (Android) as a widget so I could check on my tasks easily everytime I open my phone. I am a very pleased user, thank you Todoist team.",
"Brilliant app. The main driving factor for me is its incredibly clean interface and just how intuitive it is. I've upgraded to the premium version, and I'll never look back. I use this everyday for just about everything, couldn't ask for a better productivity app!",
"This thing makes me productive by default. Its almost addicting. I wouldn't knock out a physical planner just yet. Todoist, from my understanding has only complented any type of schedueling sustem I had and made it more effective by allowing me to fill it up with things I need to get done and want to get done without any sort of complicated U.I. although. Dredful priorities are still dreadful regardless of what you write them on(paper, elctronic, etc..), todoist is definitely an ally.",
"This is fantastic, since i started using this app my life has changed dramatically: i quit drinking, my wife returned to me, even got a raise - the app is a blessing! I could only wish that it had an option for recurring projects, spending my - now amazing - life recomposing the same checklist every week, that's not right.",
"I am colour blind and dyslexic. Not able to read anything. I can't zoom in and I need to pay in order to see the colours better. [update] As I said, I would have to pay the app in order to have the right fonts and colour so I can actually read and make use with it. I've tried WeNote, and it's the app I need, without having to pay premium.",
"the only thing I don't like is all the goal-meeting stuff. but it can be ignored fairly easily. everything works great and is nicely customizable to make it pretty :) and so far, they haven't submitted to our Social Media Overlords, which is nice--no constant demands to share everything I do, say, or think! much appreciated.",
"The best out there, that too for free. I have a suggestion though, I know this app is free and I really like it, but if possible, including charts graphs and a timer option to monitor the time spent would literally blow the roof off. But excellent app anyways.",
"I saw this recommended and tried it. I really like the look of the app's widget. Some of the stuff is free and some is premium. I reviewed bout five task apps, and this came down to the finals but I don't want one of the features I need being behind a subscription. So I will be choosing something I can only pay once. Thanks for allowing trying this app!",
"I wish there was a way you could tell the app how much time is available for tasks in a day (changeable) and that the app. Would assign tasks according to priority given to tasks, allowing also for time assignment. Ie, task 1 has a high priority and takes 30 minutes. Oh and such a pity that you can't sync with your calendar on Android. However, very glad to have found this non linear planning tool.",
"I previously gave 5 stars. New feature forces 1 star. ""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" is TERRIBLE. please allow it as an option or revert! I set up all my stores (Costco, Walmart, etc.) now there is NO WAY TO LOOK AT MY ENTIRE SHOPING LIST!  I know I could drag sub tasks, but... 1. It's too easy to complete the parent task thus completing all child tasks. Not good...  2. Moving tasks from one parent task to another is also very dif",
"Love it. It's intuitive, simple, works and synchronizes across the platforms I use. On a more personal note, it helped me organize myself - I have ADHD and task management always have been a major issue for me. Other apps were too basic or too complicated",
"The Widget has problems I have faced for so long. First is the shortcut Todoist Icon on the widget does not work after a while and it is being consistent. I deleted App and Widget and try again but same problem. 2nd is the widget does not update to the task I put up. I have to manually go to the app and click on 'Inbox' then 'Today' again to get it updated den the same problem will start later on. Other than the widget problem, I love this App and have been using it for a long time now.",
This is a to-do list/reminders app and you have to subscribe to get reminders? Without subscribing you get no push notifications which defeats its purpose of being a to-do list/reminder app. Im immediately going back to TickTick. Their subscription based pro features are genuine for pro users and allow you to receive notifications for tasks.,
"Not a good first impression. Too easy to press a wrong fuction (e.g. check boxes) thinking it initiates a section when it clears the section instead (confetti streams down and section dissapears). No way to undelete. Also, when selecting any ""help"" or ""contact"" info, screen clears and shows, ""Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).""",
I really like this app. Getting to know all the little features that are included in the free version. It has helped me with my productivity as a sales professional and given me more control of task that need to be done daily to often get forgotten. I recommend this to anyone that find using a to do list helpful.,
"This app drains your phone battery. I got this app as I was recommended it by a reddit post however I realised I preferred the traditional method of to do lists. Ultimately, I left it alone and forgot it existed. Since I've had the app in my library it ruined my phone battery. Today I got a notification saying this app was causing battery drainage. Be careful.",
"Makes To-Do Lists fun and easy. It syncs up to the windows/pc version, which is also a great touch. Simple but effective design. Can get a bit annoying with reminders, but that's honestly a good kick for a procrastinator. Has never had bugs/crashed.",
"Its nice when you have someone managing your list for you, and all you have to do is do the work of completing the tasks. Lots of functions that i needed. You can create separate projects and subtasks and color code things. Also it automatically schedules the tasks if you writea due date. All around helpful app. And free!",
I figured this app should be pretty good since its 2019 Editors Choice. However the app lacks basic functionality like reminders unless you pay a monthly subscription price. I probably would've paid a flat one-time unlock price but a monthly subscription for a To-do list app??? What a joke.,
"Rated this app higher in the past. I've been a long time user loyal to this app. That's because I've found it to be a good product. The new update is becoming a problem as the new HUD limits the amount of screen space I have. I have upwards of 10 tasks some days, I use this app religiously. Now with the top and bottom HUD, I can only see about 5-6 tasks at a time. I'll have to use this app less now unless there are changes. They removed the scroll up to hide date function. Unfortunate.",
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.",
"Great app for managing tasks. I use the service for a couple of years but this time I did not like the design interface. It is weird, not match the screen as I would. I prefer the old style. Please doist, change this hud/layout please. It was great!",
"Note: Changing to 5 stars because (a) they responded and (b) they provided a quick fix! Love this app! Original Review: Great app BUT, as one user already noted, the task completion notification lasts entirely too long, blocking the task option buttons until it disappears. Used this app for YEARS and it didn't used to be this way. Again, great app but please fix!",
"Minimal features to force premium purchase. This app advertises itself as a an alternative to Microsoft for people forced to migrate from Wunderlists. Wunderlists was an excellent, fully featured list app with reminders, repeatable tasks, folders to group similar lists, and the ability to share any list with anyone via email or the Wunderlist app. Todoist allowed import from Wunderlist and mostly supported these features until summer 2020 update made every useful feature ONLY be in premium.",
"I've tried em all and this is hands down the best to-do list app out there for me. Easy to use, intuitive, great design, syncs across platforms... it does it all. Definitely one of my ""couldn't live without it"" apps.",
"Edit: Sync issue that could only be solved by logging out and in again. Android App did not notice the sync issue. Faq did not help. Tasks did not show up in activity log. Had to search all new tasks on phone and manually add them again on web app. Not acceptable. Simply brilliant, they put a lot of effort into a quick and smooth user interface (keyboard shortcuts, keywords, date detection) that allow me to implement GTD (almost ;) ) at the speed of my thoughts. Keep up the excellent work!",
"Definitely deserves the title of editor's choice. Amazing app, Could you please add a monthly calendar? I love that it's connected to Google Calendar, but having it's own monthly calendar would be even more useful as I can see exactly when I'm most free this month. A calendar widget would be great as well.",
"A bit inconvenient interface when adding and asigning date to the task. Other than that pretty cool intuitive UI along with minimalistic style. My first choice of todo app, even free version is good enough to keep your plans out of your head but in this app.",
"This app was great, but now in 14.1.0 I can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub-projects and their tasks at once. This is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how I use the app. Why not make this a setting I can change back, OR leave it alone altogether? I will be manually rolling this app back. Thanks for making more work for me guys. SERIOUSLY STUPID ""UPDATE"".",
"just what i needed. Trust the system. Combined with GTD, I now have a reliable method of tracking, organizing, sorting, and ranking the MANY areas of my life that need it. When I show my colleagues how I use Todoist, two things happen. 1. They say ""Ooooo, what app is that? It looks cool"" 2. They then say, ""no wonder you get so much done, you're so organize.""",
"I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
"Very good app but so many bugs present there. For no reason at all my task duplicate multiple times and all of a sudden my 4 daily tasks turn into 16. I dont know if its supposed to do this but the daily tasks im not able to complete it shows twice, one overdue and one for today. If these bugs are fixed ill gladly give a 5 star.",
"Its perfect to organize my todo list. I use it every day. I would buy a premium membership, but the only thing I would actually need would be to create more projects... So I dont think its worth it. Also its very sad that you can unlock more themes, but none of them are black. So when I would buy premium, I would still use the black theme. I dont know why there arent more themes with a dark background.",
So far so good. I like using the app better than the extension on my chromebook. It's a lot easier. It has held me accountable about making sure I'm on task for the day and allows me to set timeframes. Love that! Still learning the app but I'm pretty sure I'll figure out the rest of the features.,
Nice and simple. Works and synchronises well having had nightmare issue with Apple reminders. Thanks also to todoist team‚Äôs response to original review showing me how to view completed tasks! (It‚Äôs not obvious without the link as when you try to search completed tasks you get a pop up saying this only available in Pro so may be an idea to make the pop up more informative) Anyway I love the app!,
"It does exactly what it says on the box and it does it well. Good help documentation guiding you to finding a method that works for you. Both app and website are clean and responsive, and functionally equivalent. Regular updates and comparatively few bugs.",
One of the best to-do lists that I've ever tried. Pros: 1. Task priority arrangement; 2. Intuitive interface; 3. Variety of color schemes; 4. Every task can be arranged to a particular project; 5. Possibility to send/get tasks from other users. Cons: 1. Requires premium subscription to get notifications from the app.,
"This is a great tool to keep track of task lists. I like that it is available on Android and Ubuntu. It is fast, stable and easy to use. I'm reading Atomic Habits and plan to use the tool to track all my tasks. No more google calendar or written to do lists!",
"Recurring monthly payment for no ongoing benefit. I would be happy to pay a one time premium cost for the full version, but charging a monthly payment when there's no added value, well I'm sure they're enjoying the revenue. This one's not for me, friends.",
Really loved the app. The only reason why I'm not using it full time and using the pro version is that I can't filter what tasks go to google calendar. If this is done would be great to have several calendars with different filters like for having several projects in different calendars.,
"Excellent Todo app I was looking for to replace my paper one ü•∞ simple and efficient ! It misses just 1 thing : a quick possibility when creating a new task to automaticaly recreate (or repeat) the same task every day/week/month/year. (For example i'd like to create ""pay electricity - every begining of month"") Then it's perfection !",
"No matter what other apps i try, i keep coming back to Todoist. It has the right amount of flexibility and functionality for my needs. Organizing and tagging is easy and super intuitive. Props to the Todoist team for creating an excellent app experience across all platforms!",
"Seems a good app, but can't use the basic functions without paying for premium. Eg can't have a reminder at a certain time of day without premium. Surely the basic function of a reminder app is reminders on a certain day or time. Premium is ¬£36 so expensive, loads of free alternatives out there.....",
"No ""Undo"" button. I thought this would be a basic feature on any organising app. You can't recover an accidentally deleted task/ project, etc. I accidentally created 2 of everything and had to remove them one at a time. Needs an ""Undo"" button as a basic function.",
"Starting out this app was ok, but then I started noticing how limited this is for the free version. Only 10 projects, and where did my completed tasks go? Those should not disappear until I manually delete them. A week into using this, and the workflow I was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up. These are recurring tasks I do daily. I don't know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for ""daily"", but it's lame!",
"still getting used to it.... to having goals at all really. it's one of the weapons in my new ""Grown-Up-Arsenal‚Ñ¢"". and by gawd, I can't think of a better tool to keep me on track. tons of details to (micro)manage, IF/when you need. share any part of your agenda with teammates. add links, and use natural language to set due dates. automatically update your calendar and vice-versa (grt pwr->grt rspncblty, blahblah). list mode<->storyboard mode. on and on. worth every ¬¢ for premium features too",
"After trying multiple to do list apps I found this one to best suit my needs. Its simple and effective. Unfortunately, it is rediculously buggy when syncing with google chalenders. While Todoist claims 2-way syncing, after multiple attempts my tasks kept getting deleted on Todoist and all of my chalender events on google were also deleted. I now have to waste a couple hours manually re-entering all of my google chalender events and I HOPE I don't miss an important appointment.",
"I live by lists. I've used so many apps, and nothing has the functionality of Todoist - especially for free. Slight learning curve if you want to use it to full capability, but the web site teaches you. Stop looking, you won't find better.",
"Still getting used to the UI of the app and exploring customisation. The main reason I installed this app was to set a daily routine, ways this could be easier for me is: - not having to re-type tasks everyday (not sure if there's an option for this) - having the option to keep a task crossed out/completed in the widget but also shown in the widget without disappearing (greyed/crossed out) If these features exist, that's great, how do I activate them?",
"Why do you get rid of things after making users use to it?? What happened to the press and hold to multi select? Why can't I type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like I was able to before the update. Thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones, or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same",
"I'm new to this application and so just using it for basic reminders and to do lists at the moment ... it seems simple at first, but it's full functionality (not exactly intuitive) is yet to be understood and utilized; and like most things there is a learning curve involved that must be taken into account.",
"Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick.",
"Inability to view all open-ended tasks on widget have the winning edge to one last competing app. Would also love option to check tasks as completed via checkbox to avoid two clicks. Again, as an option. Will likely reevaluate again next year in my next run of shopping apps.",
"Nice task management app...JUST cheap enough to subscribe (I do). I got it because apparently wunderlist was going down the drain, but it doesn't seem to have done...however, this works great, shared lists work nicely and it integrates well with Google Assistant. Well...it does if you go via IFTTT. The 'built in' Google Assistant Todoist interface is beyond awful, totally unusable, hence 4stars not 5. Honestly, if you use this with Google Assistant you HAVE to use IFTTT...I'm a tech guy and I make technology work for me but spending an hour trying to get 'talk to todoist' working for me was not pleasant. So frustrating...its so hard to just add a task to the project you want to add it to. It keeps thinking you're saying 'at task' not 'add task' (why would you say that when talking to a task manager?) and it can't seem to do really simple things without a 10 line conversation.  Comparing it to Wunderlist is a bit unfair since I haven't used Wunderlist for a couple of years, but compared to what I remember, this is cleaner, smoother, works better and is generally a better product. Although, if you're sticking to the free version, Wunderlist lets you do more.",
This app has come a long way in a few years. I have used a lot of task managing apps. Todoist is clean simple and it has actually replaced my whole calendar app I was using. The free version is more than good enough for everyday life managing. Highly recommend giving it a try.,
"Not super intuitive, you definitely have to spend a bit of time navigating it. Also, no function to view all to do's regardless of date; it's either ""today"" or ""future"", but you can't see entire list ranging from past due to future, which would make it easier.",
"I am very happy with this app (also the web version) and I use it daily. I really like the text parsing into project, time etc. What I would appreciate is the ability to add a place to a task and then to have a map with the tasks.",
"This is a fantastic app, and I'm thrilled to have found it. It has all the features I need. I save time every day because manipulating and updating my to do list(s) is SO fast and easy now across all my devices (PCs, Mac, and Android). Highly recommended. Many thanks to the Todoist team!",
"Two things could be improved. 1. There should be a option if I want to view the tasks organized into sub-projects in a project view. (Concerning the last update) 2. The sub-tasks could be better organized. Maybe nested inside the options, just like in Microsoft's task app.",
"Excellent app. Works without any bugs that I've found. Great way to keep on top of things. I use this for work, personal, everything. Removes stress from remembering what to do and when. I can literally throw it in the inbox and forget until my morning breakfast ""organise my day"" routine. 6 stars out of 5. Great app. üòÅüëèüëç",
"Pleasant app to use! The application is very simple and I find it very intuitive. It is quick and easy to create new tasks. Adding time and dates to task is streamlined by using the ""auto-detecting due date feature"" within the app. I am pretty new to using ""to-do""/organization apps, and I find this application as great starter and/or a great addition to tools you already use!",
"it has all the practical features that I need in order to just keep my tasks and projects organized. it is useful and user-friendly. I might go for the premium features if I see the need for them. But even without premium, it is still a very helpful application.",
"Just getting started here, less than a month in. But this app and the cross platform features make a great prosthetic executive function. A little bit of a learning curve to get even this far but the sheer power of this system rewards climbing it. I'm hooked, and transitioning to this as one of my main tools for keeping my life moving forward. No doubt I'll be bugging the community for tips soon, bit for now I am happy.",
"The main app works great but the widget has gotten worse and worse. It now has to refresh 2, 3, and sometimes 4 times when marking a task done. And because of the delay between refreshes, it often leads to accidentally marking the wrong task as done with no way go undo it.",
"Awesome, I didn't find any single downside, everything I need can be done in an elegant and effective way. And since I have installed it, I encounter more and more excellent references for Todoist in different lists, articles and courses regarding productivity and tasks management.",
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us,
"Really great app, helped me with keeping track of school work, do wish there was an events feature to keep track of up coming events amd such, there are probably other areas of improvement as well, but for a personal planner it's pretty good, would recommend to anyone else who needs a digital planner/task manager of some sort",
A place to put those end of day things that would keep you awake; to remember or reschedule; to get organised; to feel productive but less stressed: you get the picture. You know you want a to do list organiser. This one is dynamic and helpful and a pleasing UI... and i don't normally do reviews.,
"Easy way to sync google calendar with Thunderbird calendar. I was looking for a way to carry Thunderbird task list with me. Todoist allows me to sync tasks between devices. The only thing is that the Todoist tasks end up syncing with Thunderbird ""all day"" appointments, rather than showing up on the task list. The good thing is, when you log into Todoist on phone and mark tast as completed, it comes off the Thunderbird calendar.",
"It was great at first. But after the recent update, there's problem with adding new task when using it as widget. When new task is added, it will not shown unless if it was remove and added back as widget on the screen. I couldn't find any apps as best as this. Can you please fix this :(",
"I wanted to like it, but when you download it starts populating BS ""tasks"" for you. Presumably this is meant to be a tutorial, but there is no obvious way turn it off. You have to delete the routines and tasks. I downloaded this to make lists, not to spend time deleting autogenerated garbage from my notifications.",
"Been using this app for a couple of years and overall it's been solid. It's not only a life-saver but it also provides a clean minimalistic aesthetic and intuitive options throughout the ENTIRE app. High quality developments. Seems only natural to have bugs here and there, or else they'd never be able to improve the app's functionality and innovate as a result. Attentive helpful customer support team, devs, AND they provide guides,templates and very helpful tips on their site. Keep it going :)",
"Great app, intuitive interface. You can really make it work according to your needs. I love the easy recurrence setting. A small glitch that I've been getting recently is that if I've completed one or two tasks in a day, I get a popup congratulating me on completing 3. Above 3 it counts correctly. This is with productivity turned off (goals set to 0).",
"Fantastic replacement for Wunderlist! With Microsoft finally shutting down Wunderlist, I needed to find an alternative. I tried about 5 of the most recommended Todo apps and found Todoist to be the only one that truly gave me everything that I wanted. Ive been relying on this app daily for a couple weeks now and it has not let me down yet.",
"I don't like that completed tasks disappear. There's a way to show completed tasks in your inbox setting (not your daily setting) but if you want to personalize how your tasks are sorted you cannot also see your completed tasks. So for instance I'd like to see my incomplete tasks in order from soonest due date to latest, and I also want the satisfaction of seeing what tasks I've completed today. It won't let you do both at the same time though.",
"Todoist has always been one of the most useful apps for me. I have migrated to offline world recently and have decided to plan my works in my journal (instead of Todoist and GCal). However, still I needed a listing app. After a bunch of search between the apps, Todoist is still the best app I can use for making lists üòá (by the way, I should ignore some of its features like daily goals and replace the term of ""project"" with ""list"" in my mind! But it is a perfect choice for me üòä)",
"This app saved my academic career. Without it, I was neglecting my time-tracking and coursework. With it, I cleared the metaphorical bar instead of tripping over it. Its features are well-explained and easy to use or ignore at your leisure.",
"Great app, very helpful for to do lists and projects. Note to the team, I do find confirming a time for a task difficult. I can choose the time easily, but then there is no ""ok"" button or something like that.",
"nice app but the notes function at least should be free in order for this to really work for people. and it'd be a good idea to actually see the project's color when we're inside the project. other than that really good app, even made me plan stuff and i've never been much of a planner. i hate planning but it made me enjoy it, great for jotting down new ideas and stuff you wanna do whether big or small",
"Overall very good. Just a but frustrating that features such as reminders and notes are premium features. Also, moving sub-tasks about can be a bit fiddly but I understand they are working on revamping that system. Has been perfectly serviceable it spite of these things though.",
"Enjoy the app a lot, use the mobile and web version, as well as browser extension. One thing Id like to request from developers is Linux account integration. I'm pretty sure this function existed in the past and allowed to integrate Todoist with, for example, built-in Ubuntu to-do app. On the other hand, native Linux application would suffice, too. All things considered, the app offers many features one could want and subscription offers even more fine ways to tinker and tune one's experience",
"Good app. However, no means to minimize lengthy notes in the inbox. You have to scroll through the entire notes to move from one task to the next. Let there be ways to minimize / expand lengthy notes.",
"Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again ! Updates have now cleared the problem, and we're back to normal.",
"Just think of this app as your brain üß† ü§£Anything you think of put it in the inbox. This is your RAM( Random access memory ) power. No storage required, give ur brain the much needed space üôåüèΩ. Take a look at YouTube video tutorials. There are a lot of people using this app with really good setups. Definitely set this using ur computer. I believe this is the only way to link ur calendar. Gmail has the best integration.",
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!",
"I think I like this app, and have only just begun to use it since download 4 days ago. Yet I've recieved what feels like 40 emails from them. I just need a to-do list on my phone, not a community of todoist's to be part of- that's just too much to do! I got this app to help organize my life, not clutter it with emails. Edit: I was too quick to judge this app. There is a reason for is excellent reviews. It goes deep and the programming is excellent. This free software could benefit a business!",
"I used to use Evernote and had no intention of ever changing. Evernote updated their app and it was a mess. This led me to try Todoist. I didn't know what I was missing. Todoist is unbelievably easy, fast and effective in helping me manage my life and my business. Thank you, Todoist!",
"I can't believe some team can write such a beautiful app..you think and this app have that feature for you...of course you need to explore this app a bit... fantastic...I would have rated 6 stars is what my feeling is..I am a fan of this app...try plug in for outlook, sync is very fast..comment is very powerful...tags, filters, projects, smart schedule....wow!!!!",
"Good app. a lot of useful features. As a premium customer, I would like to have the ability to export to an excel or spreadsheet program for reporting purposes. Also, the app freezes a lot on Windows",
"My bad. You have to be on a Wi-Fi network that your watch recognizes in order to refresh the projects. Still, I would like for Bluetooth to suffice. Otherwise great concept. Good way to organize tasks. I have yet to unleash the full potential of this, without paying, for now.",
"My favorite to-do app out of the insane plethora of to-do apps. I tried a lot but this one stuck with me the most. The key for me was how simple it is but powerful at the same time. A quick ""Water plants every other Saturday p3 #House"" correctly identifies the list it belongs to, sets up the frequency and marks its priority. This app seriously puts me in control of my day so nothing ""slips"" my mind any more. I have recommended it to my boss and he also loves it.",
"very disappointed after i got premium, i was hoping to be able to set goals on a weekly schedule planner but none of that. instead, it keeps tracks on how many tasks i completed overall. but who cares about that? it isn't gonna help me at all. the fact that there isn't any trial to see if we like it or not and we have to pay just to regret it is disappointing.",
"Useful, though there is a learning curve. Getting tasks to nest properly under a single larger task can be fiddly. A lot of features are only available for pay, which is fair. The free version serves its purpose (i.e. keeping track of large numbers of small tasks across multiple devices).",
"Came highly recommended. Tried it. HATE that I can't see the subtasks in a project(why even..), and apparently that's a recent update! Well no one seems to like this feature, or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not, so hope you guys bring it back. Will use it then. Another observation- most of the top-notch features are unavailable to non-Premium users, and not many are willing to subscribe. Seems a bit unfair. One time payment would be great. Will that change?",
"Best Project/Productivity App: The premium version of the app has been well worth the $. I have ADHD and struggle with being overwhelmed by the amount of things that need to be done. This app is becoming my ""second brain"" where I can throw everything in, organize it in a way that makes sense to me, and if I only want to look at what I need to accomplish that day I just look at ""Today"". The ability to create sub tasks for my sub tasks is what I've been looking for in other apps but couldn't find",
"After almost two months, I'm hooked. I can't believe I haven't found this app till now, really helping me get over my hare-brained organization skills. One tip is to start small. 6 tasks per day should be easy, with each task not taking more than an hour. I've now built up to 10 tasks per day and usually accomplish 8. Here's to progress!",
"Amazing app, been using it to manage most of my routines. The auto date recognition is superb, though for some reason they don't give you the ability to view a particular day's completed task, it's not much but I kinda missed that satisfactory feeling that I get when I tick off tasks in Any.do.",
"Since the latest update, the widget I use to check Today's tasks does not update the tasks from one day to another. It's a quite annoying bug, and I can manually force the update by switching to ""Upcoming"" then back to today. Please fix it and I'll gove it 5 stars, this is quite a good app if it wasn't for this issue, which affects how I mainly use it.",
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.,
"I've been using this app and the GTD method to stay focused and organized. My life is pretty crazy. I have 4 young kids, a husband, a house, parents who live with us; I'm a full-time student and a part-time massage therapist. I've also started grant writing on the side. I love being able organize my tasks lists and calendar in one app! I could not have completed a 19-credit course load plus the rest of my life responsibilities without Todoist!",
"After almost a month of daily use, I love it so far! Especially in widget form where I can add tasks, reschedule, edit, etc right there on the homescreen without having to go to the app itself all the time. The added themes/customizability is an added plus as well.",
I'm paying for this and just discovered 41 tracking events in the past 5 minutes. No thanks; I'll pay someone else.,
"Perfect app to help you organize your day and goals. I'll take some time to look at the premium features because there's a whole lot! Sad that all the in-app links with useful info always redirect you to the main page, forcing you to search for them manually.",
"Amazing app. I'm using Pro plan, since I have many projects with different tasks. The app became very handy when developers added board view. The only thing for me missing is a notepad. I would love to have a notepad in the app, so I can make some notes withing my project in overall. Let's say, a wider version of comments feature. Thank you!",
"Initially I was really impressed, and I like the app, but there seems to be one big problem... The search feature. It does not search comments at all. I use comments to keep detailed information of the task, without being able to search and find information in the comments it severely limits the functionality of the app. I was hoping filter would work, but it does not either. That pretty much eliminates the functionality for me.",
Simple and comfortable design. I think a calendar section can be handy (I use 'Upcoming' but it's not so intuitive) and also when scheduling: It's prefer to choose day+hour at the same session- in Todoist it's seperate. But overall it's great.,
"I like it. Wish I could change and reorder events on the widget. Also while typing out bullet reminders for my next projecr, a burst of inspiration came over me and I typed for a while in the subcategories to later organize in word or docs. When scrolling down, I realized multiple paragraphs disappeared with no way to get them back. Wish it auto saved AND added a link or page for typing like converting to word or Google docs if the note reminder winds up being an essay report.",
"Great for setting my to-do list and managing a team. Definitely makes it easier for me to keep pace with all the things I have to do and ensure that everyone on my team is clear on their responsibilities. Would be great to be able to name a manager for each project so that the owner executes, but the manager can know what to follow up on. Also, a reassign feature would be helpful for when a task owner plans to be out of office for any reason.",
"Remains very useful. Only minor irritation is icons for premium features are visible, so occasionally click on them to be told they are not available, leading me to shout at the machine. Also if a task shows as overdue because I forgot to mark it done, I would like to be able to mark it completed yesterday",
"One of the best apps I use. Less buggy than Facebook. They think of useful features, like having a button that takes me into the app after adding a task in the home screen widget. Shows that features are well-thought out. It's the little things üôÇ",
"I've been using this app paid version for years. I use it to manage projects, employees, work task, personal tasks, grocery lists, etc. It's amazing. You owe it to yourself to at least try the free version. My only suggestion would be to add some sort of easy integration to add emails or copy/pastes to a to do item.",
"Constantly buggy. I've used this app for five years, and they are always pushing bad releases. Right now there is a crash expanding lists, which would have been found with some quick testing. Several years ago I filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists. Every few months I check in and out still isn't fixed. The web app is not letting you expand sections. The windows app was scrambling the order for months. They must do zero quality control.",
"Excellent app, takes a little bit to understand all you can do with it but once you do, even without premium it is fantastic. I use the widget to organize everything i want to do and having it has been a huge help in increasing my focus and productivity.",
"Recent major update has strongly impeded on usability of app. I understand and appreciate the focus on subtasks and some other features, however I think the developers have severely misjudged the actual most common user stories. Was always a big fan, paid subscriber for many years, but this update was a major letdown. Unnecessary changes for something that was working almost perfectly.",
"Not all tasks reach completion, some need to be deleted and rightly so. But by design delete action is tucked away under three dots menu and then behind confirmation message. Thus making deleting tasks in bulk deliberately harder, probably to keep fake karma number high and jack up usage statistics.The swipe action on the list should be customisable so delete action can be set when its swipe left. Also since recent updates the upgrade to premium nudge is slapped everywhere.",
"A perfect, simplistic GTD tool that works across all platforms including wear watches. Has just enough features on the free version, that is very much appreciated. I'd be happy to upgrade to the paid version if I need the advanced features.",
"The app is good and user interface is simple. The thing is in free version, the projects are limited to 5 and you cant add descriptions to tasks! Tick tick give 9 projects and can add description even to sub-tasks! Would be nice if we have a merged version between them :"")",
"Need an option to default show the completed tasks. And a Kanban like board view.. like trello with thumbnail support. Overall it's a very good app.. and I have got 1 year Premium.. The best part for me is the notification and reminder syncing across all my devices. All mobiles, laptops and desktops.",
"With my ADHD, this app is a godsend. I use it for a multitude of tasks and it almost certainly makes me better at following through. Lists are handy but Todoist takes it to the next level. Five stars are definitely earned. For me, it's worth the few dollars/month to go premium, but even without all the additional features this app is a must-have for anyone who is in need of that extra mental shelf-space.",
"Great personal and project mangement app. Allows me to see the big picture and smaller supporting steps in an intuitive way, helping me to easily break down overwhelming intersecting projects and plug them in my schedule. Simple and straightforward, easy to use, no glitches.",
"Works as described. Few things I think would improve... Screen widget: Don't delete without confirmation. Plus sign to expand task to show comments. More customization of appearance (individual colors for background, text, etc. not just the included fixed selections)(background transparency).",
Android syncing does not work,
"I use this app everyday and upgraded to a subscription plan. The UI is pleasent enough especially with dark mode. I appreciate how modular the app is: you assign tasks for the day, have them repeat on specific days, assign tasks to projects, and add subtasks. This app has enhanced my productivity. My only complaint is that repeating subtasks don't visually disappear after having been completed that day. I do hope the developers make repeating subtasks behave identically to their parent tasks.",
"Awesome! Was using Wunderlist, but they are going away. I tried a few others. They are all so similar now. But this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads. Also, it is as simple as Wunderlist. I did have to pay $29 and Waunderlist was free for the most important functions, so that was different. But after using the app for a week I'm sold. Not a better app out there for my purposes. KISS- keep it simple stupid. And this app does that.",
"Of all the apps I had like google calendar, tasks and other stuff, this has stood out of all. It's easy, fast and simple. Also, the UI is what appeals me the most and the widget is quite a good feature since I can quickly look at my whole week just by swiping the list from widget. Overall the best in its category.",
"This app optimized my college workflow. Having separate categorized lists for each subject is great. Previously I was using an app that only let you make a check list, this lets you have separate checklists for each category. So for example in my stats class I have separate dated check lists with homework, readings, and reminders. Great stuff!",
"On the widget, you should have make it able to open the app when we click the task (make us easier to do the editing). And also when input new task, I prefer it was put on top instead of below so we can keep track to avoid double input. But so far still ok. Thanks.",
"This is without a doubt one of the best apps I have. It took me a year (2016/17) switching one productivity app to another.. google keep, evernote and google calendar all to keep my tasks and reminders the way I need em. This blessed app gave me all these in one, and a lot more. It helped me get weekly status reasults, boosts and karma, labels, prioritizing feature, Filters, the awesome widget on home screen... i just love it. Funny there're still features i havent digged yet",
"I've been using todoist for almost 6 months every day, it's perfect for my ADHD addled brain. With Todoist I can manage day to day little things without being bogged down by an over-complicated UI. My work has improved, my habits have improved, and my girlfriend no longer gets annoyed because I forget to do the dishes 30 times.",
This has saved me from myself! I feel like I am always so disorganized I can never find my tasks or set a schedule. Being able to write it all in one placeü•≥ is phenomenal and having it auto organize based on various things has been a life saver. my ADHD brain will never be able to live without this app!,
"Amazing organization. It helps me a lot organising my day. I used google Calendar earlier but didn't find it very friendly (no offence). However, this app really helped me a ton. One star less because i have a feedback to share, which i feel.is a downside. Some tasks might span over days, say from Monday to wednesday but this app only takes specific days. It would be nice to have an option to let it spread over days.",
"Todoist is extremely helpful with my productivity; its layout is intuitive and it's organized very well. It has a minimalistic design while still having many features that other apps do not have, given that I've tried many agenda setting/to do list apps, and this has worked the best for me.",
"Nice app. Does the job it claims to do really well through a simple, intuitive, and easy to learn UI. Also, does not overwhelm with ads. They are placed well and do not continually interfere with app usage.",
"Best to do list app I've used. Super seamless and easy to learn without forcing you to learn their paradigm. Lots of features available to organize, but you don't have to use them if you don't want to. Highly recommend, especially as a UX Designer and Researcher. Very flexible and so quick to get started.",
"I tried the free version. I liked the way, that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself, but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus. I prefer to use Google task app, that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task.",
"I have a tendency to be a scattered, distracted worker. This has helped me focus, plan, and write down things when they occur to me (instead of spending energy trying to remember). This also utilizes my phone being on me all the time as a strength in productivity instead of a hindrance.",
"The app has helped me alot be more productive, the interface is good and everything works nicely. To todoist team I would love a functionality to track my habits, i.e. the tasks I repeat on daily basis, currently I use another app for that(habits loop). Cause adding a repetitive tasks daily becomes tedious. So if that can be added to it'd be just awesome. Anyways keep up the good work. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",
"Incredibly intuitive to how I think and is even better than how I would've designed such a product. Looking forward to enjoying additional features this company incorporates into the app as I can already see from existing features that they make smart business and technological decisions. Would love a calendar view, but I understand that it's not really a calendar app. Would love to be able to make entire ""sections"" recurring and remove character limitations. Keep up the good work! üëçüèª",
"Free version does everything I want - handy reminder list, easy to move tasks around, smart recurring tasks, clear way to organize home, work and other tasks, smooth transition between mobile and desktop versions. Switched from my old task organizer to Todoist a few months ago and have never regretted the switch!",
"Love Todoist! I love that I can remove all the clutter of my projects from my head and put them in the app organized. Besides normal ""to-do"" like paying Bill's, or dog to the vet, it helps me organize hobby projects, automobile maintenance, shopping lists, projects at work, and even listing fun things to do around town (like a bucket list). I haven't used some of the advanced features yet.",
I've been using Todoist for many years now dor both professional and private tasks. I paid early on for the full version and it's worth buying it eg. to set reminders and for many other important features. I have no idea what else could I use as effectively as this app for this crazy problem of managing my tasks all around... Good job guys! Thx!,
"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",
"Used Todoist years ago, then went on to MS TO-DO. Couldn't get To Do to sync with Calendar. went back to Todoist and realised how awesome it is. Simple, professional, smooth, efficient. It syncs with everything and the Ul is just perfect! Seriously, I've tried them all, Asana, Trello, ToDo, etc. Todoist is the 'sticker'",
"Very good at helping me stay organized. I would like the ability to make expiration dates for tasks so if i don't do them by a certain point they disappear, but that's really the only ""missing"" feature that i'd want and use.",
"Life changing. Worth the subscription price. I have tried many task apps. Love the sub tasks, labels vs projects, sharing, app integrations, color coding, repeating task options, due dates and clean anesthetics. The ability to enter due dates in abbreviated natural language is so time saving. Encouragements for completing tasks also cute and fun.",
"Todoist is great, no questions about it. Well built, nicely designed, regularly updated. I've been a premium user since Wunderlist was on the chopping block. However, I realized I'm paying $36 each year for essentially one feature: task reminders. Additionally, 2 users in 1 household on 1 budget pay 100% more for both to use the app. I think that's ridiculous so I'm out.",
"I love this app, but would it be possible to Sort the tasks in the widget according to the already set preferences? It's quite irritating to add a task from the widget which has higher priority than those on the list, only to see it added at the bottom of the list (off screen), thus obliging me to then open app, choose Sort, and manually reorder tasks (with same preference, Priority) so that the new task will go straight to the top of the list on the widget. The widget should automatically sort newly added items according to established preferences. Thanks!",
"Great app, but needs to be able to switch accounts easily. I have an account for personal life, and work life. On my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist.",
Easily the best app I have EVER installed. I pay for Premium and I probably will for the rest of my life but it is beyond worth it. I recommend this app to everyone I meet that I think could benefit from knowing about it. I love the new features that have been added such as sub-tasks and the organization tools and predictive tagging make this app 10x better than even it's closest competitor. No other to do list app can even hold a candle to this one.,
"I needed a To do app, after trying 5 or 6 this is by far the best. I have it installed on 5 phones within my family now as well as pc's and Mac's to make sure tasks that were forever being forgotten are no longer left behind. The only drawback I have found so far is that you cannot set a reoccurring event. There are many tasks that I do for work or home that happen weekly, monthly or annually. I can go through and add events in the future but this would be a huge task. Am I missing something?",
"I'd like it except the widget is the most important feature for me. It displayed my inbox for about a week and now comes up blank. The tasks are there tho. I can read them if I open them, or open the app. :-( You're not the only organizer with this problem tho. Android 9.",
"It lets you takes notes provided you've payed for premium. In any case, it's one of the best apps I've tried: it lets you stay productive, doesn't have other things that would affect your overall focus by spending too much time doing things within the app, and creating tasks couldn't be easier.",
"Todoist is absolutely amazing and completely love it after switching off Wunderlist once Microsoft started breaking it and completely love it, which is amazong since I liked Wunderlist so much (I stopped once Microsoft started breaking it). The only complaint I have is that the annual cost for getting all of the features is a little high so my liking, hence the 4 stars. Make it a little lower or male it REALLY worth the $$ and it'll easily jump to 5.",
"Edit to my original review: this issue has been fixed very quickly by the devs! Working beautifully again and extremely happy with the speed of their work. Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days. Edit: I have emailed details of the bug to support.",
"Update: notifications have returned. I would go back to 5 stars but my four day interaction with customer service was disappointing, including telling me there would be no prorated refund for loss of service. >>I've been communicating with cust service and every time they say ""try this we think it's fixed"" it isn't. SUPER disappointing, unfortunately will be canceling my annual premium subscription if not fixed today.",
"Easy way to organize myself and my family. I'm looking forward to continued use. I'm currently using the free version, so I can't rate the full version. There is enough usability with the free version for personal use. I assume the enhanced features would be beneficial for project planning with a team.",
"I particularly like how it transforms normal sentences into scheduled items, such as, ""Clean the washer filter every two months starting this Friday"". I upgraded to Premium after using this for a couple of years, because a few of the remaining features (like Notes) seemed useful, and the app developers had earned to right to some of my money, as I saw it.",
"I've used the app for a few weeks now and I'm very impressed! Usually calendar organization and planning is a drag for me, but this app has made it so much easier, even on the free version. I just wish I could see a full calendar of the month with tasks/colors.",
"at first just a couple things needed to get used too but this app has seriously saved me mentally- I get very overwhelmed even when theres not much to do so being able to write it all down and tick things off is very helpful and is helping me destress!!! i seriously recommend this to anyone who has similar anxiety/depressive feelings of being overwhelmed no matter the task, and/or executive dysfunction... its really helped me.",
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.",
"Life changing! Very much needed for 2021! If I could give this app more than the limited 5 stars, I would. Beautiful interface. It didn't take me too long to get a hang of it as well. So much more more organised than the other planner apps I have come across :)",
"TODoist is a FANTASTIC app! It is one of the better apps that I have worked with in business, yet to be honest I first stumbled upon it by looking for a timer app that would interact / syncronize with Trello. It was then that I read that ToDoist DOES sync with many other apps, and that if I were using Pomodone (a pomodoro timer app), then all that I do in ToDoist would be readily synced into Pomodone, allowing me to not only schedule and prioritize my time but ALSO to discipline myself to accomplish it through timers. If you are using ToDoist than Pomodone seems like it was built purely to enable your productivity goals in ToDoist! Together, these apps are unbeatable! Having said all of this, ToDoist is alone ABSOLUTELY worth the time and money to learn and to purchase! I have used MANY different scheduling or GTD systems, and ToDoist is far and away the best that I have used! Do yourself a great favor and learn the keyboard shortcuts!! These are very powerful in action. The app‚Äôs ability to understand common language / phrasing is simply uncanny! REALLY WELL DONE!!! I highly recommend ToDoist. I mysefl committed to changing the system that I was already using, (largely because of the tie-in between ToDoist and Trello and Pomodone), and I can certify that it was WELL worth my investment of time!",
I like this app because it erases things that you checked off when you click the circle. There are other to do lists that do not do this and you have to go to multiple screens to delete what you did. Very easy to use and a very happy,
"As I've gotten older, those ""Oh, I must remember to xyz"" thoughts get forgotten more readily. Short term memory isn't what it was. With Todoist, I can schedule, verbally, by Alexa, or by simply typing, any reminder. Such as ""take garbage out every Thursday at 7am"", ""change bank passwords every 2 months"". Todoist software is a great add-on to my life because it supplements my normal productivity engine. My productivity has always been a sense of pride. Todoist let's it continue to be so.",
"I was using Todoist for more than 3 years now. Mostly free version, since its enough for me to track my tasks. Todoist is very intuitive and easy to use productivity tool. it helped me a lot, backing up my memory and reminding me of important actions. 5 out of 5. Thank you for a great app and service!",
"This is a great app. It can be as simple or complicated as you want. Upgrading gives you access to labels which can help with context and filtering. Depending on how you organize, this can be a big help, but the app works great even without upgrading.",
Its a very good tool for keeping on track but I have adhd and its difficult for me to use sometimes since It doesn't include reminders or alarms unless you pay which I can't do. Overall its a very good app and can be used on desktop too but I would like if it was free to get reminders,
"Coming from Wunderlist, this is the best one I found. There is one thing which I find irritating. The added item goes to the bottom of the list. Can you add an option to sort by reverse date? That would make it perfect list for me.",
"It's a great app with a bug that occasionally unmoves the task you just tried to reorganize the order of. It's frustrating to have a full day of tasks, try to put them in the order they belong in, and have each one undo itself and need placing twice.",
"Largely a good app. The beat To Do app I've found. -1 Star because the app has started to put out a ""Turn on location reminders"" notification, and there is no way to disable that (I can't even find the setting, even if I did intend to turn it on, which I don't).",
"Can no longer set reminders without upgrading to pro version. Defeats the purpose of the app. This was a great app, very easy to use and the widget was so much better than other similar apps. But they just had to ruin it. I'm uninstalling.",
I love thus App! We use it as a team at work and it helps us get things done! We dont forget projects plus we can see who has completed what and it does 85% of everthing I want it to do and it does it well. The two things I hope they add is the ability to wtite notes and have monthy views with out the need of your calander. If they do that it would do everthing that I want 100% of the ways I wouf like to use it. That would bring my rating up to 5 stars,
Todoist is by far the greatest app I have ever used. It runs my entire life and I can't imagine parting from it ever. I have probably used every major productivity app across every platform and I always come back to this one. The flexibility and feature set it provides is completely unmatched by anything else.,
"To doist is wonderful app but it lacks one major thing, that... we can not insert a new bullet or line in btwn lines. Dynalist has this feature. If todoist implements this feature it will be lot beneficial for end users. for now new task always goes bottom of the last task n then we have to move it and reallign or readjust the sequence.",
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.",
"Todoist has truly changed my life! I am far more purposeful and productive from using it and the sense of achievement and fulfillment from this is great. I use the projects function to organise all of my work tasks (I'm a primary teacher) but I also make sure to schedule time to spend on hobbies, skills, interests and personal goals, and I'm making far more progress on all of that than I ever was previously. I'm pretty much hooked for life now, Todoist! üòÅ",
"I was really surprised at how effective this app is. As a incurable procrastinator I had little hopes this app would have any positive impact on my persistent lack of motivation to do anything. But it worked! I load the app with things I need to do at the start of the day and by the end I have done them all. I often add items to my list throughout the day and manage to get them done too. This may not sound like much , but to me it's been a miracle.",
"I've gone through many To Do lists apps and this has been my favorite for over a year. If you haven't given this a try then you are doing yourself a disservice. Clean, night mode, not glitchy, and the free version is 5/5.",
"Might be slow in adding more features compared to other apps, but I think, it's because of their focus on the app's reliability - which is very much evident. Long time user, tried other apps, but I keep coming back to todoist with how useful and functional it is. It's worth trying and keeping.",
"I really enjoy todoist. I have to compartmentalize my task lists and being able to create separate projects, sections, and add labels helps keep me organized. Having the functionality to add reminders, comments, share, and put priorities on tasks further makes this a useful app.",
"I reviewed the software to provide 80 projects in free version and collaborators. On installing the product today, it has reduced the projects and collaborators all of a sudden. I was so confused looking at the pricing page show different things all of a sudden to understand there has been an update. Though the app is good, but it's targeted towards premium users more than the basic users. Wouldn't serve the purpose. I guess I would have to program my own to get pretty basic features in an app!",
"The problem with most todo apps is they overcomplicate it, making it hard to use. This app excels at being simple to just add a task but also contains the power to be truly customizable. The app has saved me multiple times. Worth the subscription.",
"It's a great app. Thank you. I wish it would let me to write time and cost of each task I list, so I could calculate how much I need to invest, also it would be nice if I could organize my tasks based on priority and change their priorities if necessary.",
"App is great, one thing I would love is a calendar view of a whole month with tasks. It could be really helpful at planning. And maybe some sort of a habit tracker where you can see when you completed your habits and when you failed to do so :]",
"So far, really great app. Keeps everything organized and not overwhelming. I love how it is available on multiple platforms as well. Great productivity tool. I wish I didn't have to pay a subscription for extra features. I'd like a one-time purchase for the full version.",
"So i dont understand, I just installed this app *on my phone*, so why do I need to ""continue"" with an email account, Google, or Facebook? Can't I just open the app and check things out to see how it works without ""signing up"" for something? Update: Okay, everything is stored in the cloud. Well I guess this App isn't for me then, since I want my data stored on my local device. But that is really too bad as it sounded like an interesting app. (I don't want to use a fake email address).",
"I've been a dedicated ""To do list"" user for decades and Todoist is literally the online app of my dreams. I've tried several and all had shortcomings. From desired features to seamless integration across multiple platforms, Todoiest has it all and does it all. I'm loving it! If you use To Do lists daily I highly recommend Todoist.",
"After starting to use todoist I've seen subtle, yet real improvement to my life. Some productivity boost, but the biggest betterment is in my mental state. With a solid service like this I feel secure and confident knowing that I can outsource remembering my responsibilities and deadlines, and know that I will get to all tasks I enter because it just works that well. Todoist also has an open API, so I set up a script to email me the most important tasks of the day every morning üëå. Bonus points",
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium",
"This app can potentially change your life, and that's not hyperbole! It's intuitive to use and seemlessly updates your data across devices. I'm deducting a ‚≠ê because it has a paid subscription rather than a one-time payment.",
"I use this app everyday for work and home. It really helps keep me organized and keeps me working to priorities. Todoist continues to make usability improvements that add icing to the cake. I have a paid subscription...as a bit of a miser, that pretty much tells what I think of it. Thumbs up.",
"Great tool for implementing the ""Getting Things Done"" methodology. The sub-subtasks under subtasks, options to label, and add due date to each task (including subtasks) are excellent features that are present in TODOIST. It's integration with Google Calendar is again amazing that help you to remember and review all your tasks at same place. I recommend this app to users who intend to efficiently multitask.",
"This looked promising, but I literally had no welcome or intro to using this app whatsoever, and it came across to me as too fiddly and time consuming to work it all out. Honestly, sometimes it's best to keep things simple - writing lists and goals shouldn't be made this complicated. I've uninstalled and found a more basic app, this 1 isn't for me.",
"It's good, but everytime I mark a task as completed on the widget I have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again. You guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime. Cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way I dislike constantly.",
"Great app but need a calendar & a timer to make it complete. Im a visual person and I love time blocking so long lists overwhelm me, for todoist to shine at the top you guys need to implement a calendar and then a timer at some point. Visually and speed of entry are outstanding but need just those to make it complete.",
"I once rated this app and company a five star. However long, with their recent updates they have utterly failed to test the user experience. All the alerts.settings are changed so you get texts, notifications and emails when you had turn them off. The suggested time zone change so their app ""will.function correctly"" breaks the assigned due date times. I like to see companies trying to improve, but if they are this lazy with the user experience who lazy are they with customer data. Lost of all trust here.",
"The widget, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app, doesn't seem to be updating anymore, even when I click the refresh button. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed.",
"it's a great getting things done app, can be simple to use, can be very functional. Cross platoform and just nice to use. 4 starts are because the premium which unlocks features that calendar has, costs ¬£36 a year, which i think is too much for what it's offerring.",
I got tired of keeping paper lists of things I had to accomplish & having to write the uncompleted ones over & over. Then the irritation of carrying the list & keeping track of where I put it. Now I carry the list on my Todoist & enjoy marking them off but reminding me what I need to work on. Great tool!,
"Giving Todoist a 2-star review because the sync issues are so frequent that it makes the app a pain to use. Real shame because the interface is really sleek and there are some great features. Sync issues I've encountered: - I try to add a task and it doesn't actually add because it didn't sync for some reason - I try to add a task using the laptop app and it doesn't add because sync issue - I try to move a task up in the list and it doesn't work, goes back to initial position",
"Organized, takes a slight bit of getting used to, but highly recommended. Have gotten several people into using it & is effective to the degree that I may push for my company to embrace its use as well. DEVS: Can we get a slightly different visual indicator for the ""Today"" & ""Inbox"" screens? I often edit my own tasks & those I have collab'd on, & often catch myself forgetting what screen I'm in. Colored bar down one side, slightly tinted background to match project color, etc. KEEP IT UP! :)",
"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.",
"Essential to my sanity. I can sync to-dos with my calendars and send tasks from my email (with attachments) to my to-do list. This app is the one thing keeping me sane and somewhat looking like I'm on top of things. Well, mostly sane anyway.",
So far has been a great replacement form Apples Reminders. I always used Reminders app to sync all my tasks between phone table and computers and switching to Android I was worried. But this has worked perfect. Even better. It syncs with everything and has a nice and clean organized interface. I'm digging it.,
"The only way this would be better is if there were a built-in calendar and notifications for items with a time deadline. But overall I love the app, especially the seamless syncing between desktop and mobile apps.",
"If you want to track tasks via a todo list interface, this is the app for you. Having an inbox to dump stuff into is a god send, allowing me to focus on what needs doing today by getting everything else out of my head for processing at a later time. Highly recommended.",
"This has to be the best free app there is. It is thoroughly AMAZING and it does everything I need it to do. I love recording the things I need to do--getting them out of my head and into the app gives me so much peace of mind. I use it to organize and schedule all kinds of tasks, both personal and professional. Highly recommended!",
"I had been happily using Todoist for over a year until it started sending me junk notifications (an attempt to get you to open the app) on days I didn't have any tasks scheduled, it wasn't possible to disable these without disabling the notifications for my actual tasks as they had them under the same notification category. This rendered the app useless to me so I've uninstalled it, nice work team.",
"Easily one of the most useful tools I've discovered in my lifetime. For me, the cross platform functionality and simple UI just works. I also love the brand and the company, and how they support remote work and promote design philosophy.",
I made the switch from post-it notes to this app to be more environmentally responsible maybe 2 years ago and haven't looked back. Great free app that has all the basics and then some necessary for keeping things in check. Highly recommend.,
"Very intuitive and easy to use. The scheduling and recurrence features are great for setting up daily drumming practice sessions, as well as getting other life stuff done. Karma points are an added bonus that help keep me motivated.",
Your reminder system could use some improvements please. If we could just click the clock and a watch would pop up where we just input the time or you suggest intervals of 30 min or 1 hour. At the moment we have to type out the time and it's not efficient. I use the app for my sales team 8 hours a day. Please do something about this.,
Editing (changing) the timing and frequency of recurring events is infuriating enough for me to give it only one star. This should be one of the most fundamental and easiest things to do in an app that bills itself as a top notch time management/ PM tool.,
Lovely App. A perfect app. I had gone through a lot of apps but this one is just awesome. I am using it and it's very useful. Very simple and I like the way it reminds of pending uncompleted tasks via phone and e mails. It's a very important tool for me on daily basis. Bravo to the developers of this app.,
"I have lived by Todoist for the last four years. I love tgat it syncs with my Google calendar and how easy it is to set recurring items and reschedule. My only complaint is that i have to go to my Google calendar to look more than 7 days out. I havent tried any other to-do list apps, but ive been quite pleased with this one!",
"This app is easy to use and has good options to schedule and organize tasks. I got it because it was recommended by Tim Challies in his book Do More Better (a Christian book on productivity). Adding, scheduling, and organizing tasks is easy with this app. The trick is to consistently do the tasks that you add to the app!",
"Todoist is the best. I've been trying to change to other apps, buy todoist is easy to use, has many options to manage tasks and projects. It has also nice and clean UI. Creating tasks by natural language is really making it fast to create task.",
"2/11/23 - Recent update doubles down on gamifying the app. I had to delete my goals to keep from getting daily and weekly pop-ups when reaching them. There should be an option to stop these pop ups for the people who don't want a full-screen celebration everytime they do their normal day-to-day functions. Not everyone wants a cheering section all the time. Glad it's here for those who do, but I want to be able to turn it off.",
"Really useful app, i like that i can set repeating reminders. It would be nice to be able to do something like ""lunch prep sunday-thursday"" and have that repeat, rather than ""lunch prep every sunday"" ""lunch prep every monday"", but it's a small thing. I'd also like reminders, but that's a premium thing and they have to make money somehow so oh well. overall i do love this app!",
Love everything about the app except the new swipe animations are awful. I swipe right to complete and the task used to just completely swipe off the screen but now it bounces back and just fades away. It makes me feel like I didn't swipe correctly every time.,
"Great app!!! After I used almost all the apps for tasks and events. The enhancements almost every week/month üëè üëç üëå The support team is excellent, well knowledge and contribution. I have more than a year with the premium version; I won't think to go to another app.",
"Mainly using it because it integrates with spark email app but the chrome extension is great and features like filters, labels, and search are pretty good but can be better. No task descriptions which is weird but task comments make it work. Overall pretty good.",
I have nothing but good things to say about this app. A few months ago I started using the desktop version and it's helped my productivity a ton. I'm a former sticky note addict and todoist has been the cure lol This app is entirely what you make it though. Put in some effort with creating tasks and it'll pay off with time saved later on!,
"App is very easy to use, with a simple guide when you first download it! Only used it for one day so far, but found the organising quite efficient and helped me to streamline my brain quite easily without the mess of pen and paper! Very happy so far!",
buy the premium version! i have tried many apps for my gtd. but this is the one that works. its got an easy UI so you can add and edit tasks without going into different screens. you can priortize itsms which i find very useful as it shows you what is your primary focus,
Great app for managing my ever growing to do list. There is the option to add tags to separate between work and personal projects. There is also a great feature that allows you to rapidly prioritise tasks by typing p1 p2 p3. Would recommend.,
Great little app that does exactly what you want it to and more! Helps in my job to self-manage and organise tasks as well as setting individual goals for myself. Even started using it as reminders for things at home! Very handy and super useful,
"This app is a great to do list app, and it makes a great homework planner. I use this with the board view at school and it is awesome. I have a school Chromebook and the PWA is top-notch, and the Android app is great at sending notifications for homework assignments. Also, the widgets are great and the free plan. 10/10 experience!",
I love this app as a simple way to keep me on track and help me plan out what needs to be done. I only wish that i could configure it to a modified day structure. Since i work 3rd shift i stay up all night and once it goes past 12 it complains that i missed a task. When in fact I'm just barely halfway through the day.,
"Bought a premium as a gift to my friend on 21 Dec, had soon many issues with getting this pro to her account!!! At the end, my money was reimbursed and her pro cancelled. With a second try they gave us a link to pay, but their price was 25% higher than initial price (we were trying to arrange annual subscription). Bitterly disappointed with their service. Was left without pro. Thankfully, got my money back. But they have spoiled mood completely.",
The free app works but is too basic. Upgrading to the full features (with little detail on what these are) costs $30 PER YEAR. Insane pricing for a to do list. Only a complete budgetary idiot would load up on app subscriptions that steep.,
Awesome app. Would give 5 stars if: Capability to add lists outside of Inbox for items that are processed and organized within my contexts (I use labels for these). That way inbox is just for new to-dos fresh out of my head with no processing only. Using projects for this is a work around.,
Thank you so much for this app. This app helps me so much in doing my everyday tasks because I'm so forgetful about what I should do the next day and this app is so easy to add task that I don't feel complicated when I need to add a task quickly. The home widget button is also pretty and easy to use still. Doing daily/weekly/monthly task is so easy. The shortcuts really helped me.,
I cannot live without this app! It's the first and only list making app I have been able to actually use and ditch paper. It is rich in easy to use features and I love that it syncs everywhere. Super well done and never any glitches.,
"Great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw. Every time I create a task, it goes to the bottom of the list. I always want the task at the top so I can see it. That's the whole point of using a to do list. So I have to drag the task, one by one to the top. Makes me crazy.",
"I like using the app, but unfortunately it crashes every time i reschedule large amount of tasks at the same time. (I had 170 tasks yesterday and i did only 70. Today i woke up and rescheduled the 100 from yesterday and it crashes) There's no such issue when i do it through the web version.",
"This app is so clunky to use and the premium fees would be a complete ripoff. So bad I tried another by Pocket Brilliance. Huge improvement, even w the free version and paid is more reasonable. Steer clear of this one, just a ploy to force you to upgrade to premium. Free version doesnt even let u see completed tasks older than a week. Just one example of many where they fall short here or try to force premium sales.",
"I have found this app very helpful for keeping track of deadlines in university and staying on top of responsibilities outside of school. I would suggest adding the option to configure what time the day resets. For example, I like to write out tasks for the next day before I go to bed, which may be after 12 am. Adding this feature would prevent accidentally schdeduling tasks a day later than intended.",
Conatant sync problems. Throwing errors when trying to view activity log. Not all actions of collaborators are logged. For example collaborator completed a task and it doesn't show in notifications. But sometimes it does. All in all very unpredictable app.,
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.,
In the last few weeks I can't see any of the font unless I put in dark mode. If I click on the name of the item it just pops up and disappears right away. I didn't see any updates but not sure what changed it's not very useful anymore. Issue resolved.,
"I'm impressed by the clean interface and straightforward approach - it has exactly the features you need for TODOs without bloat, complication, or distraction. The price point also works for me ($3/mo if purchased annually; no additional charge for my wife to access my projects on her device).",
"After using this product for a month on the computer and my phone, I have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with. The free option isn't as good as other options such as Microsoft To Do and the paid solution offers little more than these either.",
"I didn't get even the access to add lables and reminder which done for free by many others. I look forward for doist to include at least lables and reminders with the free plan. I really loved but without the mentioned features in the free plan, I don't want to make it my to do list app.",
prevuously I would have given this app 1000 stars... I love this app but it just updated and now the widget isn't functional.. I've been using this app for years and never had a problem.. I'm very sad about this.. This app has been so beneficial to me and having the widget made my life easier and was a good reminder that I had stuff to do.. now I have to rewire my brain to actually open the app instead of just seeing it on my home screen... Also the view all isn't working for me.. ‚òπÔ∏èü´§,
"Todoist is the cornerstone of my organizational system. I am an undergraduate student and use this app to manage my reading assignments, exam schedule, administrative deadlines etc. sync with windows 10 desktop app is awesome. I am a free user and would gladly pay a one time price for full features here but a monthly subscription is a turn off.",
Great app. Use it basically every day. Would love if there was a way to 'select all' items on your list when your on your phone. Gets a bit annoying having to select each item one by one when you want to make batch edits.,
"An incredibly robust task list app. I love the natural language dates. It makes entering tasks super easy. I use it in conjunction with the desktop app. One thing I'd like to see imoroved is the subtask handling. Overall, its great",
"New update ""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Who the hell thought this was a good idea?? Why have you removed a feature people use?? You have made your app far more inconvenient, especially your widget. Please restore this feature. I have been an avid supporter of your app for well over 2 years, recommending it to everyone I know. This is a very disappointing decision.",
"After years of using many different checklist apps, Todoist remains my favourite for its compatibility with the GTD method. It has just the right amount of features. I have alternated between Premium and free, and am currently a Premium user as I really wanted the Label feature.",
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used.",
"I've been using Todoist for several years. I an engineer and like efficient tools. I stumbled upon the app myself when trying out many others. Its definitely the simpliest, best layed out and easy to app I've used. I really love it. Intuitive. Also it sincs on web so I can eaisly share accross devices and computers. Highly reccommend.",
The only problem I (and as I know many others too) have with this app is that I can't see periodic tasks in upcoming days and can only see the upcoming one. This makes difficult to handle and distribute tasks considering available time. Other than that its excellent and complete.,
"So many features and sub categories to keep you organized at all times. It is the best app that I've ever used for tracking important dates. I even use it to track all my bills, and it just gives me the peace of mind that I haven't felt in a long time. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
"This app is perfect for my personal task management. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I like how easy it is to quick add tasks, schedule, and how I can integrate with Gcal. Every idea I have to do anything goes in here. I need reminders for everything; I even use Todoist to remind me to change the sheets :)",
"This app has served me well for a long time, I love it, but its free version is missing one crucial feature for forgetful people like me: Reminders. It's hard to part ways Todoist, but I keep forgetting to do things lately. I'm gonna have to find another task app!",
"Great app that helps me get organized! I love the different projects I can create, plus the inbox and option to set a due date. This has helped me get more done and not lose things like I was before with one long list.",
Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.,
"Downloaded the app several months ago. Was a bit confused at first. Tried again a couple of weeks ago, am now incorporating the app in my daily task toolbox. It's pretty awesome so far! Now I just need to clone myself, and it would be nice if a pocket sized task demon would come give me a slap when I get distracted! üëπ üòÖ",
"I hope the ""completed task"" can be still seen on the list. I also hope new feature will be added: a journal, a habit tracker (literal) and a note-taking feature. Overall, it is a neat app.",
"This app is changing my life. I know it sounds dramatic, but for someone who grew up playing video games (specifically RPG, MMOs, or any other form of roleplaying) this is all sorts of up my alley. I would absolutely recommend this app to any one looking for a great to do app. It's worth the money, especially when you know you spend it elsewhere.",
Just starting to use this. One instant improvement .. the two cogs on the profile and productivity overview LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME. They're also in virtually the same place ... So my brain tells me they'll trigger the same thing. The fact they don't is super confusing. Change one of the icons to something different. I'd be willing to bet you'll get better usage metrics.,
"Wow... A To Do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring. I won't lie, I am absolutely baffled that this is omitted. Maybe it's in the web version, or the iOS version, but I'll never know... You tick a date in the calendar and... Where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx'? Maybe it's a premium feature, I guess I'll never know that either...",
"Very useful for me. Appreciate being able to create projects that I can export/import, but wish I could create recurring tasks as well. I use to keep organized between work and home, and switch between the app and desktop.",
"Arguably the best get-things-done app/online service out there. it runs on every screen, is quick and easy to jot down an idea or task, and is easy to review/ edit. Brain dump - organize - assign - calendarise - complete - celebrate I highly recommend.",
"Some features are not available unless you upgrade, but I'm still testing out the service and not sure I'll need those features. The upgrade is not expensive and the service is pretty slick overall.",
"I'm trying to find the right program to use, not only to get organized but to stay focused on what's important to my business. Todist works great and integrates with other applications I'm using like Trello. I upgraded to premium and will continue to explore and grow using Todist.",
"I'm loving this app. The web browser version is equally amazing since you don't have to go find a bunch of buttons to press to make repeating tasks and can just type ""everyday at 2 pm"" and it very intelligently sets up the reminder for you.",
"Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY.",
"Absolutely essential. I use todoist every single day to keep things organized. The app offers lots of flexibility and an intuitive UX. I have an IFTTT automation that makes my calendar events ibto todoist items, which makes it even more useful.",
Best To Do List App I've ever used. Had multiple other To Do List Apps installed to test which work best for me and this app come out on top. Highly recommended to anyone searching for To Do List options. Even without the premium version this app is ahead brilliant. Nothing is unnecessary complicated and the ability to set daily/weekly goals truly pushes me to get more done.,
"Useful but flawed - biggest issue for me is adding subtasks to recurring tasks. If I mark the subtasks done in January, they are still marked as done when the main task comes around again in Feb. Having checked the help centre, this appears to be intended functionality and can be worked around, but it's really not practical to do so when you have a lot of subtasks",
"This app has helped me become much more organized in my work life. As a construction project manager I value the ability to quickly add the many different tasks and to do items I have from any work station or my phone. Easy to use, plenty of ways to use it well.",
"2022-07J-13th - Over a year later, still using & still a solid 5 stars. I also take back my previous remark concerning being able to set a reoccurrence by typing it. It is incredibly handy. 2021-06J-25th - So far, so good. The ability to set a reoccurrence by typing it in is clever, but less useful than I suspect the developers think it is. I'd rather have a field to pick from. At the moment it seems to have all the functionality I'm after. 2021-06J-24th - Installed & evaluating.",
"I have tried every todo app in play store and this is the best. I am managing an entire project and solely depend on todoist for everything. My only suggestion is, please sort the tasks by priority as default, so even if i add a new task let it get added to its priority order, or else a top priority work i recently added will go unnoticed at the bottom of the list.",
Grate app for people that like lists and bulletpoints for daily tasks and long term goals. Not much I can say in terms of cons. Except it's kinda annoying when it automatically converts associated letters to weekdays and schedules task for that day. Aside from that cool app.,
A nice little app. Liked most aspects of it... But had to uninstall because of just one feature - reminder. I dont know why would someone decide to ship this very basic feature as a premium one! If an app like this reminds me after two days in an email that I have overdue tasks than there is absolutely no purpose of using such an app.,
"I use the free version. There's good integration with Google calendar. I make use of recurring tasks, projects and subtasks. Would be nice if the duration was an attribute of the tall that can be modified",
Great task managing tool. But I looked it better before the update. I used to be able to see all the sub-project when I select the mother project. That makes it easier for me to manage my teams. I wish it at least gives us the option to view those or not.,
"I liked a lot this app, the only problem I'm having os that I don't get any reminder or notification, even though I marked accordingly on settings. I wouldn't mind to pay for the app with I was sure that if with the paid version that would change. That's the only reason I'm looking for another app.",
"I think Todoist is the best ToDo app out there. The free version is pretty awesome by itself, it contains no ads whatsoever. I've recently started using the premium version and I find it perfect. Also the Doist team is very friendly, they answer to all questions via Twitter.",
"after being a dedicated user of a different productivity app for many years i made the change and am now kicking myself for not doing it sooner. I'm already achieving a lot more than i ever did. Constant updates, excellent support files, cross platform. No brainer really.",
"Great app, love it. The downside is they charge 4 euro a MONTH for the optional use of the alarm on the reminder, which is crazy expensive. 48 euro a year and you don't even own the app for that. Not wise charging that much during a pandemic so that's why I'm deducting a star.",
"Easy to use, Nice UI, Dark mode, Active development, Free and Paid, Free offers very nice amount of features, Multi platforms, Syncs, Very helpful for people looking to create a routine, need structure, or just simply to keep a grocery list. I use extensively and love it, plus you can invite and give permissions to others you collab with, like Mamabear ‚òπÔ∏è, she can't help her self with just loading it up. ü§¶üèº",
"I live my life by Todoist! The iphone and Apple desktop apps are great, but I would really like to see an improved desktop app for Chromebooks. The interface is designed for Androids, which makes it clunky and inefficient on a Chromebook.",
"The app is kinda glitchy. My list has lots of tasks that are sub-tasks under a main task. When I press the carrot to expand/collapse a main task, it expands the list, but displays everthing twice. I have to press the carrot again for the list to display correctly.",
This app is easy to use and very helpful; especially since I difficulties in remembering. It reminds me of tasks I didn't complete and I can move unfinished tasks to another day without retyping it. This app has simplified my life. Thank you,
"An extraordinary, life changing, app. There are several excellent YouTube videos on how to really maximize the app under GTD type systems. I use three ""time based"" projects-- This week; Next week; Next month. Additionally, I tag things as ""Today"" when appropriate. Also super important is forwarding emails to my inbox and syncing google calendar. No kidding-- this app changed my life.",
"Recent versions drain battery like crazy Upd: sorry, this message was kept from previous review (with less stars), it looks like you fixed this issue. Currently the only unresolved need - is how to hide irrelevant task until specific time of day (like Snooze in GMail). When I set specific Due Time for task, it always appears above all others for current day, it is quite the opposite of what is expected.",
"It seems a bit complicated, at first, but once you start setting up tasks and projects, the utility becomes more apparent. I went ahead and bought premium. It's not that much and probably worth it for the reminder feature.",
Poor program. Installed it and on first start asked for email or google start up. Clicked on email address linked to phone's account. Waiting and wheel spin for 30 minutes without anything happening. Had to shut down via Close All in Recents. Tried it twice. Recommend other users not to install it. Uninstalled it.,
"Phenomenal organization & deep intuited interface. Love the ability to stream-of-thought tasks in via abstract language. Swipes and movement interfaces really play to the strengths of the mobile platform. Shame the premium features are a subscription. I would spring some $10-20 one time, but I despise subscriptions.",
"Ridiculously stupid user interface. Eg. I could not figure out why the tasks I was drafting would disappear mid-air when I tried adding a reminder. Today, I finally realised that if I set a reminder for a task, I have to use the back button of my phone to be able to go back to the menu where I was writing the task and complete it. However, if I use the back arrow button in the app, it erases the task I was writing with no warning. Makes no sense at all. Would not recommend.",
Very robust to-do app. I love the ability to collaborate and work on to-do items without finalizing or finishing that item. Also has various ways to organize to-do items to make it very organized and neat.,
"There are glitches in the Android app that aren't in the web app. (I love the web app) Would give this 5 stars if Todoist fixed them, and introduce a bug reporting feature so that bugs like these don't remain unfixed. Dragging subtasks is often glitchy and doesn't parent under the correct parent task, or just reorders back to original placement after I drag it to a parent task. The @ and # symbol rarely actually pops up with label auto recognition as I type like it does on the web app.",
"Let me keep this simple, I paid for a year. Then tried to find something cheaper. Spent a year trying out various task apps. Have now returned to Todoist, bit the bullet and paid ¬£35. The free version suits most people but I wanted the extras.",
"While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.",
"Paid version probably is good, but.... free version is seriously restricted. Does not live up to reviews, which I am now guessing are mostly premium users. A simple example, reminders cost. 4 colors included, but a simple other one costs. Etc",
"Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!",
"Wunderlist was better. They've ruined what was a great simple list app. It annoyingly emails you to tell you things each day that you havnt done, I was. using it as a shopping list!!! So Iv deleted my account, uninstalled it and gone back to Google notes. Shame, this is what happens when conpanies buy good independent apps and then stuff them up",
"The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated.",
"ive used it personally for 2 years. fantastic app works on my iPad, android and windows 10 machines and has a handy chrome extension. seriously has helped me stay organized and even become more disciplined with my time. cannot say enough good things. 12/10 would recommend.",
"I very rarely rate apps but I just have to show my appreciation for this app - it's fantastic. The recurring tasks are a great way for me to keep calm and not have to remember all the small things I need to do every day in my head. It's so easy to use and having it as a widget for a daily to do list is so helpful. Amazing job, developers! :)",
"I really like this app. The fact that there is no way to set the calendar display either as a widget or as the first thing that opens when you click on the app, really impedes my use of the app. If I could set the calendar as the first thing that popped up when I click on the app, I would be the happiest camper.",
"The developers understand the ""stay out of the way"" concept and it makes this a really great tool. Bonus points for the unified cross-platform experience and integration with Spark, very cool! Would live to see text labels added inside the swipe action so you know what you are about to do.",
"It took me a few tries to really implement this app. I have always loved Todoist, but I didn't have enough going on in my life to put an app like this to good use. Lately though, I've needed to organize several personal projects as well as tasks for work, doctor appointments, etc. So I turned back to Todoist. It's only gotten better... I will continue to use it daily! :))",
"Todoist is the best personal calendar and TODO list I have ever seen. It is also great for Shopping lists, reminders, appointment tracking, etc. It is especially useful if you want to see it on multiple devices.",
This has really been helpful. Having the extension on my chrome browser connect to the app on my phone is very convenient. easy to keep track of my assignments I need to do. It automatically syncs between the two.,
"Great app. Very useful and anyone in the team can input things to be done, sign dates, times and team member responsible. Lacking the ability to assign multiple people to a task rather than just one person, but that may be because I'm using the free version.",
"Working well so far, im using free version and it has many features that are helping me to stay organized. The multiple projects and levels of tasks (parent/child) are handy way to organize further. I am working three prat time jobs that i have to manage my tasks and time myself, and this app os helping a bunch!",
"I loved the widget but they removed a very useful feature: to be able to open the app from the widget. It's not possible to reorganize tasks from the widget, the only way is through the app. However now it has become bothering to open the app. I hope they will bring this feature back",
"After using every single famous to do app out there, in fact after creating my own webapp. I found the best thing out there. Pros: 1. Extensions, Add-ons: There is an add-on for everything under the sun. Extension for chrome, extension for opera, add-on for gmail, heck add-on for outlook as well. 2. The regex feature of adding deadline by just typing ""next Wednesday"" Super cool. 3. Ability to add repeating task like ""read a random chapter from Statistics by Kirk every six days from next Fri"" !",
"I like it okay, so far. But I'm flabbergasted at one behavior. I entered the task ""Do house clean this early evening"". Todoist DELETED the words ""this early evening"" and arbitrarily scheduled a time. I didn't want that. I tried to read-add the text, but it kept deleting it and scheduling the job for 7 pm. The only way I could have time information remain in the task name was to misspell it! I changed ""early evening"" to ""earli evening"". It worked, but it's ridiculous.",
Great app! I get more done in my day. It helps me remember things that I need to do during my day that I usually forget about. I get to focus on one thing at a time vs feeling overwhelmed. I purchased the premium version and I think it is worth it. I can even assign a task to a someone who is collaborating with me in a project.,
"So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day.",
"I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?",
"Horrible. I have MS and bad memory issues so was hoping this would help keep me on task. Put about 15 tasks in, didnt ""swipe"" to complete, but they disappeared and were marked as complete. Couldnt see them again unless I get Premium version!",
"This is the only to do app that I've kept up working with for so long. So, it's really handful for someone who's not accustomed to ""to-do lists"". However, there's a minor problem to it: when you put a colon in front of a task, you can't mark it as done anymore. I'd be happy to see it fixed up in the next updates.",
"Please allow more complexity in setting recurring tasks for example daily routine go to bed at 10pm ev weekday and go to bed at 12am ev fri, sun. It's frustrating having to create multiple tasks for the same recurring task just because I want it set to a different time. Will leave my review at 1 star and upgrade to 5 once fixed. Look forward to any updates from Devs on this one.",
have been using the app since my undergraduate days in college. I wish there was an audio feedback while ticking the checklists in the task just like in wunderlist. There's a need of more integrations special with Microsoft business account.,
"This app is my best bud! I've been using this app for almost a year now and I'm very satisfied. However, there is a lit bit issue in using the Todoist widget, I can't directly open my todo's from the widget sooo I had to go open the app instead. Though, it's not a big issue for me but I hope this can be solve hihi. (but maybe my phone is the problem?) Anyways, Keep up the Good work!‚úã",
I've never been very organized and todo lists often go blank. Todoist is easy enough that making a list doesn't feel like a burden or a waste of time. I've been using it for about 3mo now consistently.,
it would be incredible if we could set up when our day ends instead of auto reset at midnight. For those of us who stay up late it would help tremendously with the gamification of the app. Thats why i put 4 stars. Thank you for an amazing app regardless üôè,
"The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great. Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
"Still learning how to use it, but so far so good! I like how you can set up daily, weekly, etc. tasks to be recurring so you don't have to constantly re-add them. My one complaint is that setting tasks for specific dates that aren't tomorrow or next week is a bit tricky.",
beautiful app. very simple to use but also has a lot of features. I especially love being able to subsubtask my subtasks and subsubsubtask my subtasks. the only criticism is that the reminder feature is hidden behind paywall. it would be better if only customizations were a paid features or if there was a one time paid option instead of monthly.,
Todoist has been great. But what would be great is to not be faced daily with a to do list widget that's incapacitated by a refresh circle. Never was a problem until recently. Now I'm in a spot where I would just leave the widet in its useless state because of how much I just want the widget to show me what I need without a prodding from an opened app. Looks like I'll be trying some other means that has never disappeared on me this whole time.,
"App is not for me. I paid $4.00 for 1 month of Premium service and is still shows I am using the free app. I immediately contacted customer service (twice), and it's been more than 2 weeks into the 1 month I paid for and I still have not received a response from anyone at Todoist. I'm still trying to figure out how to customize this app to suit my needs, but since I don't have the Premium app in order to do that, I will be uninstalling this app.",
"it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick.",
"This app is life changing. I'm terrible at organizing and keeping myself on track, but Todoist has changed all of that. With a little bit of habit building, I'm more organized than I've ever been and less stressed. I cannot recommend this app enough.",
"I am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks/projects I have scheduled, so I end up missing out on things I want to take care of. I have it turned on in Settings. Why is that?... I utilize the Smart Schedule tool, but still no notification. Pls help or fix.",
"Great app, now I put down every single plan which comes to my mind and there is easier to manage it and make it complete. I haven't tested premium yet, but I think it would be even more helpeful to reach the goals.",
"I thought this app was just ok, then I learned about the smart scheduling. Being able to schedule a task in for 'every Tuesday' or 'on the 25th of every month' really revolutionized my to do list. Now this app is indispensable.",
"The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you.",
"It works pretty well, particularly in shared tasks and in linking to Android Assistant. I find the interface to not be as i would like, but that might just be me not knowing how to use it the most efficiently.",
"The UX for this app is way beyond similar apps like Google keep and one note. The user interface is also very intuitive. the organization system is also to an extent is manipulable to the users need, which is fantastic. really well designed",
"It looks like it will run smoothly with helpful features, and I like how clean and simple UI is. I'm a bit disappointed I won't get reminders without Pro though? I'm worried this app will be near useless for my goldfish memory if I don't pay for the membership. :/ Am I missing something?",
"This app is changing my life! I started slow but once you get going it's almost addictive and karma points for completing tasks on time were a real nice surprise. Enjoy this app alot and highly recommend it, very easy to use and convenient.",
"App is easy to use and helps me stay focused on my goals, both personal and professional. The reminders are a great bonus and syncing with Google Calendar makes it so I can track my Todoist tasks alongside the events recorded in Calendar.",
"Todoist was good enough for me, but I was a free tier user. Recently I discovered that my todo list is growing because I eventually forget things that are in the list. A feature to get reminders is behind the paywall. Todo list without a reminder? Please give reminders for free tier too, you can monitize in other ways like advanced stats etc",
"Don't know if there's a paid version, but the free one is fully functional and without any ads. It would be exactly what I need... if not for the fact that whenever I add new item or try to change order of tasks on a list, some other tasks also randomly change their place on a list. It is a dealbreaker for me, as I sort things in specific order to do them in that exact order. edit: I am talking about a bug in project view. others have the same problem from what I've gathered.",
"Maybe it works for some people, but this was absolutely the worst 'to do list' app I have tried! Every time I opened it, therr was a 'feature' blocking my use. The ultimate problem was finding no task delete function.",
"its easy to use and works across multiple platforms. you can colour code and add as many categories with the premium version. i use it for work meetings and for personal use, it has helped me manage numerous projects so far! highly recommended",
"I had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks, 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens. Also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk. Poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers.",
I've tried a bunch of these to-do apps. This one gives you the most for free. You can sync two devices on the free tier. Phone and laptop are enough for most people. No ads no pushy upgrade messages.,
"Intuitive UI, nothing essential is stripped away for free use. Would be 5 starr except for no calendar view for events, or any view with easy-access more than 7 days out - makes it difficult at a glance to see jf setting up a meeting a month away would conflict with, say, a Doctor's appointment.",
"This App has really transformed the way i go about my routine life. it helped me declutter and minimize daily stress.it can be improved further however by letting users reorder the day's tasks and setting deadlines to individual tasks, which offcourse require more time to be completed. it should also introduce its own calender within the app to enable users to look at their activities in a broader context.",
"Paying a monthly fee is not acceptable IMO. I would gladly pay a one time fee for it. I still use apps from years ago that are still used from one phone to the next. If I had to pay a monthly fee to keep those this whole time would be way too much for what they're worth. This is a good app, with plenty of features, but not worth $36 a year.",
"A task management system is crucial in my system so I don't forget things and Todoist fulfills all of my needs, even with a basic account. The smart auto-text recognition when typing in tasks is also very useful at reducing the time it takes for new tasks to be entered so I'm more likely to keep updating and using this system.",
I am very satisfied with this App. I does what i expected it to do including reminding about the things to do ans repeating tasks every month. I also love how it is super easy to use and even easier to type in the Task with predictive dates and stuff Overall great app!,
"This app has pretty much the best NLP system from all competitors, very easy to add new tasks quickly. One of the places it could improve is for notifications. Having quick actions for notifications (+15 min, next day, etc) would be very useful (similar to what TickTick does for notification)",
"The GREATEST personal organization app I have used. Cool and simple user experience, works on all major platforms so you can access your lists from virtually anywhere. If you are looking for a way to get organized and productive, this what you are looking for.",
"They want you to pay a premium for reminders. You gotta be kidding me. A premium membership. For a ""to do list"" app. What has this world come to. Also it has you log in with your Google account or email. I downloaded a couple other to do list apps that don't require a login, and don't require a premium membership for reminders.",
"Generally pretty good, but a lot of awkward design choices: no compact mode, inefficient use of colors for organization, difficulty selecting and moving tasks, lack of icon consistency, preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself.",
"Best task scheduling app. And I've tried many. I'm using it to break long term goals into smaller incremental goals, and to handle recurring housrhold tasks. Sadly, no task app can stop me from over-committing myself to too many tasks on a daily basis...",
"So I've cancelled the subscription and it showed me that I have premium until December 20-ish, imagine my surprise when it charged me for next month anyway. I asked support for a refund but they said it's impossible, ""but you can use our app for one more month"". Well, I didn't want to. I don't see any feature to unbind my card either, so I am afraid I need to delete account to make sure this bloody app won't charge me again against my will. For not allowing refunds and no unbind - 1 star.",
"I don't consider reminders as premium features, if you could make it as a single feature purchase I would definitely buy that. The other features are okay and the price is good, but reminders are just unnecessarily premium. Besides from being available for Linux, I don't find anything unique in Todoist that others doesn't have.",
"This app IS great, and has the potential to be greater! However, my only 2 requests is when you add a ""Parent Project"" to your ""Favorites,"" please include the projects within it as well! And to also make setting alarms to your tasks more simple, and reliable. Thanks!",
"Latest update has a bug rendering it useless - in certain projects, noticeably once marked as ""Favourites"", when tapping ""add task"", nothing happens. Huawei Honor 10. Edit: They fixed it. Thanks. Excellent app and responsive team üòÅ",
"Great app, using it all the time... Would be great to have a toggle for switching on and off the view of the completed tasks in ""today"" mode. This motivates even more, if you see how many things you accomplished today...",
"Spam!!!!. Trying to remove the notification on the email for the past month after uninstalling the app, and it doesn't allow me. Asking to install the app again, and it didnot work for me. How many times I need to xlick tje option to remove the notification? I get 2 emails of due tasks *EVERYDAY*, SO Annoying. =oI",
"the interface is so unintuitive. why does the ""submit"" button have an icon of a paper airplane making it look like a ""send"" button. Reschedule? I'm not rescheduling i'm actually adding the time and date for the task and so on....",
"Excellent app, in my opinion the best productivity app out there. Simple and intuitive user interface and it integrates with anything else you can think to pair it with (Google Calendar, Gmail, etc.). It's the easiest to use and most effective app I use daily.",
I use it for writing things I need to do later. I like how you can priorities items and set due dates. I also like the feature of repeating task. It is easy to use. intuitive. great way to get organised.,
Good interface. Will not sync shared projects between devices (Web and Samsung S9+). Followed all troubleshooting steps provided on website. Syncs correctly when using web interface. Good app for those who are using the web interface.,
"The app is very good, but after the change in scheduling settings the feature is not convenient at all. Each time I need to schedule the task to a certain time - it's a torture.",
"its pretty good, very functional. a cool widget that makes it easy to see your tasks. i wish i could opt out of the emails. and i wish they had a set up for late tasks that was less anxiety indusing. it has a good grouping feture, and a good repeating task feture",
"Worth paying for premium. This app helped me organize my life and breaks down big scary projects into simple tasks. The interface is a little confusing at first, but when you learn it, its extremely helpful. Cant recommend this app enough",
"Useful app. Easy to use and handy. EXCEPT - the Todoist calendar only shows the NEXT occurence of a recurring task, not ALL recurrences. This is a recipe for a scheduling conflict, and big omission for an app like this.",
Makes keeping track of everything so much easier! Worth the subscription. I love that I can capture things I need to do in seconds - then later come back and figure out where those things fit in my overall plan.,
I am very impressed with Todoist. I've been using Google Tasks which was nowhere near as flexible. Being able to organize across projects with priorities and easy rescheduling makes this app very effective at helping me stay organized.,
"An awesome way to get organized, STAY organized, and feel like you actually accomplished something with your day! It's easy to use, has boatloads of useful features, and has honestly improved my productivity so very much. Would 100% recommend!",
"Seems like a really good app but just did not suit my needs. As someone with adhd, reminders are essential and to have them locked behind a pay wall is just quite useless. Without reminders I don't even remember to open the app throughout the day. But still a very good app, just not quite for me.",
"It took me 2 days to notice the ""show completed tasks"" command. Until then I couldn't see how to use this app as a Journal (I.e. looking into the past), not just a planning tool, and had started looking for another app that would do both. To use this app as a diary, you type your diary entry as the name of a new task, assign it to Today (so that it will be displayed with the date) in a special project e.g. ""Diary"" (can only be done before the task is completed) and click the box to complete it.",
"Great for organizing and planning your tasks. Also the app is very responsive, even on an older phone. No wait time, no frustration, just add tasks within seconds, right from your phone's home screen",
"needs a dedicated habit tracking tab, one where you can see your history. Unlike a task, it would be nice to see a habit tracking history. Besides this, one of the best productivity apps out there. üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ",
Super app... Can keep tracks of different types of lists really well... Just one thing I wish they had the slide and add more things in a section even in the today tomorrow next week lists It would make the process faster Than choosing the date in the calender again n again.,
Amazing. It feels really premium and polished even for the free version and they don't make it so core functionality needs to be paid for. I have been using it for years and would make this the must download app for everyone.,
"This app is AWESOME! I love how convenient it is to setup quick projects and tasks. i do wish we could share more than projects. I want to make and share a simple grocery list, having to make a ""Project"" list for that seems silly, buuuuut thats just verbage. love it, thank you for the wonderful app!",
"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools.",
"There is an issue in this app where comments dont show up on mobile app but you can see it on desktop or web. I have to logout from the app for the comments to appear. This happens every now and then. When it happens, I just need to logout and login but I find that inconvenient. Pls fix.",
Been using the free version for a few days. Very good functionality. Was previously using Google keep. The ability to divide tasks by project and the ability to assign priorities are clear improvements.,
"Excellent way to keep organized. More features in the free tier and better customer service than competitors. As soon as they implement automatic dark mode, it will be everything I could ask for.",
"I've put all the productivity apps through their paces and ToDoist is the clear winner for me. Its biggest strength is it's ability to be adapted to many different workflows and ways of thinking. Too many other apps seem limited in that domain. Currently it works very well as part of the GTD system for me. Highly recommend premium, especially for a GTD setup.",
"OK so I have tried a few and this looks to be a well rounded feature rich app that probably does everything I want it to do. I easily integrated it to my Trello board via a power up, nice. Ok so lets set a reminder for my first task! Seriously, reminders are Pro only pffff. Laters.",
"been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better. it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context, add a label and move to a different project.",
"So far enjoying the app. Only complaint is that in Board view, if you swipe up/down just a few degrees from vertical it interprets it as a horizontal swipe. Not a deal breaker, just annoying. Thanks!",
"As a digital product designer I especially find the user experience on this app phonemenal, everything I think of every feature, how it works, where it's placed is exactly the way I want it to be and this only tells you that the user testing team did their job and conducted their interviews. This app is a blessing to have, an app that states boldly the outcome when all parts involved do it right. Just an admirable piece of user experience I fortunately get to use everyday.",
"Integrates nicely with web version. Some of the tagging and organization is more intuitive in a browser, but it's still a great little to do list app. I love how effective the repeat scheduling features are.",
Have used Todoist over many other organizers for quite a while now. Current version has a bug that prevents me from turning off the morning reminder so I've had to disable all notifications. The free version limit on boards coming out of nowhere was pretty awful too.,
"I've been using this app for three years and it has changed my life. At a certain level they could create more milestones for goals achieved and hope they keep building this, but for now it's what I recommend often for anyone trying to get more disciplined at their ü•Ö.",
"Fits GTD model like a glove. Simple, easy to use, functional, multiplatform, intuitive gem of an application. The only thing I would add is geo-tagging of tasks for location based notifications. EDIT: just realized geo tagging is here as well. üòÇ",
"This was really good until the app just stopped working. You'd start the app and just get a black black page, ending up with warning message after warning message saying that the app had stopped working. Tried restarting the app and the phone and the message wouldn't stop appearing.",
"Great app! I have an issue with updating a widget on homescreen. The days in ""coming"" mode didn't update until I tap on some of the tasks. Previously, everything was updated without problems and unnecessary interactions.",
"This is the best to-do app I've tried. I love being able to organize my tasks into color-coded folders. It works great both on mobile and desktop. The reminder function is well worth paying for, and the cost is very reasonable.",
"Spent about 5h on creating tasks. Verified before closing, everything was there, was nicely saved. The next day I discover that there are no tasks ... Just 5h of working in vain. And the interesting thing, there is nothing in trash or in history as well. Horrible app",
"I really like the app and how easy it is to organize projects. The only thing I would want added is that tasks due on a specific day can be seen on the calendar when picking due dates for tasks, instead of just their colour code.",
"I was never satisfied with any ToDo app. I always wanted something which was missing. I don't know what it was but it wasn't satisfying. But this changed the game. ToDoist is by far the best task management app, I have ever used. The way it is designed gives very satisfying experience. I am 100% satisfied with the product.",
"Todoist has been improving I would love to see an optimization of the ""Share"" image as comment. It has bugs and fails regularly. Example : When saving a screenshot to a project on Android. I usually recieve a notification saying that it failed.",
Very flexible interference that can fit almost everyone. I highly recommend everyone who have anything that he needs to do to use this app as you can diverge and manage your things very easily with this app very easy to understand but also extremely powerful tool of filters if you're a pro user,
"This is a really helpful app for personal use. I like just having basic to do lists for each day. I would like a better calendar view though, so I could use it instead of Google calendar. I am trying to build habits and routines, and this app is good for setting recurring tasks.",
Easy to use and effective. I have become more productive ever since I began using it. Access to my list on my phone or computer proves very useful especially at times when my phone was unavailable. Highly recommend to anyone trying to create structure in their lives.,
"My personal favorite task manager. Natural language has a bit of a learning curve, so if there is a feature you expected it is likely accessible via the natural language task input. A dark theme and cross-platform features also elevate it above the competition.",
I'm disabled so detailed planning and recording tasks is vital! Tried many apps and like Todoist enough for day to day I got Pro. + Sync with GCal [Home + Gmail] + Fairly easy to use + Cross platform - subtasks (STs) that recur. e.g.  'Accounts' has 8 STs. If STs set to recur ALL of them show up in GCal (month view) but if not I must add them every time (or do/undo which breaks my task count). - no journal option - complicated export - can't mark tasks as done on previous day,
"Great app! Easily share lists with others. Easy to add or check off items. One enhancement request would be to make another default view option the list of all projects, rather than having to choose one project to default view.",
"New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise.",
"I've tried multiple Productivity apps and the learning curve has always been pretty steep. Not so much with Todoist! A smooth UI and lots of , but not too much, functionality. Great work developers",
"Amazing app, clean layout, no ads. Helps me put my thoughts onto a list and get things done. Have recommended to family and friends when I hear they're still using pen and paper. Love the cross platform support. App available on all platforms, even Linux.",
Super simple but lifesaving app. I don't really like using phone calendars to plan out my day because there are too many useless features and it takes very long to set everything up. But when I downloaded Todoist I started planning everything.,
"Todoist is garbage. Nevermind the idiotic text-based method for creating daily tasks, this stupid app seems to think ""every day"" is a suggestion, even with Premium. Been using this app for three weeks & every few days, it refuses to renew my daily tasks. Scheduled reminders disappear. Curse & blast whoever EOL'd Wunderlist cuz it was perfect for my needs. This todoist trash? Not at all. I will cling to Wunderlist until the very end.",
"I've never paid for a productivity app until I started using Todoist. It is THE BEST task management app out there. Simple, clean, beautifully designed, easy to use, and packed with features. Definitely recommend it.",
Lots of great features while remaining simple and easy to use. Works great across platforms. I love the new update it added features and tightened up the UI without making arbitrary changes or feeling bloated.,
Great App! being able to track down and see the tasks you've accomplished is so great! that's why I really love it 'coz its make me more productive. But I was hoping you can add the Pomodoro technique to make users more productive and will be able to track how much time will we spent on a task.,
"As a genius, it was one of the most useful apps I've ever used in my entire life! Everything is pretty simple; complicated things are also made of a lot of simple parts; and this app allowed me to manage my complicated tasks! Just imagine you could manage a huge marriage ceremony just by using this app, thinking! Or an essay, a school project, plan for a journey, your goals, your dates and everything! This app just made me wondered! And I'm really speechless for more! It's a masterpiece! üëçüôèüòá",
"Favorite to do list let! It is cross platform, cloud based, and there are short cuts for everything so my to dos can get easily organized at the task or project level and cover both timing and priority needs. Love this service!",
"12 hours, just 12 hours I had this app. Received 6 emails for todoist. Why do you think it is acceptable to bombard me with email? On top of the email issue, to make any real use of this app you have to sign up for the premium service. Wont be coming back. Uninstalled and you been added to my junk email list. Pathetic!",
"The most intuitive & simple function is to be able set tasks. Create the task w a description, then choose the frequency & specific days. I can't create a simple daily task for Monday through Friday without creating a weekly task for each of those 5 days. An app lacking that simple function creating more work for the user is one I can't get behind using. Nothing in help section resolved this most basic issue. If that capability exists its impossible to find. 30 minutes & I'm giving up.",
"Been loving it so far until recent update, I don't get the ""UNDO"" prompter anymore when I ""accidentally"" completed a task! SUGGESTION: Can we have a ""Recently Completed Tasks"" in the Navigation Menu please? (I believe this is consistent with many input by other reviewers/users/customers ~.^) 1 week's worth of it is good enough. Thank you!",
"the interface is easy and very slick. helps me and getting things done. rescheduling a task as a breeze. changing priority or sequence of tasks for the day is also very easy, just a drag and shift.",
"Very easy to use, and does the things I want it to. It's worth learning the text entry shortcuts for things like due date and project. I also find the premium features to be worth having.",
"Todoist Allows you to carefully plan your activities and be accountable for their completion. Also, if you remember an undone chore, you can quickly put it into the app and the likelihood of you doing that thing tripples.",
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer.",
"Good App. Make it better still. We need: 1. Recurrent task/reminders. Need to set a daily or weekly reminder for a task, not just a deadline or completion date. Also it would allow to set a reminder for regular daily routines (exercise, meditation, language' etc) 2. WhatsApp integration. The reminders appear as Whatsapp message (optional). Many people still use WhatsApp for projects ans business. 3. Alternatively, Share options to distribute tasks by email, whatsapp, etc",
"Please, make the widget minimalistic like in com.stuff.todo. upd: new widgets are far better than b4. looking forward for the ability 2 chnge fonts/opacity (roboto thin/condensed light = great; montserrat too). also would b great 2 have an option 2 make tags invisible + changin color accents to custom/theme aligned like red dates etc (and/or make it grab the accent from bg picture). compact view is not an option, I like the orig spacing. last 1: cut off the header, widgt cusomizes while creation",
"I love so many things about this app: the cross platform support, the responsive interface, the project segments, and the inbox organization. I use this for so many things now, and may consider subscribing the longer I use it",
"Very happy with Todoist after trying various. Easy to pick up and the nice widgets to display and quick add have very quickly become part of my routine, and stuck. Others have lacked smoothness in that area, best I've tried.",
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker.",
"Its a great app and encourages productivity. A nitpick i have with the newest update is that the ""sorted by due date"" still appears in the widget screen, and is kind of annoying. It would be nice if that is removed, thanks!",
"Great all-around app. Free features are enough for most users, though thete are some nice premium perks for upgrading. Love being able to create items using natural voice. This app is tough to beat. I keep trying other apps and always return here.",
"Simple but powerful and I can use it with Google Home! If you download the IFTTT app, you can integrate the two and add tasks to your default list or add items to your shopping list. Works on your phone by voice or on Google home. And the app itself is great.",
"I have been having a great experience with the app. I love how I make updates on my PC, and they reflect on all my other devices. So handy, and it's made me so much more productive both at work, and at home! I also really like the flexibility of the widget.",
"This isn't your mother's to do list. It has many layers and after 3 weeks I still feel as though I'm learning how to fully use it. Having said that, you can make it as simple or as detailed as you wish. I already feel more on top of things and look forward to learning how to maximize the benefits of Todoist. Use the tutorials.",
"Too Expensive. I was going to use this for managing my business and my sons education. However, I am not going to pay $8 a month per person using that app when I there are perfectly free good apps that do the same. Do not recommend. I mean honestly, it's not that complex keeping track of tasks, and I am not going to pay a subscription fee for a to do app.",
"This helps me to be so much more organized! Huge improvement over my random pieces of paper and lists all over the place. It's simple, fluid, and easy to use. (Written after one week of use.)",
"If it were a one off payment for the premium version, I'd pay it in a heartbeat, but who (apart from a very rich person) would pay ¬£36 per year, amounting to ¬£180 to use some extra features on a phone app for 5 years? No thanks!",
I paid for the pro and of course they make it a pain to cancel. The tasks and reminders take way too many buttons to press and it doesn't even sound an alarm or anything just a notification. I bought this because i need something better than Google calendar but its worse because you have to pay.,
Indispensible. I use this to keep both my professional and personal life organized. I find the calendar integration to be very helpful. I also sync both calendar and Todoist to the Momentum dashboard extension for Chrome.,
Very good so far! I have been playing around with this for a week and have found it useful but not annoying with reminders and access via multiple devices. really like how you can group projects too.,
"I really can't speak to the full experience, because I do not have the premium version, but so far the free version has helped me with keeping my projects and tasks in one place. I am still getting the hang of prioritizing, but that is more of a personal thing.",
"+ Simple, pretty, you can make folders, it works cross plattform which is really importany for me. - Sometimes it bothers me that it converts some text automatically into dates and it doesn't seem you can turn it off. e i wish i could just write ""thursday",
"No Reminders. After installation and setting and adding entire to do list with reminders, I missed couple of important calls. When I checked why I didn't get a reminder, app mag said reminders are only available in PRO version. Why the hell are you not mentioning these things upfront? Ohh yes, coz then people won't download this shot.",
"It was one of the best tasks/project management apps. I loved it and used a lot. Now, after last updates mobile UI become completely unusable and inconvenient for me. A lot of space used in efficient way for ugly bottom app bar :(",
"I highly recommend Todoist. Easy to add tasks and move them around as needed. Since it's on my phone and always by my side, I easily add tasks on the go by typing or by voice. Whenever I get overwhelmed with things that need to be done, I use Todoist to prioritize my day by assigning a 1, 2, 3 or 4 priority.",
"I've been using todoist with my team for while and now I have to ditch it because it has many bugs and they often don't get fixed quickly enough. Basic things like syncing often have issues for some reason, and it's very painful to use it.",
I love this app! It keeps all my projects and tasks organised and helps me to stay in control. Really easy to use and once you've set everything up it keeps you on track. Highly recommended.,
This app has been super helpful for me in organizing my tasks on a daily basis. Is there any way you can integrate a feature that shows completed tasks? It would be great for keeping track in projects or just the feeling of completion and being productive that is very rewarding for the user. Thank you!,
"I've been using Todoist for about 2 weeks now. In that time I've gone from post it notes and the apple reminders app on my phone to everything on Todoist. One of the great things for me is that I can create ""projects"" for general day to day things that need doing and I can also create ""projects"" for work tasks that need to be done. The app refreshes seemlessly on my phone when I'm ticking off my shopping list and on my desktop in the office checking off daily tasks. Big thumbs Todoist!",
Add habit track and focus mode just like in tick tick app (your competitors). Over all I like tick tick more because of these features but because that company is based in China really concerned about data protection laws. That is the only reason I will stick with todoist. Pls add gamified habit track and focus mode,
"This is a great app that has sharing of tasks and recurrence. It took me a long time to find the exact thing for what we needed for a household chores, and this is perfect! it also has great integration across multiple platforms.",
"it's hard to edit tasks because it doesn't have multi select. also hope that I can see a proper calendar in here. and I can't turn my sub tasks as a main task and vise versa. Edit: I see, I couldn't multi-select because I was trying to hold the task to select it. But the subtasks in projects, they're all nested inside the main task, I can't move them. I can change the subtasks in the inbox tho.",
"Simple & Sweet. No unnecessary clutter - just things I need to do, organised by category and date. Slick interface and cool date parsing are highlights. Can also integrate with Google Home but I didnt find much use for that.",
"I have been using this app for a few weeks, and it has been a tremendous help in making me organized and less stressed. I love the user interface. I can create a task, set its due date, its priority, and its category (project) all from the keyboard. However, I wish that I could look farther ahead than 7 days. When I schedule a task to a day two weeks from now, I want to see what specific things I have going on that day (not just how many tasks) so that I can make sure that I can do it then.",
"I've been enjoying the app. I love how I can easily set recurring tasks. There's just one thing I wish I could change. I wish I could change the hour at which a new day begins. I know that sounds weird, but I am a night owl and usually don't go to bed until after midnight. Before I settle down for the night, I like to review my day and check off tasks that I forgot to check off earlier. But by the time I do that, it is technically a new day and the tasks are automatically marked overdue.",
Awesome app. Best of all the apps I've used. Just one suggestion- please add a feature that allows the user to add an image like a cover image for each project. It would look more good aesthetically.,
"App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features.",
greaaaaaat app. Should support more languages for shortcuts and make icons instead of colours for projects (or make both options possible). Reminders would be great to have for free and monthly payments are a bit too much for me... a one time payment would be best,
"Some functions are frustrating. I was trying to enter tasks as theyre described in an assignment with things like part a, b, or c, but it always changed anything with a part ""a"" to a time. If I manually changed it so there was no time, it deleted the rest of the text.",
"Makes a less-than-good first impression on new users by makng word input as scheduling as cryptic as possible and having no undo for marking things done, or way of looking up what you accidentally marked as done. A pain in the neck in many ways.",
"This app is amazing! üíï Everything is much easier with this app, you can easily organize all of your tasks, and you can set schedule, reminders, even prioritize those tasks. It is very simple but helpful! üíñ Definitely my fav productivity app ever üòç",
"Today (9/19) my filters have disappeared. They are still present and functioning on my computers but not on my phone. The dev asked if I would try logging out and back in. Yesterday and again today I tried just force stopping the app, and that didn't work. Logging out and back in did work. Back to normal.",
Hands down the best task management platform ever. Use it for work and personal stuff. It's a bit dangerous as it can become a crutch: these days if it doesn't go on todoist it doesn't get done. But this is a testament to the quality of the app. Can't wait for boards!,
"thank you so much please never go away hmm suggestion though is the ability to add more than one subtasks at a time. every time i add one, i had to select the task every single time. so that would be really useful, if that feature is already there too and i just didnt know about it, i apologize.",
Great app across multiple platforms. my only quibble is I have to turn the smart date function on and off as it's not very totally reliable. I would like to be able to the smart date function on and off as needed in each task,
Definitely needs a way to have a daily to-do list. Add a feature where I can put items like 'make bed' and 'meditate' as daily tasks and not have to type them in everyday and it's a 5 star app. Just looking for a way to open the app and start chocking daily tasks off without making a long list everyday over and over.,
Good but I must activate the pro version to get a lot of features. The free version does not make it easy to use because it makes no distinction between freemium and paid features in the UI.,
This is a great and simple app to organize tasks and projects. If there was one area that could use improvement it would be the need to visualize tasks in a in-app calendar or gantt view.,
"This is one of those amazing, rare apps, that I had to leave a review for. It has pretty much everything I could think of, presented in a very sleek design with customisable widgets. Just download it and see for yourself!",
"Todoist has always been useful whenever I purposefully open the app. It is only now when I ""explored"" a bit and figured how I could simply add it to my notification panel or even highlight and share a word and immediately export it to the app is when I realized how convenient it really is üòÅ. What can I say, I'm a noob with technology lol",
Forced to update the app only to be charged for labels. Stop charging for things that used to be free. The app barely does anything with the free version. It's getting to the point that the default notes app in your phone is more competent than this app,
"Have been using the app for several years now, just love the simple interface, and most importantly the reliability of the app and synchronization across platforms. Highly recommended",
"Very nice app that helps you organize your tasks and time. Links with Google calendar for the best experience. Has a pro version with a monthly payment, but is still very useful without.",
"Good functionally but slow app. The widget almost never updates, and the app itself lags heavily on ticking off items. This didn't used to be the case but is also true for the Windows app to now. Unless this is improved I doubt I'll be resubbing.",
I've tried a few to do list apps and this is the best by far. The amount of features you get is fantastic. Homescreen widget is the icing on the cake along with cross platform support with Linux!,
"Numerous bugs exist. The main one affecting me is once you've added a task, it is impossible to amend it as the changes you make will not be saved. Try to change a one-off task due today into a repeating daily task, it recognises the modification by changing the font, but then you click save and nothing happens.",
"Irritating. Can't say more than one word for your list, goats cheese comes up as goats. No more than 3 items per list on the ""board"" I deleted my tasks before adding sub items by tapping them. Monday board is easier to use than this, with videos to show you how to do it on youtube.",
"I've tried a ton of different ""to do"" apps, planners, calendars, etc...and this is one of my favorites because it's clean, easy to understand, doesn't have tons of extra things going on - it sticks to what you need instead of trying to jam pack everything into one app - and it's extremely affordable for the premium version....which is, in my opinion, a must have.",
"using the free todoist account with the app. the app works great, provides a nice clean interface and is for the most part doing exactly what it should. would recommend as a todo app, it even has a nice widget to use on your home screen",
"incredible app. feature suggestion: a swipe-enabled task tracker feature (swipe to open on-screen list) like Xiaomi's ""Quick Notes"" feature. tried switching to their app just for that feature, but it just wasn't as sophisticated as Todoist.",
This is the most extremely useful tool I've found in my third month of my first ever semester in college. It really pushes me to the tasks I need to do. It is very helpful. I use this in both my phone and laptop. I highly recommend this app especially to college students. Thank you devs for making such an outstanding program! üòÄüòÄüòÄ,
Its a great app and functionality is great BUT only when it works. Lately its been crashing regularly and using it has been a struggle to the point where its unusable. I'll edit my review once this persistent crashing issue is sorted.,
Nice and intuitive interface. Items/tasks are synced across devices. Great solution for organizing and filtering items. Also optional reminders are possible for more important items. No issues/bugs after 2 months of usage. Easy 5/5!,
"I am over the moon elated and happy with this app. I had to leave, more or less, another app that I had jury-rigged to accomplish To Do management. I'm glad that happened because it forced me to investigate apps like Todoist and I will not look back! Todist is simple yet exceedingly powerful. There's lots of collateral on YouTube and elsewhere in addition to the extensive help documents that come with the product to help you really customize it to your precise use case. I'm an avid, raving fan",
I have tried so many todo list applications and Todoist is my favourite todo list app and will be continued as so. Tackling daily tasks with Todoist is straightforward and easy. The integration with Google Calender is really amazing and I loved it as I were able to be more productive altoghether with Google Calender and managing tasks and todos with Todoist. Highly recommended for anyone.,
"This app came highly recommended from software dev friends. It boasts a remarkably intuitive user interface, stays in sync between desktop & mobile, and i've yet to hit any paywall bs; just simply the best to-do list application i've ever used.",
"Loving this app! To me, the best feature is the ability to break down complex tasks into smaller sub tasks, each of which can have their own due dates and priority. Makes it so much easier to make progress and complete projects. Thanks for such a great level of detail!",
I've been using it for just over a year now. it's apart of me now. thanks for upping the limit 300. breaking them up in to different projects is good and all but you lose two sync google calendar ability.,
"Keeps me on top of my tasks every day for the last 5 years. It's a great experience, works as advertised and intended, and I love the natural language features (e.g. ""Take out the trash every Mon 8pm starting Dec 1 until June 15""). One improvement would be to add duration so your integrated calendar could use this information better ‚Äì because ""today at 8pm"" in Todoist is a due date but for Google or Outlook calendar is a starting time for an 1-hour event.",
"Very solid task manager, really like the natural language method of entering tasks. It has the easiest method of creating recurring tasks I have found. Integration with Google Calendar is a plus. I like the clean interface.",
"I live my life by this app. I will forget EVERY thing I need to do if Todoist doesn't remind me that I need to do it. That is why I am so frustrated lately with this app. Every day I have many, many tasks that I need to know about. It seems recently that I get MAYBE 5% of them. At the end of the day I will check Todoist on my android device (Samsung Note 20 Ultra) but when I look at the list in Todoist, there are like 30 missed tasks marked in red but I NEVER got any notification.",
"I'm experiencing bugs when using widgets. The task will disappear and I can't add on it (No tasks match the current sorting options). To fix it, I need to remove and add the widget again. I'm using ""sorted by due date"", I'm not sure if it's the same with the other sorting options. I'm using Android 11.",
"Very poor sync between app and Google Calendar. Even though udates are getting pushed from Google Calendar (i.e. showing in browser version) but not received even after 30 minutes on app version. Developer please look into this. Edit: it is working well now, i am watching you üëÄ üòÇ",
"Love this app! Todoist, can you please add a feature for me? You can put it on Pro only. I really would like to be able to adjust what time a ""new day"" starts. Sometimes I'm up past midnight and complete some daily tasks after midnight, but it messes it all up because they don't show up for the next day because technically I've already completed them that day. I'd like the app to start a ""new day"" at, say, 3am instead of midnight. Can you add that please?",
"Todoist has allowed me to outsource my brain of all the chores, errands, and reminders that were constantly taking up real estate in my thoughts. I never have to worry about when I'm going to the grocery store, when to do laundry, or when my next oik change needs to be, etc. This app has allowed me to live a more efficient and intentional life. I recommend it to anyone that will listen to me.",
Todoist is legitimately my favorite to do list app I have ever used. It's what makes me aware of everything of what's going on or what i don't. I have a suggestion though. Can ya'll add a days/hours/mins away due feature where you can keep in track of how much time a task has left until due? That'll be great!,
"I have never had to write a list as I could always remember the order of the day. Now retired, I find I have a more divergent day and have too much to do to form a coherent picture. Enter Todoist. Just put everything that occurs to you in the inbox and sort the days/weeks jobs or each morning. prioritise, label - calls, emails.., order your day and tick off as you do. Set repeats, dates and times and reminders. Takes a bit of practice and discipline but it is excellent. Like a PA!",
"Suggestion: the repetitive task are not shown in the calendar for the entire duration. It would be nice if it is visible for the full duration (in the upcoming section, and also when scheduling a new task), so we know how my upcoming weeks look like",
"reply to developer: whatsapp continues to run in background and show notifications even after being closed. why are you unable to do that? .. original comment: I paid $4 for the reminders. However, reminders work only when the application is active. If you exit / shut-down the application, no reminders for you. Developer should design the application in such a way that it continues to run in background even when user exits it. I would like to have my money back unless this problem is rectified.",
I've been using todoist for the past 3 months to organized my uni life. Not going to lie but this apps has helped a lot in staying organized and stay focus on my prioritiesüôåüèª The interface is easy to adapt and use not only that it provides a lot of extension too such as Google calendar. Recommend everyone to try it out üòåüëåüèª‚ú®,
"overall great app. seeing if todoist could replace omnifocus which i have used for years. Pros - cross platform (windows, macOS, iOS, Android); Cons - can not set task durations, macOS users will that need to integrate with outlook will need some scripting to make work",
"Pretty exceptional. I wish the design choices between the mobile and the desktop platform were a little more consistent, but it's otherwise the one of the best todo-list apps out there.",
"Requires account to use.   I was just giving a simple reason why I didn't like it. But since your response indicates I don't have 10 seconds, then I'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand.  The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already.  Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that. That is what you need to understand, some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat. Downloaded ""Tasks: Todo List"" and been happy with it. Donated $1.99 to developer for making app for me and not their self.",
App is good esp. the language detection for date and time but the reminder / snooze function does not work properly. Needs to be persistent and not just move tasks to incomplete. I used a paid version. Now gone back to MS To Do.,
"Very disappointing considering how many people rave about this. The free version is too restrictive and paid version too expensive! It also has a kinda weird interface (in browser and app), which makes life difficult! Have deleted my account now.",
"Wow. WOW. And WOW! I've barely started. Just finished the getting started article and dang! The amount of effort put into this app and even the helpful personal tips along the way is fantastic! Just wanted to tip my hat to the individual(s) who put this together! Even more remarkably, it's free! HOW? This app just makes me wanna get things done lol Thanks so much!",
Great app! Easy to use. It has awesome challenges so you can compete with your friends. What I find interesting is that at the end of every year Todoist sends you an email showing you an overview of how your year went (what months were the most productive? What days and hours did you get the most done and what hours did you seem to move things around alot). It nice to know oh I'm more productive in the mornings etc...,
"A good option relative to what is out there. It's critical weakness is that it's complex to snooze items during the day, so you have difficulty doing zero inbox.  Update for programmer:  Thank you responding to my review.  One of the best features from Inbox was that you could snooze and email until a date AND time.  For example, I could have certain tasks appear in my inbox at 7AM for my morning's work, 1PM for what I tackle afternoons, and 5PM for home- and family-related stuff.  It was useful because I could schedule things to ping my attention at different times of day, and constant work to zero out my inbox.",
"[EDIT] Unfortunately since I wrote this review, Todoist has added pointless limitations and crippled the app - no more than 5 projects unless you pay *A LOT* to upgrade to professional. There's no middle ground. I think they've massively failed to understand their market. [OP] I was looking for the best alternative to Wunderlist. I think I found that in Todoist. In fact Todoist has some features I like ever better.",
"Absolutely love this app, I've been so organised since using this for the last 6 months. A feature I would love to see in future would be to have 'Tomorrow' as a default view. I primarily use 'Today' as it sorts my tasks into the projects I have set up and it's frustrating only being able to use upcoming to view my next day which mashes my tasks together.",
This app is really helpful to track all of tasks you have to get done. It has tons of different features to organize and remind you of you have to get done It has tremendously helped me manage my assignments in college.,
By far the best free management app. on parr with Familywall. Their website seems legit so I don't think my data is being siphoned to China. You do have to login but you can connect it to your Gmail so there is some security theater. I'm extremely skeptical when it comes to free apps but good job Todoist.,
"Todoist offers a number of useful features, so the concept is good. Widespread availability on platforms is also wonderful. Managing subtasks or mass edits can be a little annoying.",
"A very great app. However, just two things, and they are quite important. Tasks that are completed will not be shown if i dont choose to, and its very annoying tbh. The other thing is that i cant track down the completed tasks by searching the tags but only those incompleted, so what is the point of adding them tags into those tasks, bruh... Hence only three stars. And i noticed that there are so many cmts here complaining about the first thing i complained about.",
"Really good app, but not working correctly with Google Assistant is a real hindrance. I will rate it higher when that is fixed. Not just me, but multiple people saying they can't get it to work either.",
Really wish there was a way to make the alerts a little more consistent and powerful. Seems like they always get subdued. I've tried messing with the setting in-phone. Am I missing something? Android user.,
"I use it implement a semy understood GTD method. The app is quite flexible, and I thing that quite a few different methods could be implemented using it. It has tags, due dates, different levels of priority, and projects. All customizable. And then you could set yor own custom rules, ie filters, that let you create your own ""views"" of your tasks, giving you a lot of flexibility. This enables you to make different logical connections beetween the tasks at the same time.",
"Updating for 2020-still the most important app I use. It's been life-changing. ---- Todoist is the most important app I use. It's a tremendous way to keep track of professional and personal projects and tasks, make lists (weekly menu, shopping lists), collaborate at work, and keep track of my kids' responsibilities. Doist is an ethical, bootstrapped company with a customer-centric vision and a regular release schedule. If I could marry Todoist, you know I would.",
"I use this app everyday for years and really like it, but nowadays it is full of bugs, even simple things cannot be done without bugs. In the last couple of months the app has become noticeably worse due to bugs.",
"While I've only been using Todoist for less than a week I can honestly, with no exaggeration say that it is changing my working life. I am a teacher and organisation is key to teaching... I have no organisational skills at all. This app genuinely helps me keep on top of my work and I'm finding I am no longer falling behind on my work, no longer stressed when I drive home and feel so much better and calmer about my job - I can actually enjoy it! Because it is the best! Thank you Todoist!",
"The February 8th release is completely broken. Will not sync. If you try to update a task it will crash. It seems as if there was no testing done on this! And now five days later, still no fix. If you have not upgraded don't.",
So I am a little frustrated that I can't actually give you money. I need the reminders for this app to be worth it for me and I can't upgrade because it won't let me upgrade in the app and when it tells me to go to the website it just force opens the app every time I log in. Not a great way to make profit. I'm going to continue to use it but the lack of reminders makes it less than appealing.,
"One of the best Organizing app. The UI very simple and easy to understand , you can track, note, and also you get a bunch of template for your work flow. 100% Recommend who is looking for a to-do list or Note taking",
"Been Pro user for more than a year. Very nice UI, clean interface, tags, however requires subscription for reminders, which I consider basic functionally. Considering this, there are better free alternatives.",
Super useful app for productivity. Loved it,
"Full options has no buy option just yet ANOTHER subscription endlessly that I can't really afford anyway that'll screw with my bank account someday and I'll have to fight to end and regret overall. Gee thanks... pass on that. I'll go spend my money on a paper planner that won't be an endless list of auto transactions trying to break me. I'm done with this type of thing, seriously. I can't take anymore.",
I used other to-do list apps before but this one is just perfect. I love google calendar integration.,
"Only worth it now if you want to pay. I used to use todoist for everything, work, chores, planning my wedding, all of it. I recently returned to it and found my free account limited to 5 projects. This has completely hamstrung the utility of this app and I will be uninstalling it after years of dedicated use and switching to one of the dozens of free project management alternatives.",
"This app is good. But when i added a widget to the screen, at times it doesnt work properly. I have to go to the app again and add or cancel my finished tasks.",
I use it everyday with the desktop app. it works great to quickly capture tasks before I forget them. The comments and attachments feature available as a paid account is super useful. Customer service is fast to reply to reported bugs and so friendly.,
"This is about as good as apps get. The app is powerful but not overcomplicated. It's beautiful, intuitive, fast, reliable, and customizable. Really don't have anything negative to say! Thanks for a great app, devs!",
"I feel like I've spent my entire adult life looking for a to do system that works the same way my brain does, so it's hard to overstate how relieving it is to have found Todoist. When I hit the limitations of the a free account, subscribing was an absolute no brainer. Please, please, please don't sell this app to a big company to screw up!!",
"I couldn't work out how to use this app and decided to stick to my conventional hand written to do list and I uninstalled this app. However, I still keep getting 'reminders' about things I never even put in myself (they seemed to be there, maybe as examples?, when I first installed the app). I find this really annoying. How can this even happen!",
"Can't use with VPN. I practice Information Security and prefer to use a VPN whenever I can. I use 2 Norton & NordVPN (not of course at the same time). In both usage cases, when my VPN is activated it would say there is no connection. I have even tried different servers. Is there a reason that VPNs are a problem for your service? How is your data management & security? Does your company view people's data? How do you keep others from being to steal others data, because username & passcodes...",
App was fine until last update now I can't edit tasks or figure out how anything works and I had to delete a ton of projects to make room for an invite that was auto rejected and user had to resend. There doesn't even seem to be a built in help feature,
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling.",
Great app even without the premium version. However would be nice if you could see the completed tasks checked off or crossed off you did that day or the last two days or the last 5 days. I think that would really keep you even more organized,
"dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free.",
"It's a good, simple to use app. My only input for improvements would be it's too easy for an item to be deleted and there is no way that I can tell to undo the action or recover the item. Otherwise, it suits my needs well!",
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit.",
"Seems pretty good initially. But i cant get the adding task by voice to work anymore. Google Assist keeps taking me to other apps instead of Todoist. It keeps adding items to some kind of internal shopping list. Update - I contacted support. They sent email with instructions on linking Todoist to GA. Works but too many questions now. Like others reviewers,, I just want to say. ""OKG... Add task to go to store"" and be done, or ""Ok,Anything else?""... ""no"". Too much dialog now. Used to work this way?",
I was very pleased with Todoist app for quite some time (I am paid /premium member) but since last 2-3 days ago the app stopped working correctly : push notifications stopped working and I am not getting push notification reminders on my android phone anymore. Please fix this bug as this is the only reason I need app at all. Thanks üôè,
I used to have a separate to-do list and scheduled items into my calendar manually. This app has streamlined that wonderfully. The integration with Google calendar and Gmail is seamless and so useful. Fantastic little app!,
Useful once you get your head around how it works. The way it's set up when you first get the app is confusing to understand. It would be better to have a blank canvas and be guided from there. However once you figure it all out it's very useful.,
"This app would be better if it gave you the ability to repeat tasks. Most of my tasks need to be completed monthly, but it doesn't have the option to make a task repeat. I don't want to waste my time having to schedule the same task for every single month.",
"My husband set it up so we can tell Google to add to our shopping list, as a project. It's great in the kitchen, though a little inconvenient to add through all the taps on the phone.",
"I am coming from Wunderlist and I am slowly adjusting to this app. There are several things on that app that are not on Todoist. I wish I could copy repeated tasks to the next week instead of having to retype it. I also would like to be able to see my finished tasks for the week. Completed tasks disappear and are not in the completed tasks (unless it is a sub task). I forget whether I did things or not, hence the reason I need an app like this!",
"Great tool. Easy to use so that you don't give up using it out of frustration. Just naturally type to add a task. Super cool. Don't need any of the premium features, so I enjoy what they offer for free.",

Sugest√£o, criar um ""Todoist premium"" com essas features liberadas apenas para o usu√°rio (sem o modelo de assinatura), eu pagaria por isso! ------ It is excellent! The only thing, however, is that the reminder is only released with subscription. Suggestion, create a ""Todoist premium"" with some features released only to a single user (without the subscription model), I would pay for it!",
"Very nice app with a lot of integrations which makes it very comfortable to use. Although I think some features are missing, e g. Grouping by project in a filtered view",
I like todoist a lot. I would love to see one feature to track my productivity better: To be able to start a pomodoro for any particular task. This way I can track the amount of time I spend on each task and can improve my planning as a whole.,
"Very handy app! :) When you are on the go and have random moments of reminder of your to-do lists, its very handy to just go on this app on your phone and start listing take, reminders, goals. Try it and you'll love it!",
"Well designed app, just wish it had some more flexibility for assigning dates and responsibilities. I also haven't been very successful at using the notification function.",
Easy to use and helps to track my list of things to do each day. I like that I can rearrange items to future days and prioritize them. Would be nice to be able to review past items but it is okay since it's a free app.,
I love the fact that I can integrate my work and personal todolist through this app. I have a work phone that doesn't allow calendar integration with Google calendar. Todoist wonderfully combines my todolist from work and home and plots it on my calendar for work as well as my Google calendar making life much organized.,
"Easy to use and really helps me with executive dysfunction and memory issues from ADHD. I do wish it would give me reminders more than once a day, but I suspect there's a setting for that and I just haven't found it yet.",
"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2.",
"Really like this app, using the free app. Easy to organise, you can set time and dates for when projects need to be completed. In a project you can add a sub project and sub task too. Very handy. You can share your whole project with someone and even tag them in a specific task should you be splitting a project up. The tabs for today and tomorrow are also very uselful as it is a quick reminder to what needs to be completed on those days. You can even set priorities to tasks on urgency. Great app",
"This üëè app üëè is üëè amazing! Very clean design, cross platform stuff sync is extremely quick - checking off someone on my phone instantly checks it off on my Mac. Dark Mode is also present for the free version!!!!!!",
"I've only been using this app for a few days, but am already noticing how helpful it is. I was endlessly writing lists on scrapes of paper and getting in a mess. This is really helping streamline my workflow.",
"New problem The App is not working at all right now, keeps loading and show nothing.. Old problem The changes made on PC are not showing in the phone app... But if i add something in the phone i can see it in the PC... What is going on? Fix this please (I contact support by website, still not fixed) ( at todays date July 2, i just check and there is no updates available for my device)",
"Great themes, simple UI, and has so many features out of the box! Most todo apps only give you access to a couple of projects or a few tasks before they pay wall you. This app is amazing I would recommend to anyone",
"After the last update ""view all"" display changed from by project to by due date and messed up my entire view. No option to change it back..... Im done with this app, they keep changing things everytime it updates and the changes are annoyances not improvements.",
"How did the rating get so high when even reminders need to pay a premium? If it was good then I would'nt mind doing a free trial, but I was out the moment there is not even reminder, so basic of to-do lists, in free version. Just doesnt make sense.",
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!,
"This app has the potential to change your life for the better. Tasks become much less stressing once you note them down, and feels rewarding to tick them off. The user interface is extremely well thought-out. I simply love it and want to thank the people involved.",
"By far my favorite productivity app. Very well thought-out, but also intuitive to use. Great job guys. The only enhancement I can suggest is adding the capability to measure streaks for the reccuring tasks.",
"Newest update nerfs the widget so you can't utilize as much functionality to it. The main app also features the annoying swipe to select feature now. The previous click to select was fine and this new change doesn't add anything, only creates a new barrier of frustration.",
"Free version so far and it helps me stay organized with the Getting Things Done approach. Reminders, Labels and File Attachments are a Premium feature though. Might actually upgrade, it's that good!",
"Exactly what I've been looking for to manage my personal projects and to do lists. After trying out the free version, I upgraded to paid immediately. It's just the right price with easy-to-use features on mobile and web versions. Not sure how managing team software projects would work on it--we're satisfied with Jira and Rally for those.",
This app revolutionized how I keep track of daily tasks and HW assignments. I can even set reminders to look at certain Email in certain days. This app helped me to go from being an average C-/ D student to an A/ A+ student. This app really helps me to prioritize what assignments need to be done first and it helps me organize what assignments go into what class. Excellent job on the App,
"I use this at home, at work, and on my phone. I have created templates and checklists that have already been useful. I work in healthcare, and I'm keeping up with changing insurance requirements better than ever! It works beautifully with the GTD method.",
"I dislike that I must pay to use comments, and I dislike that there is no way to add a description to the task. I understand that in regards to the former that you need to make money, but the latter issue makes it clunky if one has a long and complicated task with resources one must past links to in. But I do appreciate the app and am impressed with how consistently you stay on top of squashing bugs. Keep it up! Can't wait to see kanban implemented!",
Couldn't live without it. On all platforms always at hand. Simple enough to be intuitive. Advanced enough to offer all I need (I have Premium). Google calendar 2way sync stellar! Absolutely love Todoist.,
Very customizable and powerful with filters. Missing start date and some planning ability due to this. Awesome that it is on every platform I need due to web interface that is excellent.,
I love Todoist but it frustrates me that tapping a project in the sidebar doesn't show me all of the sub-projects and tasks like it does on the desktop app. Would save me a lot of time navigating the app.,
"Useful for someone with ADHD who needs a way of making prioritized lists but has a hard time remembering where said list is, what else I need to do, etc. Great shortcuts built in to set up future lists and prioritize those as well.",
"No way to use without login. I'm tired of all my apps trying to tie in with everything else. Just let me have a no-login option with the data residing purely on my phone. Had this installed for roughly 30 seconds, so I can't comment on the functionality.",
"Reminders are a ""premium feature"" apparently. Pretty much renders it useless for me, and $3/month is a lot to pay for something that is free elsewhere. Shame, it's a nice app, but only lasted 5 minutes for this reason. 2* given as it's at least easy to delete your account.",
"This is a loser. Upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial, no option in the app to return to free option. And I'm maxed out on tasks ON the premium. Will delete before I pay for premium. Prior review: Migrated from Wunderlist seamlessly. Much more cumbersome compared to Wunderlist.",
Honestly I've tried tons of apps to aid in productivity. This is the one I always come back to. Intuitive and able to view my list from all sorts of devices are great.,
"Amazing productivity app. But u 've to purchase the premium version to get reminders features, other then that. Really good, simple, fast, gets the job done. By being not in my face with reminders all time.",
"Moved here from Wunderlist, after trying other apps. This is so clean and easy to use and does everything I needed and more. My fiance and I can now both keep track of the grocery list! (So glad it has the ability to share with others)",
"of all the task apps I've tried over the years, Todoist has been the most reliable, fastest, useful. it is my only task tracker for personal and business. the Todoist team is responsive and constantly improving the app.",
"I LOVE TODOIST SOOO MUCH! I swear to God, I'm on top of everything and passing all my classes only thanks to it. I highly recommend this app if you're a student and need to plan your assignments and stuff. Setting reminders sadly does require premium, but I recommend it because it unlocks so many other benefits (larger file uploads, increased project limit, etc). Other cool things this app has is a Wear OS companion app that's actually useful (*cough Any Do cough*) and a karma system!",
"Today I was working with my tasks, writing a comment to one of them. I wrote about an hour, my thoughts, feelings, it was a list of 10+ different items. But after another cup of coffee I accidentally pressed Esc on my keyboard - this closed popup with the task and its comment. I didn't save it.. I thought all my writing got lost.. But thanks to all Todoist team - I reopened the task and comment was there, safe and sound. Thank you very much!! The BEST APP EVER!!!",
"Overall it met my expectation but do hit a bug. When I try to sort with labels, the app will crash. Cannot reopen until I use the chrome extension in my desktop to remove the sort before it opens again.",
"Don't waste your money! Instead, to get a free trial you have to select business even if you aren't a business. Then you can still experience the miserable support experience of 6 days of radio silence (and it has now been 48 Hours of radio silence on my urgent ticket). The app/system/api is fairly good, but I would expect better bug support if they claim to have a business or even premium plan.",
"Overall, very good app. But the latest update made one thing almost impossible - moving a task from project to project. I can't find a way to do that neither from task list nor from task details view. It makes my workflow almost unusable :(",
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day.",
"Looks good, but is for me worthless without notifications. And then 3-4 $ per month in order to activate notifications is way too much. Maybe 1 $ could have been worth in order to move away from Microsoft's free TODO app.",
"Doesn't allow multiple calendars to be synced, making it useless if you're someone that wants to use this for work and personal. Also no proper calendar view. Anydo does both of these things.",
It's good. Reliable and fast sync across platforms. Slightly annoying they got rid of the project drop down on quick task entry as using the # button is annoying on a mac. But will let it slide as rest of app is so good.,
Loved this app until the pop up to install the widget started appearing all the time! I can't get rid of it and it's destroying my experience. I can't make a list without it appearing 2-3 times,
"I love this app so much. It offers a lot of features yet the file size of this app is minimal. The only problem I have with this app is when I try to edit my account name, it only concatenates my input from my previous name, and I just see white background in input and also without blinking text cursor. Please fix this and I'll rate it 5 stars for sure.",
"Some pieces are a bit less than intuitive, some scheduling features are better on the desktop app, and a buy forever option would be really cool. Otherwise no complaints.",
"*EDIT seems to be more stable now, thanks! Been working great but now a bit unstable, crashes after adding tasks from quick access. Crashes randomly in the app. Good phone so I don't believe its that. Cleared cache too.",
the best app I've found for implementing David Allen's system for Getting Things Done!,
"This is my all time favorite calendar app. The amount of customizability along wih the smoothness of the app is great. I use this for mainly for school work, as well as other random reminders and it really helps.",
"Great app. I have the premium app for more than 1 year. But there is a bug that hasn't changed. If you click the share button to social media and immediately cancel it, you are going still to get the rewards",
The best thing about this app is that it lets plan your your to do list not only for present but also for future. And the way it show the weekly calendar in its upcoming is just amazing. And it also sort the task according to priority and time assigned.,
It's a great app ive been using for a while! but only 4 stars cuz I'm not loving the new update with the assignee feature. I don't like that there are question marks all over the place just because I can't assign tasks in my private projects :(,
"I switched from Microsoft ToDo because it had problems with app-website sync. I like this app design, description field on todo item, sub-items design and it worked well so far (while I was migrating manually my tasks from previous app).",
"Awesome! i wish u add a "" Push a day forward/ backward"" option for tasks with date , like when i have and emergency and i can't do my tasks instead of rescheduling, i want to push the whole week a day or 2 with the same days order , or when i finish my tasks earlier than expected i want to bring the whole calendar a day or 2 earlier instead of doing this manually.",
Pretty good. I use it as daily reflection to the task I have accomplish for the day.,
"this app helps me a lot! I can't even describe what I'm feeling right now :"") just wanna say thank you very much for creating this app! well this app deserves more than 5 stars tho LOL I can download it on my laptop also and it will sync by itself if u use the same account! but I have one suggestion for making kind of daily/weekly schedule with no fee, that would be really great! :D thanks a million!",
"I REALLY Hate that every time I reach my goal the app pops up and asks if I want to share it. No I don't and no one cares if I accomplished my tasks it is over sharing. I do like having a shared family chore list. Overall the app is good I get frustrated by the forced social/share aspect I am slightly annoyed by ""game-ifcation"" but I can avoid that by staying in perpetual vacation mode.",
Honestly it's so great and for free too. never felt so productive. wished they made reminds free but the scalability makes up for it. either on my phone or chrome or desktop I'm always see what I need to have done!,
Wonderful native app of an excellent service. I am very glad that added dark mode. Would've preferred of there was some options to adjust the gesture but it's manageable and easy to use.,
"hands down best task management app. easy to use platform, intuitive motions, lightweight on flashy heavyweight on functionality. the karma incentive really surprised me how effectively it helps me want to stay on track.",
"This app is perfect! Simple to use and full featured. Let's you organize your ToDo's tasks into Projects, Subjects within the Project, and even sub-tasks within the tasks. Fantastic tool for logical thinkers. If you are a random thinker like my wife, she just lumps everything in one list, then uses labels to sort things out. Love that it also does Kanban board too.",
"Update: The issue was fixed within a few days. Thank you for quickly addressing the problem. Please fix the bug in the app. As of 4/8/22, it has been crashing on both my phone and tablet.",
Really enjoy this app! If you like making to do lists this is simply perfect for you. I'm on the standard one and it's v good. I'm toying with paying for the premium features so everything is integrated with my calendar and I can have reminders which I think I'll love,
"I have tried and used so many task management apps over the years but I am now happy I have found the best. As long as it continues to perform and does not get bought out by Microsoft or someone else who ruins it, I will not be changing!",
"The UI looks great. Love the dark theme. Problem is I downloaded this app because it was advertising watch compatibility in the pictures but the app is nowhere to be found on my Galaxy Watch Active, which was the only reason I chose this specific app.",
"The app is great but can be very limited. Having to pay monthly just to get certain features. You can't set reminders unless u pay. Only 5 projects are allowed, no labels unless u pay. Still pretty good tho",
Literally everything that i ever need in a todolist app... the minimalistic design and AMAZING user interface is soo user-friendly and helpful to stay organised and plan my days accordingly. Honestly this has been nothing short of a life changer for me.,
"Without a doubt the best app for creating to-do lists and get things accomplished. From work to personal life, this app has allowed for seamless task creation, completion and reminders. You can even tie into your outlook and gmail, use to create simple follow up process. Thanks ToDoist, you guys rock!",
Having a free ToDo App without a reminder functionality is as good as having a stopwatch app that doesn't count. What's the point if it's gatelocked behind a premium? Might as well have released the app as paid. This is considering other apps have this for free,
"It's fairly useful! Been using it for a month, it's easy to reschedule tasks and the emails help remind me of things I had planned. I can also jot down spur of the moment things that arise.",
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.,
"Almost uninstalled this apps since there's shortcomings like no comments & tags features for the free version, but then suddenly it's available for the free version, thankyou! this is very useful for to-do list apps I can't describe it enough.",
"I have used the premium version of this task manager for several years. Cross-platform functionality is a must and it integrates well with several other programs (email, calendar, IFTTT). Great for those using GTD methodology. Try the free (limited) version, then upgrade for full capabilities.",
"This is a wonderful app, I love the simplicity and intuitiveness - it helps me reduce stress from the many things I need to do and instead allows me to focus and get more things done overall!",
"I have been looking for an app that mimics my paper journal. This is it! I am still learning but this is great. I can do everything in the app that I do I'm my journal and then some. I don't have to look for pens and stickers or washi tape. I can decorate in this app with just a few clicks. I would defenatly recommend this to anyone who wants a journal, to do list and more with just one app.",
"Nice app for daily todo tasks. Like the way we can organize projects, tasks, priority and label. Remainder in free version would have great but no complains as it does the todo task management way better than other apps. Kudos to the team!",
"Using it since years to manage both personal and professional space. Happy with it but can be improved. Overall, the best app in the market for managing tasks and much more. Cheers.",
"Very easy to use, and very flexible for however you use todoist. I fully recommend it, I now use todoist to organise all sorts of things. I particularly appreciate having task reminders as notifications.",
"I use the free version and it does enough for me to keep using it. The premium features don't seem aggressively sold, but they do sit there taunting you and they do seem useful.",
To do lists with reminders is all it does‚Ä¶ But it works flawlessly and integrates with desktop app in real time. Definitely the best to do list out there‚Ä¶ Because I've tried a ton of them.,
loving a super simple to do list on my phone screen. widget is simple to add to and check off completed tasks. I've been using the free version for a couple of weeks and have eliminated the scraps of paper in my pockets,
Love the app. Easy to add tasks and nice simple display across my phone and lappie. The desktop app took a hotkey though which I often use in another app and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it to another one.,
"Hard to find option to create recurring tasks, without those it's a no go, paid notifications/reminder. Google calendar offer those for free with pc and mobile interfaces Still recurring tasks are hard to find, additionally I would need to have recurring tasks that expire after X occurrences",
Haven't used it for very long but I like the format. I've created several projects in order to organize thoughts/ideas and future tasks. Nice to have an easy way to dump out the brain every now and then.,
"Great ux/ui, super easy to put a new task, and get your day organized. Another cool thing is that you can connect all your devices and also integrate your Google calendar. Also love the little hiden shortcuts in the web version. Keep up the good work and if you need more feedback would be happy to share üòâ",
The only reason it is not a 5 star is because of some little discomforts. When a list is sorted I think the writing custom sorted is unnecessary or could be done in a mor3 appealing way. And it is my earnest request you guys make a calendar app or have an in build calendar in todoist. I want to plan stuff here and manage my tasks as well.,
Excellent app to keep my tasks in check. Only gripe is that the widget doesn't use the dark theme when I toggle dark theme system wide leaving this one single widget in light mode. Hope it gets fixed soon.,
It's a great app. Easy to use and load to-do list. Only challenge is you might miss the the notification. If they can just add sound to notifications. Otherwise I am enjoying the app,
"So far, so good! I am just learning and have adhd; it seems user-friendly enough to benefit from immediately, while offering more complex options when I'm ready. I'm looking forward to getting better at using it.",
This app needs a calendar view. Bonus points if you could incorporate a merge option with my google calendar. I'm a visual person so a straight up list doesnt do much for me.,
"i am a total chaotic mess and although pretty reluctant at first, this app changed my life!! its easy, friendly, helpful, quick, intuitive and teaches me to organise my life and my projects! thanks to all at todoist!",
"Migrated from Wunderlist and although it's still early days, it seems like a good alternative, although some key features are available only for the premium version. I might give that a go and report back.",
"Does great. Though I wish they added more features like having a brain dump specific list where you can store ideas for the future. You can do this in projects but I didn't want to mix that in with projects that already have an identity. Otherwise, does exactly as it should.",
Great app for sharing lists and keeping organized. Need improvement on deleting projects when done while using app. So far I have had to log in on the computer and delete there. That's annoying.,
"I organize all my life with it. I particularly love the keywords to set the priority, the categorie and the due date of each task. Love the ""slide"" feature to easily check or postpone a task. This is the best tasks organizer on Android.",
"Love the app, but I'm running into an issue where I try to show completed tasks in a project and it says there aren't any. This issue is fixed by going onto desktop and doing the same thing, but I'd like to see it fixed in the app.",
"The app was looking awesome until.....One of the most important parts of this app for me is ""reminders"". After installing the app, it was a bummer to discover ""reminders"" are only available in the paid version. Bait & Switch.",
"What I really liked (and what prompted this review) is how good the natural language support is - I can easily type 'stop Netflix subscription 28 days from now' and Todoist sets it as a task for 28 days later, without me having to figure out these small, time-consuming, decision-intensive details myself.",
"Have been using this app for over a year now and use it for pretty much everything. I use it to manage things for my students, my research at uni, general life commitments, work at uni. The education discount is amazing for the premium version!",
Amazing app. It's good to have something to keep me productive. As bad as it saunds me being lazy it helps me to keep on top of everything I'm planning out to do. I recommend to give it a shot since for chaotic people like myself it can do wanders just if you are willing to make first effort to work on your goals. Its just first week for me so don't want to prize it to much but I feel that difference already.,
Love this app. I was addicted to another to do app and it was very difficult to make the switch. The final push was Todoist's excellent 2 way sync with Google calendar. This has made me significanly more productive from day one with this app. Love it!!,
Todoist has 1 big flaw that really prevents me to use it well: if you schedule a task to be repeated daily and do it few minutes after midnight it will skip a day. Overdue tasks that are completed should add the repeat time to the previous date not be reset to the day they are marked compete!!,
"The best to-do app imo. Free version is more than enough for most users, sort tasks by date, priority or projects, get reminders, overall great. Super easy to sync tasks between devices.",
"This app is what has kept me sane and successful through college and grad school. It's annoying how it shows features that are only available in Premium, but the free version has everything you could need",
"easy to use and organise to do list in a variety of categories. it allows for parent and child categories, support priority assigment (1-4) my only qualm is that sometimes i work past midnight and if i check off daily goals of the previous day, they do not reload into the current. if there is a setting that allows checking off tasks retroactively, or one that locks daily tasks to their specific day it would be helpful and 5-stars",
"I wish widget would have a very compact design, just a list of tasks, nothing more -- no menu bar, no headers, etc. As for me, the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised.",
"It does what I need when I need it and it provides me with in information I require to be more efficient. Plus it is linked to Alexa so it it easy to add tasks or even groceries to my lust. It's a win, win!",
"it was easy to use the first few days, but now it's only adding everyday things (like feeding my dogs) to my list every other day, and not letting me fix it. it also doesn't send notifications so in order to remember my todo list I have to remember to open an app with my todo list.",
"PROBLEM WITH NEW UPDATE. Since the latest update, the app keeps crashing everytime I try to expand a task's subtasks using the built in ""down arrow"" button on the right side of the screen. PLEASE FIX.",
"The app is super buggy for Android. Can't make new tasks (the ""arrow/send"" button doesn't work) & existing tasks cannot be changed either. In summary, the Android app is completely unusable right now for me.",
"Overall this is an amazing app. I have a suggestion though, google calendar has two types of notifications. Default notification, default notification for full day event. Todoist is currently only taking default notification in account when google calendar integration is setup. In todoist, an event with only date should be considered as full day event and when syncing full day notification setting should be applied. If an event has date too, default event notification setting should be used.",
Really inconvenient. Sometimes people just want to make a to do list with out a date. This app is not helpful when it deletes what you didn't get done on a certain date. Really inconvenient,
This app is simply amazing. It's so easy to use and you can synchronize it with yohr pc and phone and it just works great. How longer I use the app how more I begin to wonder how it is possible that this app is free. I'm absolutely stunned by the possibilities of this app. 10/10 would definitely recommend this app to everyone!,
"Quick and fairly intuitive to use. Due dates for recurring tasks can be a little finicky. No built in way to review completion stats of recurring tasks, but it can be done using ifttt.",
**Edit** After seeing some wrinkles ironed out I cannot say enough good things about this app. It has helped tremendously to implement the Getting Things Done method. The fee is not outrageous and worth the price. The customer service is also fairly responsive as well!,
5 Star App let down by 1 Star Pricing. For basic users like me it's simply not worth ¬£4 a month subscription to add the Reminders feature I need and a bunch of other features I'll never use. Would happily pay a one-off ¬£4 fee to add reminders.... but went back to Google Tasks which is nearly as good and free.,
"absolutely amazing app, 100% free, and no ads. literally only improvement i want is ability to add reminders for the whole month, 7 days isn't good enough. Otherwise, well done guys!! Perfect",
I made a resolution to set better habits to steward my time and researched some options. I found this through Tim Challies' recommendation from the book Do More Better & productivity worksheet. He also provided some helpful tips to setting up different tasks under projects and categorizing the roles/responsibilities you have in your life (which is ever changing). I really like that I can set certain tasks to repeat daily or weekly and see the next 7 days ahead to plan out my day/week.,
"Todoist is a part of my memory now. As a single parent of two-kids with a full time job I don't know how I survived before. Now I dump everything I need to do on Todoist and don't bother trying to remember: It does the job for me. I have tons of things to do from kid's school related things to the house and health appointments, I keep everything there. I never miss anything. I strongly recommend to anyone with a lot of things to do (who doesn't nowadays:)",
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.,
"4 year full time user says, ""go elsewhere."" The most recent update has destroyed this app. You can only have a maximum of 5 projects or you have to pay for 300. It's unuseuable with such a low number of projects. You're forced into paying if you want to use the app. I've used this service for years and have really become accustomed to it. I'm very disappointed I have to start the process of finding a new app to use.",
ToDoist is awesome. Probably the thing that makes it stand out is it's natural language recognition. But I also love it's simple design yet wide range of customiziability options.,
"Not at all intuitive, on first impression. The brief tutorial suggests that you need to start by adding a project, but I can't see a way to do this. I added a task, but this then disappeared. No idea how this app works or how it is supposed to help with my life. Uninstalled.",
"I love this, I do wish some more features were free, but regardless it's fantastic either way. Would highly recommend it even if you're looking for a free systematic organizer.",
"love it, and I would buy a premium version for one price but im not interested in anymore monthly payment or yearly payments so ill stick with the free version. it's simple and does exactly what I need it to do.",
"Great app for productivity. Simple, great UI, easy to navigate and easy to use. I like it a lot and it helps me get stuff done efficiently without forgetting stuff as a student with a part time job.",
"It is the perfect solution for someone who has all kinds of proje ts on the go and is in need of a way to keep organized! It is fast, easy, and customizable! Very useful!",
"App keeps crashing after trying to complete 1 task. Not happy. I emailed as per app request. Got a reply telling me not to email, don't bother as that's not how to contact them. My app is still crashing. I've cancelled my membership subscription ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
"This app used to be perfect until they started collapsing all the tasks into one notification. This makes it too easy to ignore, severely limiting the usefulness of the app. Edit: No I'm not going to submit a ticket. Do the work yourself or pay me to do it.",
"I want to 4 stars this and say ""because there's still a room for improvement"" but this app is the best out of all the todo apps I downloaded. I became more organize in my works and it's super rewarding because I can see the task that I completed, it's motivating me to do more works and click more in this app lol. Thank youu, this is so much better. I still have lots of work, gotta goo!!~",
"it's a good app and easy to use, but when I try to reorder and arrange a list, it goes back to the order it was in before I tried to reorder it. in short, reordering lists doesn't work.",
"I've used many apps for to-do lists and for now this is the best of them. I would love to use it also as some sort of calendar- not only for tasks but also for events (things I won't have to check off). I'm not sure if this is a to-do list app, but maybe other users would love this feature too^^.",
"An AMAZING productivity app that simplifies my running of multiple orgs. I no longer have to remind people, follow up to know if things got done, worry that they didn't get the word, etc. Very easy & user friendly. New users don't need training...maybe like 2 minutes.",
"What's a pity. Heaving ADHD I really need an app like this as I need to be reminded daily, every day, if my listening of things to do. With great expectations I signed up and installed the android app. BOOM, I make a to do list and want to set a reminder but, you need to pay for a subscription to get audio notifications. I live in Africa, unemployed and living of so little money it will scare people in first world countries.",
"I went through all the stuff to link this to my Google Assistant, but it doesn't work right. I can get it to add a task, supposedly, but when I tell it to read my tasks it says I have no tasks for today and doesn't give me any way to list the complete set of tasks, the ones I just added. This is worthless.",
"Great at identifying. tracking, and completing tasks. Not perfect, but better than the alternatives I have tried. and continually improved.",
"Pros : no annoying adds, sync across all devices, enough projects in free version. Cons: inerface logic is not common - you have to get used to it, especially for lists, price - 3‚Ç¨ month.",
"Todoist is my go-to task mgt app. It complements my physical planner nicely and enables me to execute well on a daily basis. Great UI, stays sync'd across devices, and dead simple with all the right features.",
"I was facing a problem that my reminder never pop out at notification bar when it's time. I have send a few message to support team regarding this problem. But no one reply, just a member who call David, he sent me a welcome message. Then I replied him with my problem as well. He did not reply too. I have just paid for 1 year package, now I hope I can get my refund.",
"I like this app and this app is very usefull for me but when i purchased premium package for one year , and try to use reminder service that is not working properly ...i tried youtube to resolve my problem but my reminders not give me notification.... Then i sent an email to todoist team and they give me tickect no 408257, but still there is no response from todoist ... So please resolve my problem. I want to use this app and doesnt want to switch to other. app is good for me so i give you 5 star",
Wish you could set reminders for upcoming tasks instead of only seeing the task appear on its due date,
"Simple, intuitive, feature rich. Even the free version is more than enough for my personal needs. Collaboration will need extra feature in the paid version.",
free version was awesome until it wouldn't let me delete my tasks I no longer wanted & forced me to click finished on tasks I didn't finish. all because they wouldn't delete. I get email notifications too telling me I have unfinished tasks which is great & all but it's annoying when it's for tasks I tried to delete.,
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality.",
"I'm a person who loves a paper checklist, but my list is so long that the paper was becoming unruly. I love Todoist and how I can track all my to-dos in one place. I even have a ""waiting for"" list which allows me to follow-up on things I have delegated or requested. When I ""need"" paper, I just print my list. I like how I can search my lists and add snips and comments; I dont have to search through email. Highly recommend!",
"Crashing frequently when interacting with ""boards"" or items that were recently moved. Other than that I think the app is pretty well put together.",
"Great App. Well organized and User friendly UI. Although, monthly subscription is a bit much, I'd rather pay full price for the whole app and get all the features it offers.",
"I really like that you get notified after a few days if you forget to complete something, both on your email and phone. Although I haven't tried other to-do list apps, this one works great so far and I definitely recommend it :)",
"Do you love spam email and push notifications on an app that harvests your data? Try this!! You'll get multiple emails and notifications daily. Go ahead and type in ""buy ___ ' and see what happens to your adds. Took this spyware, malware, piece of junk ""list app"" off my device",
I have enjoyed using the app. I like that you can plan to do something and it's tossed into the void or tossed into a bucket for planning later I wish I could hide buttons related to premium features but once you get used to what is what you can avoid them,
Best app I have ever downloaded and well worth the $36 for premium. Every aspect of my life is organized now and there is no more stress... no more constant feeling that I'm forgetting something... amazing tutorial and super easy to use! Thank you to those that have contributed to the development of this wonderful app!!!!,
"Guys, please make it harder to accidentally 'finish' tasks cause it's getting really annoying. Anyway, amazing app, have been using it for a long time and I feel like it's impact on my life has been immense.",
"I think its a great app, although I do have one suggestion. After completing a task, especially for the day, maybe it would be more motivating to cross it out and keep it there, so that one could see how many tasks they have completed till then and how much they have left.",
"True to its claim! This all-in-one app is definitely a productivity booster (unlike other mainstream productivity apps I've tried.) ;) Easy to use, great interface, very rewarding (esp. when you see your karma level goes up).",
"Cool and descent. Just wish to show completed things automatically. Each time i need to look at them Also while showing completed things, display it as recent first 1. To do 2. Completed recent 3. Past complete .. .. Like wise",
Best task management app and ive tried them all. I keep coming back to Todoist because its flexible enough without being too overwhelming. The app is constantly getting updates and improvements.,
"I have been using Todoist for about 5 years now on Android, iPhone, the iPad, & MacOS. All work well and sync seamlessly. I love the simplicity and the ability to swipe away completed tasks.",
What I'm looking for is scheduling calls. Not just typing call so and so but click on call button and my contacts would pop up to choose from. When you have this I'll gladly pay a fee and will be strong proponent of the app.,
One of the best task managers. I specially like quick add function. But I can't use it because The free version doesn't have reminders and paid is very costly when there are many free options also available.,
"I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend.",
"Great, works with my Google home so I can just blurt out stuff that pops into my head without interrupting what I'm doing. I would like a bit more control over the details and settings in the app itself but that's just me",
"Used to love this app, but the new widget is ugly, unreadable, and too easy to accidentally check something. I'll be looking for a replacement if this hasn't been fixed by the time my subscription runs out.",
"great little app. not too intrusive, very intuitive, and super easy to use. I just wish i was better at following through on my lists so i didnt always have the tray icon reminding me of what I failed to do today!",
"Excellent app. It has got so many things. Looks great visually. Tho the whole monthly payment for a checklist app is too much. 1 dollar = 73 rupess. 4 dollar = 292 rupees a month. , 36 dollars is more than 2000 rupees. Please make the price more friendly. Other than that it's great.",
I love how easy it is to create the task with scheduling due to the way it picks up keywords. I haven't used it as much as I plan to but that I can interact with Todoist through my Google Home is a very appealing idea.,
"Good enough, but is not a replacement for my old character mode MS-Dos program I wrote years ago. What I need is to be able to add attributes to each task and select from a defined list of values for each attribute. I then need to be able to filter and sort by any selection of attributes and values. Labels are not enough for this. I also want to be able to report on the number of outstanding and done tasks by attribute including totalling effort estimates for each. Basically, underpin the app with a relational database and provide an SQL query facility.",
Very nice and useful. This app really helped me declutter my mind and thus become more productive. It has complete features and I think it's just right even without Premium. Truly recommend this app for those in schools and offices...,
Love this app for keeping me organised. Would be 5 stars if there was a calendar on the right side when using the desktop version. So I can choose which project I want to view on the calendar.,
the only reason I had premium was because I could get SMS notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications. beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar.,
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads",
"Looks decent, reminders locked behind a ridiculous pay wall. $48 PER YEAR. Why not a small one off payment? It's a simple app. I'm sure a lot of customers have walked away simply because the price is too high for what it is.",
"Would be a great app if you didn't have to pay for the pro version ($50/year!?) just to be able to get reminders/notifications for to-do items, seems like a very basic feature for a to-do list app to have.",
"The dev responded claiming the sign up process is easy, but **I don't need any of the features that signing up provides**. I do not want backups, or access from other devices. Mandatory sign in instead of these features being optional is why i continue to give this one star.",
"I have never run into problems with this app. it works amazingly. I use this from work school and home. From my desktop to my chrome book for school to my phone for travel, work, etc. best to do list ever!!",
"The mobile version is great, but is there a reason that the web interface is suddenly so slow and unwieldy? It's been a few weeks now, so I'm deleting this app and creating lists on a new app, in case anyone has any recommendations.",
"Really enjoy this app it has literally saved my life. I have a problem with how obsessed i am with to do lists and writing down everything, so this app has been awesome because i can keep it all in one place and even change up when i want to do it, etc.",
It's the best In my opinion. But I feel tasks should not just be overdue. I think introducing an option to indicate that you didn't do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks,
"I crave other ways that I can use my smartphone as a scheduler. this app closely approaches Google Keep which I use daily. There are many indispensable features that aren't used in any other ""productivity"" apps. Check it out, better yet, write a schedule and include experimenting with this app. Bet you find some pretty slick features!",
"Brilliant app! Gets to dos out of your head makes life easier to manage. Only critique is it could work with Google calendar and emails more seamlessly but they are working on that from what I hear. Download it, make it a habit!",
"The only thing that's missing is Scarlett Johansson's voice praising me everytime I complete a task. After hours of research, I realized that Todoist is the best choice for an organisational app. Really, really happy with my choice.",
"love it! Hiwever the with the new update & check boxes I am accidentally pushing & ""completing tasks"" that are not done, which is super frustrating. I also wish I could see all of my different Alexa lists.",
"its been really good and useful. I havrnt figured out how to link it to my google home, but im blaming user error. lol i love the projects feature and the easy switch btw desktop and mobile views and features. really happy with it!!",
"How did I ever get anything done before I found todoist? I use it on every device (the experience is seamless), for everything. Heck, I rely on it so much I just might upgrade and actually PAY for it... which is against my religion (I'm a practicing public librarian). As a planner, lister, former project manager who sees everything as projects, this is pretty close to perfection for me.",
"I've spent lot of time creating great multilevel reccuring subtasks just to find out that I actually see them unorganized in most needful page - today! And in Projects they are organized, but all together, regardless deadline. This is sooooo inconvenient, that makes having subtasks functionality just useless. Why can't you show subtasks under their parents everywhere? REPLY: Sorry, but it's inconsistent logic, as currently you show subtasks, that are NOT due today under task, that is due today.",
"Overwhelming. Too many little features that are too specific and useless to most, while basic things like reminders are only available if you upgrade. (In short: hard to use, and a but of a cash grab)",
"This app is so easy to use! Scheduling, using templates, differentiating projects, organizing ideas, and more is so simple and works just like my brain. Absolutely love it!",
Works well. Would be nice if there was an option for completed tasks to show with a strike through rather than disappearing forever. I like to see what I've achieved.,
have been using it for almost a year now and find it very useful. would like to see a feature where you can add a location to a task so as to make Google calendar and map integration more seamless.,
"I paid for premium on this and it is by far the best todo app I've used. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 stars for me is that it needs an option to set what time your day ends or when the day starts. Because i usually end my day at 2am and by that time tasks become overdue and karma points are not credited for the previous day. Nonetheless, great app üëèüèº",
"Very good app, which is helping me organise and manage my life. Not without its flaws (e.g.crashes and glitches). I have provided constructive feedback to the devs. One star off for penalising non-US purchasers. I resent paying unfairly in pounds what American customers pay in dollars (European customers are ripped off in the same way). The makers claim this is because they have to collect 20% VAT, but this still does not explain why I had to pay ¬£36 when I should have paid about ¬£26 plus the 20% (you do the maths).",
"Does the job perfectly for me! A great set of features with NLP and amazing sync with Google Calendar. No Ads! Love it An update made notifications for tasks as Pro only, A little disappointed since it's an important core feature :/",
I've only used it for 3 days but I have experienced a lot of bugs. Unfortunately their support email is not supported anymore so I have no ways of reporting. New tasks keep disappearing on me and my sections often duplicate for no apparent reasons.,
"Sending a request, setting a password, even attempting to delete my account gives an error. Tried to reset my password, and I got an error message saying the reset code has expired. Even the Chrome extension is useless.",
"Handy app to use for capturing and organising projects and tasks. Took me a little while to find my groove using it but I am finding it really useful when combined with elements of the ""Getting Things Done"" methodology.",
This is a great tool with a minimalist design. One feature I would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget. That would take this to the next level.,
super easy to use. creating and adjusting items is simple. the notifications settings gives lots of options. emails sent to make list items and websites as items are super helpful.,
Incredible app. Don't have words. But I would like to request you about adding a new feature of customisation of timing of when to start the date and also about adding a feature of Sub-section.,
"The app itself is totally fine. I've been using it extensively both for my personal and work GTD-management, the app has a lot of my personal data, activity and thoughts. I'm becoming more and more aware and worried about my digital privacy. Can't be overly careful with these things today. I don't use external authentication in Todoist because I don't want to randomly lose my account after some random ban in Google/FB. But I desperately need 2FA protection in Todoist! We're waiting for too long!",
Used to be amazing but the last day just keeps crashing and app won't open at all. Total disaster as I'm in the middle of a project. Website works fine but is much less user friendly on a mobile. Please fix the app!,
"everything I need to ensure I'm on track for my day, love it.",
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking.",
"it's fine. I dont have pro, but without experiencing it first i won't pay for it. or try a ""free trial"" after putting in my credit card info just to get charged unexpectedly or when i forget. i hate those.",
"Overrides set task order if priority is not at the same level - your selected chronological order will be ignored without any option to disable this. If tasks are completed and restored they go to the end of the list, not the position you chose making this inappropriate for projects that are recurrent like mapping out activities of daily living. 1 star from me + an extra since order may not be important to others (eg. for shopping lists).",
"Love it, hope you guys fix up the widget soon, I'm always having problems with it not switching the veiw to the next day",
"The best todo list app for sure. Been using it from a while, you can feel yourself being productive if you use this app regularly. There is no ads at all. UI is pretty straightforward and easy to use as well.",
Please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window. There are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc. Check how Google Calendar widget shows information in agenda mode.,
"honestly theres something just very satisfying about brain dumping into your inbox, assigning things to your ""Today"" box, and emptying that box every single day. as well as just organizing everything into ""Projects"" that give me an overhead view of everything I feel. its allowed me to focus more on one thing at a time, cause i know everything else is already organized",
"A great app that helps you keep track of tasks so quickly and easily! You can prioritise your tasks and add sub tasks so you can stay organised, I have also connected mine to my alexa for daily morning updates. Using this app really helps me to focus on what I am meant to be doing and how the week ahead is looking.",
I loved it but the recent update changed the reminder settings for pro only which requires a membership. Dissapointed in that change as it was complimentary all this while. Still a good app but not happy with the direction it is approaching. Goodbye Todoist!,
"There are apps with more features and 10000 other things inckuding making coffee for you but this one takes the cake. Simple, no fuss and straight forward functionality. Hit the ground running.",
"Overwhelming! Stop it! First time opening the app and I'm inundated wih a bunch of preorained tasks! This DOES NOT help someone with lack of motivation and a list of tasks already needed to take care of. I'm absolutely INSCENSED that an app could be so blind. Let the user make tasks manageable, instead of telling them what they should do!!",
"It's very helpful although, I would like the task to stay for the whole day instead or just cross it out so I could see what tasks I have accomplished. Overall, it exceeded my expectations. Good job!",
"It worked perfectly on my old Android 7 phone, but works awkwardly on another Android 11 phone with Nova Launcher. The widget keeps loading almost all the time, and the Add button doesn't. It works again if I open the app first.",
"Using it for the past 6 months, maybe less. Simple and clear design, you can track everything you're planning to do, also great widget.",
"I love everything about this app, especially the website which was great guides and blog posts, but a deal breaker for me is that the widget does not sync with your device theme (the app itself does, fortunately). Please change this!",
This app is a simple and easy to use way to make your goals seem effortless. The amount of things I have been able to accomplish as a new manager can be attributed to Todoist. I use it everyday and for everything. Don't bother trying to find a better tool to be efficient with your time.,
"Loved this app. There should be an option of setting different goals for different days of the week, rather than having single daily goal. I think it would be good feature to include. And also you can do that to week and months.",
"Found this very useful in keeping track of my todos, however, there are times where I accidentally check of a task before completing it. Is there a way to check tasks that have been marked off already and undo them? Update: Literally minutes later I found out how to undo them. You just go to your activity log and uncheck that specific task üòÖüòÑ",
"Their response to my original comment tells me whoever is responding doesnt have the app installed, i cant reply so heres another 1 star. I have turned off all emails in general and it doesnt matter. It will email me if i dont make a stretch goal for the day. I add the easy ones, the stuff i have to get done and my stretch goals. It will send an email for each and every missed todo for the day. Doing to much",
"by far the worst app I've ever used. first it didn't work well cuz it didn't save, uncheck boxes, etc ( ive used it for 2 months) then I tried to delete my account and I swear to you they made deleting the account extremely difficult on purpose first theres no way to delete it via the website which forced me to download the app and then the app asks me for my password but I loginned in using google months ago. so you gotta reset your setting and then delete the account. its absolute trash",
"Excellent task minder app. Allows me to create tasks from my email. Able to associate tasks with projects, tag them with labels, set due dates, get reminders in advance of due dates, set recurring tasks, set subtasks, set targets for my productivity, attach important files. A very thorough task minder, with both GUI and shortcut key inputs when creating tasks. I went from the free version to purchasing a subscription very rapidly. If you are keen on minding important tasks, consider this app!",
App is good but definitely not worth going with Pro version. In one year they increased annual subscription amount by 3-fold. I used pro version for last five years. But quit now since the current prices are insane. There are better alternatives at way lower prices.,
Great app for organising & tracking all sorts of work & projects. 5 stars if you could bring back option to create a Comment during the New Task. Adding a task description is good for some things but option to add a Comment at the same would cover all options.,
The app keeps on saying not responding. I can access it on my computer but thru my phone it just shows a black screen. Play give me a solution I have tried everything like clearing app data. Reinstalling etc.,
"Love the app! It's great for forcing me to do all those tiny daily jobs that I would otherwise find ways to avoid. Gone are the days of, ""I'll do it later""; now, the app tells me 'today is the day to clean kitchen hobs or get a haircut and you're going to do it whether you want to or not.",
"I wish it would cross off completed tasks instead of getting rid of them completely. I like the action of getting them crossed off but also having the ability to go back and see what I did that day, which I don't think this app does",
So smooth and versatile. Adjusts to what you want: straight forward if you want just a to-do list yet plenty of options if you want something more detailed.,
"great app. once you learn how to use it, it has all sorts of applications. worka across platforms, and syncs easily, even with other productivity apps.",
"It's a good app. You can even open your to do list on your computer and add tasks and cross them off on your pc, but the only thing wrong with it is that you don't get full access to all the features and you have to pay for some things",
"This app is amazing. I can easily track my personal work, as well as i can track my work for my business purposes. I can list, and mark it done as soon as i finish my work. Even the daily karma level, batch keeps motivating me to do more, to gain the Professional karma level batch. I totally recommend it.",
Moved to this app from any.do because the former app quit syncing with Amazon Alexa. This app syncs quite well with Amazon Alexa so I'm sticking with it. Takes care of both shopping and to do issues that I need. Quite happy so far.,
My boss recommended Todoist for keeping myself on task and organized. It's been so helpful and intuitive I've started using it outside the office. Very user-friendly interface.,
It's really helped me stay on top of the projects that I want to accomplish. I use the free version for a little while and decided it was worth paying for. The integrations are pretty cool too I'm looking forward to see what they roll out in the way of further integrations in the future.,
"Amazing app to manage my time, I don't forget tasks and my grades have improved a lot. All thanks to the amazing scheduling and reminders todoist provides. I will be sure to renew my subscription!",
Excellent app with desktop sync. Really good interface and options of allocating projects and labels etc to all tasks. Perfect to help be a lot more systematic and get on top of all work and home tasks.,
"This app has helped me manage my to do list in a more realistic and efficient way. It looks nice, it's easy to use and packed with simple but useful features. I now use two accounts one personal and one professional.",
it's fantastic! it's changed my whole way of working and reduced my stress levels enormously. Im doing a PhD and juggling several really challenging and unpredictable roles - todoist is helping me stay on top of a really complex range of tasks.,
"Great app but I faced a small annoying issue with the widget. If I check something off on my pc and opened my phone the widget is not updating even if I opened the mobile app, it is only updated inside the app and not in the widget. Until you fix this issue you can add a temporary solution which is a refresh button for the widget as in the app",
Todoist is a great app that executes the fundamentals with precision and excellence. I think this app is so helpful because its singular purpose in task management. I'm very pleased with my decision to go premium with this amazing piece of software!,
"The best GTD app I found so far. Stable, no crazy bugs, the sync is fast and it is awesome that will recognize due dates from written format (like on wednesday or tomorrow). I switched from Todo Cloud and I could not have been happier!",
"This app has everything you need and more. Fantastic widgits that help my efficiency, tons of ways to manage and organise your lists. I downloaded 20+ different list and note apps and this one definitely comes out on top.",
Using the free version. Would like to upgrade but I think $36/year is too expensive for the reminders and comments/files that I'd like access to. I am impressed with their privacy policy.,
"overall enjoy this app as a virtual bullet journal, but i wish I could have items that weren't attached to a date but just sit above or below the weekly view. also an in progress function would be useful.",
"This app helps me keep the grasp of every daily task as well as plan long term projects, and it works as tidy as possible. I couldn't recommend an productivity App more, it's just simple and effective. Thank you, Doist, for this amazing work.",
Beautiful and intuitive interface. Syncs with browser almost instantly. Very impressed with this app and happy that it has helped keep track of things i could have easily forgotten.,
Newest update - items I reschedule for another day keep popping up for today,
I use this to set daily reminders. One of the best apps I've used. Especially since I procrastinate so much. It helps me sort out my work and timings! I really enjoy it and I paid for premium to get the alarms. It's awesome. Thank you todoist!,
"This app is really good. however, I've been experiencing bug (?) lately and the app automatically exits my screen or it just turns white. same thing happens on my pc application.",
It's excellent and it is beneficial for students... The only thing that doesn't go well is the timer... It doesn't go off like an alarm. But this app truly keeps you focused.,
"love love love this app so much!! perfect way to organize my to-do lists and helps me prioritize any tasks I need to complete. ever since getting this app, I've been on top of all my work and have been more productive than ever. don't know what I'd do without this app, highly recommend!!",
"Great Todo app. Core features work as you'd expect. Syncing, sharing lists, adding notes (premium feature), filters. Also has Google home integration (a bit clunky, but works for adding tasks when phone isn't nearby).",
"Very useful integration with Chrome on desktop, sometimes a bit fiddly to set up recurring events using the text method, would rather make specific selections. Overall best task manager i have found.",
"Very good app. There are some features not available unless you upgrade but seriously I don't need those. This is a great, and simple, tool and helps me especially being not that organized a person",
Free version does all I need it to do. Creating tasks is simple an intuitive and even I even add subtasks sometimes. it really helps me to stay on task and keep track of what I have to do day to day.,
"So far the best to-do app I have used. Easy to add tasks and keep track of them, love the calendar features since I don't have to constantly remember to add repetitive tasks.",
"Useful but incredibly clunky application. The rescheduling tries to be very smart, and ends up being completely broken, with rescheduling not being set (on task edit), or tasks being scheduled on the wrong day on completion.",
Everything is well and good and easy to organise. *BUT* Reminder (Previously enabled) SHOULDN'T BE A PREMIUM FEATURE. Please look into it. This is a basic feature across other to-do apps.,
It might be better for other people but what I want is really just a simple to do list and reminder.,
"Todoist is exactly what I needed. Being able to create to-dos on a desktop or laptop browser, then being able to check them off on the mobile app makes things very easy.",
dislike the new update. has screwed the widget up. the individual lines are taking up too much space and its too easy to accidentally hit those checkboxes. then yoy have to go into the app and undo.,
"After almost 1 year of trying to adopt, I have given up. Repeating tasks are nice but not when they end up on the wrong days because they change during set up. App tries to do too many things.",
Will not open keeps crashing,
The best app for organizing.,
It's really good helps me manage my projects and stuff,
I do not like the continued forced reviews!!!! if you want authentic reviews from people give them space and allow them do it in their own time!!!!,
best to-do list app!! it's super clean and easy to use but it still has all the features you'll need. you can do mostly everything you'll need in a to-do list without buying premium which is nice plus no ads.,
I really like the app. But when you will make a nice compact ( yet informative) view for the app and desktop? It will bring app to next level as it will look less overwhelming. At least for me.,
"Hello Doist, this is the best task management app I've ever seen and I wish you the best of luck making this app better for all of us. I have one request for a feature, I would like to use custom colours for my priorities. Thank You very much in advance, from a long-term user.",
"Rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working. Rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear, earlier I have experienced that it duplicated tasks. This way a basic functionality is broken and I just lost what should I follow-up today... No activity log available, as that is a paid feature. I guess I will never try that now.",
"Just wanted a basic notepad to keep track of things to do, instead had to grant access to a bunch of stuff and now it won't stop emailing me. Ended up uninstalling and have to block the emails. Way too intrusive.",
"I'm not a fan of having to use a paper diary to keep my life on track. Todoist has saved me in more ways than one - I can access it from any device unlike ColorNote, and it motivates me with the Karma system. The only gripe? I've only used it for a week and still don't know how to use it effectively.",
designing filters very helpful for sorting and prioritizing while keeping BIG picture. great to have info across platforms. easy to add items on the goal. Well written help guides and usful tutorials on YouTube.,
"Awful. Upgraded to premium and tried to use it. Completely unintuitive, difficult to use and definitely not user friendly. I got so frustrated with it I literally cancelled my subscription right away.",
"Tried every solution on market, can say for sure, it's the best planner for now",
I like using this for personal use and wish I could have more lists instead of just 6.,
"I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane.",
"Convenient, but I suspect it arbitrarily deletes tasks, and the support team isn't helpful. Support ticket 692041. Happened several months ago, and yesterday happened again. I'm now looking for alternatives, as I can't trust Todoist. Now evaluating Google Tasks.",
"Todoist is an amazing task management tool. I can organize my tasks into projects and subprojects, set due dates, and enter recurring tasks. My mind feels so much less cluttered now that I can offload things to Todoist. Highly recommended!!!",
"Loved this app until it started giving me a ""permission denied"" error every time I tried to open it. Deleted, downloaded again and it worked for a day before giving me the same error. I have not had this problem with any other app, so I can only assume the issue is with Todoist.",
"Love this app. I use it to keep track of ongoing, long term projects. But you can use it for day to day task (to do list) management Very easy to learn your way around the app and get started quickly. Highly recommended.",
"Still no way to bulk-clear completed tasks. You're also limited to 5 ""projects"" (Todoist's name for groups of tasks, like ""Groceries"", ""To Do"", etc.) Were you an early adopter that had more projects? Don't delete any of them, they'll be gone forever. This was my go-to note taking app for years. No longer.",
After the update all my completed sub tasks were deleted. I set those up because I uncheck them every month when I need to use the same lists over and over. Really annoying especially since I don't think I'll be using the new features at all.,
"This task/project management app revolutionised my life, brought about a clear judgement for prioritizing and balancing work & personal life. My favourite is the recurring task functionality which is excellent for habit creation but not also building consistency in project management. 4/5 cuz I haven't used the premium version yet.",
this app is so amazing man omg names project management/task management so much easier for me!! was using Any.do before which is good as well but this one is way better since I have multiple projects/task groups going on. Only thing I dislike is that add comments is behind a paywall. I wish you had that in the free version just consider it! any.do has it in free version. 5/5 stars still,
Fantastic experience using todoist. Really impressed with the simplicity and it's helped me manage my responsibilities much better than I ever could have imagined. Getting tasks out of my head and into todoist had changed my life!,
"Brilliant, but need time to learn. I use this in combination with David Allen's Mastering Workflow philosophy. Very helpful. But it takes several days to 'upload' all your priorities and tasks to the app. That is to do with human strategy, not the app. But the app makes it quick and easy to structure.",
Unable to sync with Google calendar on Android. Unable to cancel lost $36 bucks in 30 minutes. Had to get pro to set up feature. The mistake I made was not starting with 1 month. Leave and learn. Refund from these people none existent.,
"I've been using Todoist for years now and it keeps improving, the Latest foundations update has really changed things for me the addition of sections and the task view with subtaks has reduced the sheer volume of projects and sub projects to manage as I can now fit them into a smaller number of better organised projects. The task view is a master stroke as I am able to focus in on a particular task. the only Improvement I'd ask for is the ability to track my time spent on tasks a countdown timer that I can set myself from the task view so I can take breaks at more healthy intervals and timebox tasks as well as giving me data to help me better estimate my future tasks. Keep up the great work guys, your work is a life saver to me",
Really Great app to start organized. I've been using the mobile app in addition to the desktop app and the two have incredible synergy! Todoist was even nice enough to offer a trial of the premium version,
"Was a bad decision to move to ticktick instead of this great app, will move back to todoist soon again.",
"Love the desktop version. Ability to quickly add task using shortcut is my fav, without having to go application window. I wish there was an ability to add comments in free version.",
"Todoist is the best to-do list app I have encountered & I have tried A LOT of them. Reminders? Subtasks? Tags? File attachments? Voice recording? Subprojects? Integrations? They even have templates and a blog that gives productivity tips. 2 months ago I would have suggested they have kanban boards. I was integrating MeisterTask and Todoist through Zapier because of this. But just like that, they introduced the board feature and I immediately deleted MeisterTask, just like that.",
"So far Todoist has worked fine, but the fact they want you to pay a monthly fee to set a ""reminder"" is ridiculous. So many times I'm in the middle of something and can't finish a task right then and I want to be able to set a reminder. Time to move on to another app.",
"Great app!! The only thing that would it make better is color-groups. For example if a few things are about the same subject, you should be able to put them together. Then you get a better overview.",
Receiving way too many emails and reminders on my personal email and as notifications. It's crazy spamming! It's also not easy to organize with. I'd use simpler notes apps to jot down ideas and lists.,
"I think it would be more competitive if one or two of the paid for functions were free but overall it's a solid app. It functions well for how and why I use it. No complaints so far, just good vibes!",
"It's simple and easy to use. I like it very much. I use on my mobile and computer that made me handle my a lot of task. But I want a calendar view function, so I can see clearly my task of all month. Do you have a plan to add it?",
"Very simple, yet has the most thoughtful features. Been using the free version for over a year now and my productivity and peace of mind have both skyrocketed.",
Integration with Google Calendar is second to none. New card (kanban) view is amazing on both my desktop and Android phone. Have tried them all. Keep coming back to Todoist. Just the best.,
Great app. I'd never be able to keep track of all of my work to-do items without it and the projects function makes it super easy to keep my stuff organized and easy to find.,
a paid to do list application with notifications and reminders that don't work... so many times I've forgotten to do things because this app was supposed to remind me and didn't. that's unacceptable. switching to the Free gtasks instead.,
"Cool app, very essential, I could do without the lingering toasts on the bottom that cover all of the actions I might like to take on a selection for a ridiculous amount of time.",
"Really easy to use task manager, ability to schedule posts and get alerts when you're over due, great layout in projects or per week, ability to add links, emails, and subtasks - made my work life a lot easier!",
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.,
light weight enough not to slow you down. Enough features to build a system out off. Any idea or thing that needs doing through the day just gets thrown in here to get it out of my head.,
"Can you fix the bug where when adding a task, the keyboard fills up past the options that lets you select priority and projects? It's not critical but it's annoying to see at a UX level",
"Quite simply, the best. Cannot get over how user-friendly Todoist is--the devs clearly designed with *intention*. Pre-made templates are a godsend, text markup/emoji integration made me smile, and powerful organizational features made me stay. Kudos üôå",
I use todoist every day and dont lose track of routines and/or infrequent but very necessary tasks. it's easy to use snd understand. I've used it on a couple of projects with success.,
"Initial Review after one week: Enjoying the simplicity and ease of access, organization level, and the speed that a project and group can be configured. The only issue I've had is changing indentation or parent/child relationships on tasks. wish more of the app was available to free tiers, but they've gotta make money somehow so i cant blame them.",
"Hey todoist! Why are you todoing this to me!? First you put these silly little checkmarks on my tasks that are 100% in my way (leftys are people too). I keep unintentionally deleting tasks and having to dig through my completed items to restore them. That's annoying! Now this latest update, you've taken away subgroups? Subgroups are part of the entire project. Having an overall view of all subs within a group is convenient. Having to flip from sub to sub is illogical. I just don't get it!",
"I just switched from doit.im, as I wanted something that looked better and felt easier to use. Todoist is pretty great so far. I will say that I think Todoist is for people who like to track details about their tasks. If you just like lists and check boxes. Todoist will probably feel like too much.  The one complaint I have is how they handle project templates. Oddly, the only way to create templates is by exporting an existing project to a csv file, or creating one in a csv file. You then have to manually import the csv file to create a new project. So every time I want to create a ""Prepare to go camping"" project with all the sub-tasks, I have to import a csv. and I don't think it can be done in the mobile app. This should all be handled within the app. You should be able to save any project as a template in the app and then create a new project based on a template in the app; and those templates should be synced across your devices. I really hope they are working on this. Dealing with csv files is clunky and not what I would expect given the quality of the rest of the tool.",
"Developer holds notifications as ransom for a monthly payment. Would be acceptable for a small membership fee, but I have to pay for all of premium just to get notifications, the whole point of a to-do app? No thanks.",
"Great app! It is very organized and can keep all your tasks together. The only con is that you need to pay for reminders. Personally, reminders should be a free feature.",
"Not sure if I did not do the settings right or what, but I never got notifications for this app, I got plenty of useless emails that I only check once a day. I had all permissions and app notifications on. Just not worth it.",
Best to-do.list app ever,
"Great experience with this app. I prefer it to Asana or Monday because not unless you have 100 member project management teams, this tool is simple, detailed, and to the point. You can even assign projects to be shared with certain clients or teams. I make my assistant's list for her and can see when things are complete. The price is right for a young entrepreneur or small business. The trouble is the comment section doesn't let me record my voice in Android or Apple phones. Great app",
"This is the best productivity app. Ever, it has simple and understandable UI, it sync across all platforms, it even integrates with my pomodoro app. I am enjoying it very well and i can endorse it to anyone having trouble make their day.",
"4/3/21 Looks like they don't listen to reviews as reminders are STILL a ""Premium Feature."" Thanks for nothing. 10/25/20 I was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms, but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this. Come on Todoist! Reminders should never be a ""Premium Feature"" in a task management app!!!",
"I love it, intuitive with great features in free version, It's not filled with ads or shady marketing, when it's done this way I might actually want to go premium :) keep up the good work and thank you!",
"Good overall. I'd love to be in able to change which time of the day marks the change between ""Today"" and ""Tomorrow"". I go to sleep past midnight, so it means my todo list shows lots of recurring tasks for ""today"" that are actually meant for tomorrow. It'd be much nicer to be able to go to sleep with an emtpy list.",
"no ads, rewarding task completion, easy interface, lovely organization :D",
"Great app, some annoyances. I don't usually review apps, and am only writing this in the hope that it will stop asking me to rate it after every single action. Having clicked no I don't expect to be asked to write a review again 5 minutes later. Other than that the app works as it should.",
"Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it.",
use it on the daily. simple formatting and can be adjusted - but not too many options that it gets overwhelming. very user friendly and they have great blogposts on their websites.,
"Very useful and handy. The simplicity of managing tasks pops this app out of hundreds. I'm enjoying using it and wheater you're a student or a very busy working-at-aoffice person, I highly recomend it. You won't regret.",
"I have been using it for years now, but the windows version is still not as perfect as Android version. When I open the windows 10 version of todoist, the app load takes too long",
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes t",
"This is an excellent list-based organizational app made even better with (near) seamless integration into Google calendar. ToDoist has replaced all planners/calendars I had, and I'm grateful for that.",
"Love it. Only tweak I'd love to see is when you have something to reschedule and you open the Smart Rescheduler feature, when you click on the item you can customize the suggested date.",
"Great app, helps me achieve my goals. When I neglect to use it my productivity drops. This app really keeps me focused, especially with recurring, easy to overlook, tasks",
One of the few apps i use everyday (and I have been for more than a year now). A true productivity work horse with an elegant and meaningful user interface. Todoist slips right into my daily habits.,
I find this app to be very helpful when it comes to keeping track of everyday things I need to accomplish and one off tasks I need to quickly jot down before i forget. it's easy to use and a great way to start organized!,
"Like many others, the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively. What used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks. It wasn't broken, why did you have to 'fix' it. I'm hoping they roll back some of these changes, if they don't I will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app.",
"""You can do eet!"" EDIT: Often crashes when using version downloaded from the Chromebook Play Store. I prefer to use the Chrome Extension do to its reliability and its hotkeys/shortcuts(?).",
"Really simple and easy to use, could do with a usable month calendar instead of just 7 days. And the option to set an alarm for high priority tasks/reminders",
"If you are looking for a incredible to do list, go no further. Todoist has made great strides since I first started to use their web app. Natural language additions are a nice touch.",
"Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be happy to pay, but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered. At least not for my usage.",
"This is the best To-Do app I have found so far, but it's missing some features I would love to have. Sometimes behaves weirdly, when you operate on lists with hundreds tasks.",
"Have been using this app for quite some time and I loving it. Would love it even more if at least some of the features that are for the Pro version made are made available for free. Please developers, if u r seeing my comment, please make some features like ""adding tags"" and ""adding colors to Texts"" etc available for free. Would be extremely grateful if feature to add colour to Texts is made available. Thanks. Please do it",
"Edit: Developers have fixed the bug and now this is back to my most used app. Definitely recommend it! Original review: Was a great app, suddenly completely stopped working. Will happily change my rating back to 5 stars when the bugs are fixed. Cheers!",
"Best to do list tool. I have 30 things to do every day but this app keeps me in line and I meet my deadlines. Between remote work, homeschooling, running errands and holiday shopping, this is so useful. I even have it on my laptop so to the team who created this...thank you!",
"best task manager ever, with this app, i always get the task done before the due date, it's also easy to manage and reschedule tasks. it's a magical experience altogether.",
"I love the simple, flexible interface, and that it's integrated with so many apps that I use. I just wish it was integrated with OneNote too.",
"I purchased this as a micro project management tool only to discover that it is incredibly restrictive and one of its functions. Its functions are absolutely incredible, but the problem is you can only raise so many tasks within a project? This is not mentioned anywhere in the spec and I would not of purchased it, because that‚Äôs the only way that you find out after you‚Äôve purchased it, if I knew to only allowed 300 tasks within a project is incredibly small. So just a warning this is nothing b",
"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer. It was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option. But now I have to go through my hidden gift stash. Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time.",
"So useful, so great the way it syncs up with my laptop. Best to do list app out there for sure. Wish you could see your past tasks would be my only improvement.",
"It was a great app - until I got locked out of my account one day, for no reason, and lost all my tasks. Update: I reached out to Todoist support and they promptly replied. The issue was fixed the same day. Ok, I'm back on board! :-)",
"Very simple check list application, if you don't pay no teminders, no comments, nothing. Also there's no even taking simple notes stuffs. Just checklist and and sub task. If you want very basic, use it but tick tick ist best one. Sorry guys. It's reality",
"Great app. The best to do list app, hands down üëç üíØ",
"Meh, it's OK. Same as Microsoft To-Do but you have to pay for extra features. Plus, you can't add multiple accounts and have items pull from multiple calendars. I like MTD better.",
"It needs far easier editing of individual tasks for more details, including bulleted lists and other tools. Just having an overview of To-Dos is insufficient in many instances.",
"Just migrated to Tick Tick - it's better with more holistic useful functionality and cheaper with free version having not that much restrictions like in Todoist. Sorry guys, it seems you have some work to do if you want to stay competitive.",
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it.",
Easy to use and keeps me on top of urgent tasks. Have mine set up as a widget and easy to see what I have to do each day. Works really well for the features I use in the free version.,
This app has the same functionalities on all platforms and adapts very well to the device you're using it on. Adding tasks is very easy with the button in the notification menu.,
"When you complete a task it disappears!! Not a good function - means you can't remember what you accomplished, and you don't get the satisfaction of seeing a big list of things crossed out (something list makers love!)",
"Its a good list app. But the reason why i give it a low response is that you have to pay a subscription to be able to use things such as reminders and alarms, which i need to be able to even remember that i have a list of things i need to do on a daily basis. Apart from that solid app.",
"This app is simple and clean. I have ADHD, and I forgot what to do without a to-do list. As a result, I have tried many similar apps. This app is far and above my favorite. It's simple and easy to complete or reschedule tasks. Love it!",
I todoist for time management and productivity. I have used it with small work teams also and the shared folders/shared task features are great. I recommend it to other and love it so much I became an affiliate.,
"As someone who isn't interested in task sharing or syncing, I find it insulting Todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a one-time unlock. That's just greedy.",
Overall the app's great! More like was...before the feature where one can't see the tasks in the subprojects was introduced. I actually prefer it that way. Would have been a 5/5 otherwise.,
Love it! Would like to see an option to keep completed tasks archived in the future so I can look back on when I completed things for work. Edit: Thank you for the response! Loving this all so much. Desktop version is amazing as well.,
"It works, but many of the best features are behind a subscription. I'd consider a one-time purchase, but the app definitely isn't worth what a year's subscription would cost.",
Very very difficult to understand and use this app,
wonderful todo daily goals...and weekly goals of the project work,
Super charging productivity. Best app in 2023 for me,
very useful tool to keep life orgnized,
Single Best Organising App.,
This app works great for me. Its even better after I smoke üëΩüëç,
Why on earth would a to do list app need you to make an account?? There is no reason for that.,
"I have been using it for a very long time. So far, I have not met better alternatives.",
"Use it constantly, love it, always suggesting it to people.",
very useful..thanks to all member who contribute for this app,
"Need a monthly subscription to manage a toto list? Give me a break. Went to add a SINGLE kitten and was told I had to update to pro to get notifications? Well sorry, but that kinda defeats the purpose. Some people have a hard time remembering the tasks which is why they use a list.",
"Really good app w nice interface and easy to learn layout. Lets u divide tasks by ""projects"" which i find really useful! Also gives subtasks, which also helps a lot. Would recommend :)",
"Great app! Todoist will send reminders that I have 0 due for the day. This makes me think twice if I really have nothing to complete for the day which that is not the case! So it makes me add task and by the end of the day, I got some things done!",
"I enjoy it for what its worth, with a nice interface and customisation, but basic features like reminders for tasks are subscription only, which defeats the second bullet point in the app description.",
"I struggle keeping on top of things, tried many different apps, this one is the best by far. a clean to do list, no pandering, just productivity.",
"I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead.",
"I liked the app, it was missing a few things but It was okay. I uninstalled it at one point, until I decided if I wanted to keep it, but I am still getting notified for the reminders. It is incredibly annoying and I can't figure out why... Edit: Thanks for the help, the problem is now that I don't know what account I logged in with.",
One of the best To-do list i have ever used. It has lots of feature which helps to work efficiently and effectively. I'm almost using it for 2 months and i really like it. Thanks You Developers for such amazing app.‚úå,
Has frustrating sync problems. Won't sync unless I have Todoist open on both devices. I've used Todoist for 8 years and it's the first time I've had this problem.,
The best ever todo app i have ever used... Helps me plan my week in advance and get things done. Love the natural language processing and features like projects and labels. Highly recommended to stay on top of your game.,
"This has been the go-to way wyeve managed my family's projects and errands for years ar this point. It's intuitive, works great on every platform we've used, and is really easy to use for both ad-hoc stuff and bigger projects.",
"There is a bug in the app. After i deleted one of the templates i got from the todoist app, it wont open anymore. I set up all daily routines from another app. This is very annoying.",
"Todoist is a great app for organizing your time and to do list. Easy to use and good reminders in email, not on going annoying notices like some apps. Highly recommend to organize your life.",
"Literally life changing app. Such a clean, easy to use interface and a great accompanying blog explaining how to use it well. I recommend it to anyone who will listen.",
"Room for improvement. It would be nice if subtasks could have different statuses in boards, and completing them could automatically complete their parent task. Nonetheless, this app is impressive.",
Best. App. Ever. I love Todoist. I've tried lots of to do list & project management apps but this one comes out on top. A few things I love that you can do: ‚óèCreate general tasks or lump those tasks under a specific project ‚óèFlag tasks by priority level ‚óèAdd date & time deadlines to tasks & how easy it is reschedule/postpone as needed ‚óèBrain dump details on projects I plan to prioritize later or work on as I have time ‚óèSimple integration with Google calendar I'm a Todoist user for life!! ü•∞,
"YOU TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT, Poindexter! No email is necessary to TRY IT OUT FIRST. IF a user decides to keep it, THEN they can create an acct AFTER TRYING IT OUT. READ FIRST before you give a pointless answer! ü§¶üèª Uninstalled as soon as I opened it. YET ANOTHER app that STUPIDLY won't let you try it WITHOUT an acct first to see if it's even going to work for you. ANOTHER BAD FIRST IMPRESSION..... NEXT APP!!!",
"Helpful, allows me to keep track of things very intuitively. I get a lot of ""brain fog"" due to my chronic conditions, and this app helps me stay on top of everything.",
"Have always found this one of the best apps in this category, but since the last update is now continually shutting down the app every time you update or save a task.....very frustrating.",
been using this for years now and it fits the best with how i work. never found a better app. some ideas for improvement - floating tasks (not meant to be completed but occur daily) - feature for making notes that change daily,
it's a great app in general. the Android version just a little less full featured than the web version. i find the interaction with Google's assistant a little buggy.,
"What good is a task app if it can't remind you to do a thing? I understand that the developers need to make ends meet, but reminders not being free is really obnoxious and prevents me from switching to it full-time.",
"Cannot get it to stop asking me to verify the time zone. Pressed yes, kept asking. Pressed don't ask again, kept asking. Pressed no, kept asking. Finally deleted. I'll use the the one that comes with outlook. It's not as versatile but it doesn't ask me to verify my time zone every time I look at it. Especially when I ask it not to ask me again.",
I use the free versions. Works well and syncs wonderfully between my Windows laptop and my Android phone. The Project categories are well used by me and I find the smart date recognition excellent.,
"Theres no other app like todoist in the playstore. Good job. This app was what I was searching for, it has everything that I need expect one little thing. If there was an option to add an alarm for the remainders, that would be great. I hope the developers will add it soon.",
Todoist works well to keep prioritized lists that can be worked through as time permits. Use Alexa to add items to your inbox. Later move them to projects or work them from your inbox. Lots of flexibility.,
Has literally changed my life. I use it for everyday tasks and chores. My husband and I literally no longer argue about what needs to be done around the house. I also use it as a grocery list as well so my husband and I can add things to it and when we go to the grocery store we just swipe of that we got it. Absolutely life changing.,
Does not sync well with the desktop's browser. Completed or new tasks on one do not appear on the other. Todoist is not much use unless I can use both devices.,
"Updates keep making the app worse for power users I can no longer type `3p` to make something due at 3pm when renaming a task. In fact, I cant find a way to assign a time to a task after its been created at all. If i do it the long way (assign time -> choose time on clock -> click ok) the time never gets assigned I can no longer type `p1` to give it first priority when renaming a task I used these features all the time and now it takes me significantly more time to perform these actions",
life changing. boards or something similar to the other to do apps would be good. not tried the project sharing either but that is a great feature i know that works well. widget on oneplus 6 is amazing.,
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.,
Incredibly helpful. My shortterm memory is trash and this app helps me keep track of all my random tasks for work and personal life. Love that it works seamlessly switching between my phone and laptop.,
"Useful, however some parts are not intuitive, for example its easy to think you've set a reminder when you haven't, because you didnt click the final OK.",
"I have tried other ""To Do"" lists before and this is by far the easiest ap I have used. I now combine Todoist with Trello and Evernote. Some projects in my opinion need Todoist plus either Trello or Evernote. Some jobs for today just require Todoist. Whatever I do I always use Todoist first and complement it with the other systems as and when needed",
"New update has caused a lot of issues with the widget. Every time I complete a task, it resets to load my list from the top. I need to scroll down every single time. Please fix.",
"This is the BEST to-do list app. I have tried many over the years and this is the one I have stuck with! It offers everything I need, attractive layout, and always adding new options.",
Todoist has helped me keep my life moveing forwared consistently by helping me organize my goals and acheive them. One thing is I am truly a broke college student and want the pro version functions but csn not afford them. Great app though!,
"Really helpful to track project with simple interface and easy to use. Anyway, it's not a variety of the feature but quite simple.",
App and its functionality are amazing. Really wish there was just a one time fee to unlock all of its features :( As much as I love it.. I just cant do a subscription...,
"After the latest update, tasks get duplicated and deleted at random. EDIT: for whatever reason, it stopped happening, I can't recreate the issue anymore. Soo ^-^",
"Absolutely amazing, it has no clutter and everything you need, excellent widgets to manage your work from the homescreen, it does what it's supposed to do really well.",
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month.",
"I'm only two weeks in and purchased premium and killing it (even more than usual) at work. I love this program! I mostly use it on my desktop but it's great for when I think of things after hours, am on the road with my boss or walking out he office door and someone throws something my way I need to remember.",
"I have been able to stream line my life and really focus on what means the most to me even with the distractions of 8th grade, moving states, and going to a new high school. I love the app!!!",
"I love Todoist and use it all the time! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish I could set reminders for individual tasks without upgrading to premium. That's the only premium feature I really wish I had. Other than that, it's a very useful app!",
Todoist is just what I need to manage my life. A great place to capture tasks as they cross my mind and put them on a schedule. Otherwise they go into the ether and never get done. Like how tasks also show up on my calendar and then on Echo Show.,
This app is very unsafe. They ask you to sign up with your email address and password. The sign up page is very similar to Gmail and may fool people into using their Gmail password. Any app that uses such tactics to capture your email sign in details cannot be trusted. Its is compounded by the fact that they don't ask you to confirm your password on sign up. Immediately uninstalled due to trust issues. Stay away!,
Great for keeping track of your life. Widgets make it easy to see your list at a glance. Just wish it would integrate with my windows calendar and samsung calenders on my phone and pc.,
"This has been great! Helps me quickly as reminders and keep myself organized! I love that the recurrences can be pretty random, for example: ""every 19 days""",
"Does what's supposed to do and does it well, I did like the previous UI more and would like a feature to swap between old and the new one, but it doesn't really matter that much still gets the job done, I'm only more used to the old UI",
"Todoist tracks all my required tasks, ensuring that none slip between the cracks. I would give it 5 stars if it had task dependencies and an easy way to download all completed tasks in one step.",
Generally very good. I have a few problems when I use it for reminders. working out what I need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging.,
Not only does this app help one in getting things done... It helps you as an individual to just get organized and you end up realizing that there is always enough time to do everything... I highly recommend!!,
"great app. very easy to use. even though there is a paid version, i like the free version. The limmits are some thing you can look over and on top of that NO ADDS. just perfect.",
"After I found out Wunderlist was going away I look for an app that could do all the things that could do as it was pretty much perfect for me todoist is pretty much as good, not perfect but for free I can't complain!",
"Used to be an avid user of the app, but now sync occasionally does not work with the Chrome extension. Both are updated to newest version.",
I have been using the app for about a month and let me tell you! It is so delightful to cross out all your tasks and seeing how productive you are throughout the day. It is nice that you can set deadlines and add tasks and subtasks to be completed. I am now contemplating going premium!,
"I downloaded and purchased premium for this app on New Years 4 years ago after being fed up of the slump I was in. Since then my productivity had improved significantly and my mental state immeasurably. This honestly has to be the best value for money purchase I've probably ever made. Highly, highly recommended.",
"Tried it, but have found some smoother apps. The dates (how the dates function) on the task list became way to cumbersome. Need something more like a backlog. A bit pricey.",
my husband and I use this app all the time. keeps us organized and on the same page. allows us to coordinate our grocery list and know what the other one needs! reduced marriage arguements by 25%.,
"Great experience! I love that its available on every platform, great job guys. I hope you'll add the feature to edit task like document (like Notes app of Apple) then it will be perfect üëå",
"I was a Wunderlist user until Micro$oft forced me to another platform. To Do is not the answer. Then I tried Todoist and I find it almost as good as Wunderlist was. A few more keypresses are required, but it is still very well done.",
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars.",
"Good interface, design. Could make it more interesting by using subtasks, a leaderboard, and motivational quotes and option to set constant reminders.",
"Initially it didn't let me view the shopping list synced from Alexa on my Android Smart Watch. However, as the developer says, if it is added to the Favorites, Alexa shopping list gets synced.",
Simply the best best task manager I've ever tried. My productivity multiplied. Thank you devs.,
"Works fine, but not very handy with active usage of one-handed mode gesture",
Simple and straightforward. Is very user friendly and has many ways to support you throughout a day. The only thing that I wish it had was a one off purchase price instead of monthly rates.,
"Add new task button is disappearing every time I start the app. Samsung Galaxy S8. Fix it, please.",
Wants you to pay ¬£4 every month for setting additional reminders. Uninstalled.,
GREAT redesign! Really love being able to swipe up from the bottom! Gone are the days of having to reach with my thumb or using two hands. The change is very simple and easy to get used to.,
Love the app but it has recently developed crashing problem at startup!,
"This app allows me to be more productive as I have deadlines to follow even for the most mundane chores. I love the reminders as they help me complete tasks when I need to on busy days by reminding me to do them in the first place. Keep up the good work, developers of Todoist!",
Simply the best ToDo app I've ever used and I've tried a lot of them! Warm thanks to developers!,
Best app ever to come across It is simple and easy to plan hour by hour daily routine,
Amazing app. Easy to use and it does raise my productivity level.,
Love this app. It helps me organize my day to day schedule so well.,
"Almost perfect, exept for when it sometimes crashes in the middle of editing or doesnt arrange the tasks into subcategorie. I always have the process saved tho. Wonderful and functional otherwise",
Best listing app ever makes my mornings jobs so easy cannot reccomend this highly enough!,
The best app of all time for planning and scheduling tasks üòÄ,
Now reminders aren't working! Your trouble shooting guide did not help.,
"Simple and very easy to use, clean ui!",
App doesn't have any alarm system on scheduled time of task.,
"I have to say it would be hard for me to live without a to-do list. Todoist is a great implementation of that and I just use it for everything. Work, home, personal things, mobile, desktop, web Todoist is there to help me. Todoist team, great work, thank you!",
The app is very good. It makes more productive. The premium features are also good but one issue is that the price should be less for INDIA (INR). As the price is in dollars the price is high for INDIAN.,
It is easy to use and has helped me organize my tasks. Having it on the xomouter and my ohone makes it more accessible. Daily email reminders helps as well. Great app!,
todoist is the best. great for getting your life in order. it took 3 months but its now du riguer. the only thing its missing is the ability to do high level multi phase projects - i want to use it for my work,
What the hell !? It is indeed a good app for managing tasks but the most annoying thing in this app is that there is no reminder or notification for a task set at certain time. This is such a basic feature but this is paid in this app. Is this a joke? I've seen many people complaining about this problem.,
"Love the idea and functionality of the app but it consistently crashes for me. Luckily it saves the last edits made, however, it is still hard to use when it crashes so often",
"few bad part as a free user is it don't have windows shortcut to make the task from anywhere. another is there is no system to look the date and what are the current task on date... just like any calendar otherwise i really love sub-task, sub-sub task, sub project...this is really helpful to break a project into different parts",
The best app and desktop software I've found for my project/task management needs. I absolutely love that I can put several layers of subtasks into my project. Keep up the great work guys.,
"Have been using this app for a couple of years as my daily to-do list. It works well for that purpose. Would be better if one could embed pictures with items in the list, e.g. for shopping.",
Does exactly what the package says. Makes managing projects and to-do lists super fast and easy. I especially like the repeating lists feature.,
"One week in, so far so good! With the mobile app, the windows app, and the chrome extension I can access my list anywhere. I'm becoming a productivity master. Will upgrade to premium soon.",
"How do I take off all the auto generated things todoist adds to my list? It makes me feel more stressed when you add things like ""vacuum clean all rooms"" or ""check work emails"". How can I have a simple list that only I add to? It stops me from even opening the app, anymore. I hate seeing a list of tasks someone else created for me.",
"I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this.",
"Basic options locked from free app and only available under a subscription and marketing emails after just signing in with Google. If you just want reminders, as I did, this is severely over-developed.",
Awesome app very easy to use with in-depth features that have solved my should I stick with paper system vs going digital. Todoist is the one app that has made me make the switch and its great üëç,
Really good. Used Google keep normally but it's better since it offer automatic scheduling and rescheduling options. Rough time with tuition but when I graduate I plan to use premium.,
Great to-do list app! Does everything I would expect. The only feature I wish it had is to be able to log in to two different accounts and switch between them easily.,
sync between gcal was so bad that I wasted plenty of time waiting to add a single task. For almost half a year it worked fairly nice but that problems with sync today was enough to lose any trust for keeping important task on that platform,
"Fighting the input method rather than getting stuff done. ""Natural language"" will no way allow me to set a task called ""Register for 3 Oct SAT test"" for this Friday. Something simple as adding a note requires Premium. I'm going back to ToDo",
"One of the best tools to get things done. Easy to use, clean interface, synchronization across multiple platforms. Powerful, yet quick to master. Highly recommended!",
"The perfect app for to do lists. You can have multiple lists, transfer items between lists, and share your lists. I use it all the time.",
Super easy to use. I am a full-time college student and Todoist helps me keep track of what assignments I have due when. I honestly would be failing all my classes if it wasn't for this app.,
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.,
"They just added a 5 project limit. I now have to move all the information I had on this to another to do list. If you want any type of organization with your to do lists, this is not for you. If you just want a to do list and don't care how it is organized, then this is perfect.",
I dislike the update but mostly I dislike that it was changed and I had to look here to find out why. If you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when I open it. I am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration.,
"Great app, I use it all the time to stay organised! The latest update tho has made it so the text on my homescreen widget is white though, so I cannot see the text on the white Todoist theme.",
Mostly good experience with a few bugs here and there with reminders. I also like the API they provide that allows me to write some custom integrations for personal use.,
"I am satisfied with using this, but the task list widget sometimes does not work properly and freezes or works slowly, for example, after selecting completed tasks. I hope that the problems of the widget will be fixed in the next updates",
"Paying to see the completed tasks clearly shows poor pricing strategy. Charging makes sense for more advances features like... Collaboration, Repeat Reminders etc but not for checking you own completed tasks for a given day or week etc.",
"I love this app . It's Practical and useful . The project thing is soo good . I make projects like someday/ maybe , 2021 goals and routine.. Labels are also good. I would have been happier with one time payment. Make a notes app next .üòÉ Edit : For those who forget , put that big widget on your home screen üòé Pls improve your widget",
"Love everything about this app and its functionality. Only snag I've ran into is my task items not updating to the correct times after daylight savings. Love that I can simply type ""daily at 4pm"" and the app knows what to do!",
"Makes it easy to keep track of everything I want get done, helps break it down and keep track of progress, and stay focused on top priorities until they are completed.",
"Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none.",
an amazing app that has really helped me get my life together and organized,
Great app. I am just using the free version. This app is a great place to put all the things i think of during the day that I need to do. Its super convenient to use. I also enjoy the karma part of the app that rewards you for checking off tasks,
"Reminders require pro (paid) version. Even then, there is no opstion to snooze at a different time. UI and UX feels confusing and non intuitive.",
"So far, so good. Love the encouragement in teaching daily goals. Shows overdue and can reschedule items. A personal assistant. With ADHD, need that. Less stress. Thx!",
Pathethic! you have to pay to get a basic feature such as reminders on your phone! Reminders should be free as it's basic core requirements for any to-do app. Happy to have switched to TickTick app with reminders etc all for free!,
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain",
Easy to use. Clean interface. Does exactly what a todo list should do. My wife and I use it to help run our small business. The sharing feature is wonderful.,
"No easy to use, all features I need like reminders and labels in expensive version ($36). Not going to put out that kind of money, when can't even figure out how to use it.",
"Good App. Unfortunately, some of the features that I would like to use such as the list of tasks completed and their analysis are in premium / paid version.",
Makes day to day tasks easier to remember and adding to the list is easy with auto recognition of date formats and tags. I can't say enough about how helpful it's been to help me get organized and make my day calmer.,
"Hate the fixed days off setting b/c I work very irregular shifts. Uninstalled. EDIT: to dev response - irregular means different days every week. Far too complicated to bother. Perhaps add option to switch this off entirely, ""forcing"" it just makes things too complicated.",
"Sadly this app is no longer usable. The notifications have stopped working and I am even unsure if this is a ""paid"" feature now. I followed all previous advice I could find from todoist and from general android sources. Either way after an hour or trying I have to leave for another app until the notifications start working.",
Everything is simple and convenient. But there needs to be an activity log or completed task section. Not being able to track the completed tasks is a dealbreaker.,
"Using this app for atleast 5+ yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature !! I mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but that's unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start. Goodbye Todoist Edit (after reply): So you mean, me & every other person who is complaining are all wrong. Reminders were never premium until some time ago. I was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan. Have courtesy to not lie atleast :(",
"If you like checking boxes off, this is a great app. You can create lists, sublists, and even nest tasks inside of a list. It's a great organizational list app.",
"The app automatically hides completed tasks, making it practically unusable if you want to be able to track what steps you've completed with out having to actively look for them every single time you move between projects.",
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS! I used it for one month, and now that I have gone through the cancelation procedure 3 times, I am still being charged. No humans to reach to, try to put in a ticket for contact, and all it is is a circle of ignorance an frustration. Again, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.",
"Thought it needed my email just for an account. Won't stop sending me spam messages to do my tasks! Uninstalled weeks ago and still sends me messages. Don't recommend this at all, would rather use Microsoft or Google tasks.",
"It's very very costly for individual use .Can you roll out premium for Individual and family plan, instead of only team of upto 25people support? This would make it worth for user like me who uses this app for individual use and not for team level tracking",
Spent a solid 30 minutes trying to figure out how to make a task repeat. Very unintuitive layout.,
"I used to have an issue with the calendar, but now it is sorted üëç Now I cannot imagine managing my task without todoist. It is easy to use and it helped me a lot, thanks for the great application.",
I love this app and tried to buy the pro version but unfortunately I can't because nomatter what account I use to download the app or which one I sign into the app will only sign into the one account with payment problems. I wish I could sign into a different one to buy the paid upgrade,
"A really great app. It has a built in calendar, reminders, priorities and labels. It's significantly improved my list making.",
Great app! We share the shopping list. So it's easy for whoever goes shopping! Simply ask Google to add items to your list or add manually. I mainly on use the shopping tab.,
"Flexible enough to accommodate many styles. we share some ""projects"" across the whole family like the shopping list so we always know the latest need or if someone has picked something up already. Also great for organizing personal a d professional projects.",
"Turned around my productivity life, slowly but surely. It's all in how you use it: I recommend starting slow with a couple tasks a day that you already do and then slowly adding things you find you need to do. Clean interface and helpful karma system.",
l got it just for the connection with google assistant and have tried multiple times to get it to work with it but it continues to say TODOIST ISNT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW I am sooo frustrated and dissapointed. l hope this can be fixed l was really considering the paid version before l found out it didn't work at all with my google assistant or google home.,
My experience have been good. The app is simple and convenient to keep u on task. But it could have been better and therefore i have given 4 stars because I want a not to do list in this app to keep myself lazer focused on my ultimate goal.,
"I can't swipe right or tick a job as done from the options since latest update! what on earth have you done that for?! Now it seems I can only complete a job using that tiny, fiddley little circle. Not a good update.",
"Fantastic app; and the recent Foundations update made it even better. Great design, wonderful free functionality, good power user options, quick interface. I'm very happy. Thanks Todoist team!",
Great app for short-term and long-term checklists. Extremely helpful with task-activation and motivation when used thoughtfully. I recommend opting for premium.,
"It's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8AM or 10PM. If there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app, I'd give it a 5 star",
"Nice app! Even better in the premium option. However, I still have this phases when I don't fill in any tasks... My bad! But I'll try to become more organized, bc then todoist is a gamechanger",
"Useful, especially for setting recurring tasks (like watering houseplants, cleaning the fridge etc.). I love that you can set up projects to share tasks too.",
"I tried so hard but no. Grouping tasks as ""today"" in a ""Today"" list is not a clean design. I know there is some years of work on this, but app is becoming another Winamp.",
great for helping break down tasks and keeping track of progress. wish it didnt try to make me pay to set certain alarms weekly but I can always do that myself ig.,
"Great app. But I have a problem. When the phone is not working, the sound of a completed task is heard. And if I restart my phone, this problem doesn't occur until I open the app again.",
"They kept updating the system to make it worse and slower, eg instead of clicking I now have to alt click. I LOVE it when my external brain is proprietary SaaS that I get to rent but have no control over.",
What gives you as much flexibility as you need: + projects to grope tasks + lables + powerful filters alow you to create you personal views But: - it is possible to syncronize ONLY one google calendar!!! (which is funny as for Editor's choice app) - it is not possible to grope labels to set common color or search pattern - it is not possible to label a project so that all tasks created in a project get this label. I hole guys will fix the issue with calender otherwise all props do not worth it.,
"Ive been using this app for a long time now, fairly consistently and I find it very helpful for organizing. Its much faster and easier to make notes and get things done its great!",
"it's great! I can add all of my chores on their necessary dates and it always reminds me. as a scatterbrain who also has high expectations for myself, this helps me manage both tendencies.",
Used it for 5 minutes. This app does not have the ability to have your reminder repeat hourly daily weekly monthly yearly. It has none of that. How can you not have a repeat function? You guys don't think that people want to be reminded of things on a weekly basis or a daily basis or monthly basis or yearly basis?,
Was great until I switched to a Galaxy S22+. Now I get notifications up to 45 minutes late. Not very good for an app that should give you a reminder on time. Setting new notifications is wonky too.,
"Throw anything into the Inbox, to sort later (or right away) using Priority, Schedule (with reminders), Labels and Projects ""folders"". Set up a workflow that suits you any it's very helpful and simple to use!",
I like the design and speed of the app But some features are behind a pay wall that are very helpful ( but they need to get money someway right ) The only thing that i dont like about the app is that its not possible to schedule repeting tasks,
"It's great to have a separate app for todo lists that's always super fast, simple and reliable! Great features for organizing: time plan, projects, sections!",
"Todoist improves on everything I never thought you could improve on with Todo list apps. A beautiful UI with no gimmicks, plus features I didn't even know I needed. I really love it.",
"This app has really help me keep myself organised. The option to share tasks is also great - whether used for grocerie shopping, work projects or even holidays - it just makes coordinating plans so much easier! Love this app!",
"This has helped me become more productive than I thought I could be. The projects are immensely helpful when it comes to organizing what you have to do for what tasks, and it gives you a notification every day you have tasks, so you don't forget. It really helps productivity become more of a lifestyle, rather than a hobby. 5 stars!",
"Best to do app I've tried including original Wunderlist. Premium well worth it. UPDATE: Please increase the 300 task limit if possible. Annoying to have to fix at times. Plus being the premium version, it should be over that max allowment. Thanks!",
"Update 2: My question is solved for now. Thanks. I think it was just some delay because of holidays. Update:Ticket id 566206 I like the functionality of the app. I've been using it for more than a year. But: Do you have a support team? I created a ticket on Jan, 3d but my question is still neither solved nor even answered.",
"Love it. Priorities are here, tasks done are recorded, and just everything u need for a to-do list app. Thank you developer! Highly Recommend.",
"After recent updates. The homescreen widget stopped functioning. It would only work if app is running in background. If app is killed from recent sis apps, the widget stops working.",
"Very efficient app, a real time-saver ! And since the last update, a new widget extremely well-made and customizable : you don't even need to actually open the app !",
"Subscription required to set reminders? That's basic functionality for a To Do app. The app looks nice, and some features would be worth the subscription.",
"This app has saved my life at work and in my personal life. It's so easy to use, great interface both on phone and desktop app. Brings me joy and lessens my anxiety!",
It's a great app for the one's who don't want to waste their very single moments in this life. It's helpful in achieving goals and to increase productivity in your daily life. Thank you so much to #Doist. Keep moving forward ‚ô•Ô∏è,
"Works great! Multi-platform, great for establishing workflow and scheduling. Love it! Has made a significant improvement in how I manage my personal life and priorities.",
Sort by priority works differently now. It's only temporary and that's not what I need. If I add 10 new tasks with priority I don't want to change the order for all tasks manually.,
"Great app! User interface is smooth. Only minor gripe is that some options are a little more hidden than I'd like to see, so takes a little getting use to.",
Effortless to add and maintain tasks and to-do lists. I am planning on combining this with Evernote but Todoist often makes it feel like it's more than enough for organising my daily activities.,
"I just want to say thank you so much. My mental health has not been this good since I was a teenager. I am finally able to keep track of all the things that usually end up piling on top and smothering me until i feel hopeless. This is an amazing app. I have tried several other similar ones, but this does exactly what I need with such a simple interface. I wish the developers all the good fortune in the world!",
"Beautiful todo list app with almost all the features i need except for reminders which is only limited to paid plans. Overall, a great todo app with minimal design and excellent customer support.",
You have started making it worse. You killed the fun and satisfaction of swiping and checking off the task completely out of the screen by boomeranging it back while swiping. Looks like I have to develop a Minimalist To Do app on my own.,
"Great app! Would be nice if a note function can be added to any date as an option instead of task. By doing so, users can not only add tasks but notes of the day too.",
I purchased a premium but in the app it doesn't allow me to create more than 5 projects and it says upgrade to premium. This is rediculous. The funny part is when I click on upgrade to premium again it says you have it already. I want a full refund.,
Was sceptical about this app when someone told me about it but now it has replaced my notebook and I've converted to the paid version! Really easy to use and quick to add items.,
"Being a developer myself i use this app every day and its awesome. Email alerts, push notifications and more just make it sweeter. On top of that I cant stare at bright and vibrant windows all day and seeing that they took people like me into account with a dark mode is just awesome. Thank you guys keep up the good work!",
Only used it for 2 days but really wish I could see all the accomplished tasks that were scratch off. It's a basic to do list app and nothing more unless you pay for the premiums.,
Overall I like the app. However a large frustration is that showing completed tasks resets on switching views. Please add this. Visual confirmation is a hugehelp to productivity.,
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving.",
"Task apps have come a long way. Use across Mac os, iPad and Android. Really love this app, simple to use, categorise, file, date, action, etc and syncs seamlessly. Paid for premium student option",
"the app is good and easy to use. it will send you email reminders and overdue task. too bad for more useful functions, you will have to pay for it. but it is still useful as is.",
"Its really not clear how to set recurring tasks, which is the reason I chose this to do app as apparently it could. I've read the help guide and still can't work it out.",
"Great app, good at keeping you accountable and productive. Would be nice to be able to re-order your to-dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done",
"This is the best personal productivity app in the marketplace. Its usability is top notch, its design and flow is smooth and customizable. Its API is a delight to use as an integration-savvy consumer. I trust todoist to be the brains of my family life and even sometimes my career life.",
"Great app! So easy to use, keep everything organised with reminders so I don't have to think. The widget keeps me up to date with what needs doing today. So many great little features!",
"Support is terible even on paid subscription: due to some problem with sinhronisation with todoist's servers (it was writen in the sistem message in the app) I've lost data for the whole evening of planing for two weeks ahead. I have mailed to support (648200) - no response in 24h. So, since I have to continue planning things, now I basicaly forsed to redo all planing manualy without understaning the reason of the problem and any insuranse, that next time, I will need help, it will be provided.",
"An amazing app to plan daily & shleduled tasks, goals as well as projects. Easy & user friendly UI. Whether user just wants to note some random tasks or very specific scheduled tasks & projects; it's useful.",
"The best todo app in my opinion. The filters, search, available on all platforms I can think of, and ease of use. Thank you todoist!",
Easy and quick to use. An ideal companion for task management using the additional tools you get with the subscription. Thanks :),
This is a great app. One thing I suggest is time ranges. Im getting a bit frustrated with the fact that I cant make an appointment from say 2:00pm to 4:30pm for example. It would help to have time blocks to visualize my schedule. Would this be possible?,
"Not intuitive or easy to use. Has great features built in, but actually being able to learn how to use the app is very clunky and off putting.",
"I would really love to see a pomodoro timer, habit tracker, and a kanban board. The subtasks management could be better as it is in TickTick. I really love how Todoist have 2-way Google calendar sync.",
I love the way you can set priority levels for tasks !,
"Great app, but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder, it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder. I appreciate that, becouse no one will give you his work as a free. Ok, i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which I need.",
Super helpful. It's easy to add tasks to any category or sub category and assign them to an individual all in one step. Helps me and my husband keep track of what needs done and how busy the other person is.,
It would be so great if they add a calendar to this app,
"Very easy to use, I like using the widget on the screen and always write by myself the day and hour (which transform automatically by the app). Recommend it!",
great app! Allows to track my tasks very flexible way,
"Really, I have to try for hours to create a password to delete this app? And there is no way to do it.",
Ok so reason it's not 5 stars is because of one thing that I'd like as a feature and that is to change the colour of priorities as this would be an aesthetic thing I'd enjoy. Other than that extremely good for organisation and motivation.,
"My previous review seems to have been deleted. I don't need to have my schedule fed to Google. A sheet of paper is all that I need. There is even a GTD app in book form, probably for the same reason. Uninstalled, but that didn't stop the spamming.",
"USER BE WARE:if you want timely reminders of what you need to DO that you put in your TODO app.Per task notifications are behind a paywall! Bulk reminders in the morning and evening does not alleviate the issue.I need this so I don't forget what to do WHEN I have to do it!And that's what's happening,because the devs don't think that BASIC notification feature parity that every.other.free.app.has.should be free.Why even let me set a time!? +1 star for fine UI,webapp,and handy NLP ig. What a joke.",
"Buggy. Widget unresponsive, selecting a project overrides with inbox when you type ""everyday"". Sometimes.",
"Works great, easy to move unfinished tasks. why the 3? because they want 3 dollars a month to review completed tasks. there are others out there that don't charge.",
Really good app but recently iam seeing a lot of bugs like - when I am adding task it is not getting added . Projects are getting created randomly which is very irritating. Other than this it is 5 ‚≠ê,
"Real useful to organise tasks by project so I can sort my work from my home, and I can also sort by priority, who it's assigned to, due dates etc. Glad it syncs across devices and can work offline too. I'm loving the widget to see all your lists from your phone home screen.",
"What a pointless app. I had to google how to set recurring daily tasks, and then it didn't actually remind me at the times i set. I'll get a pen and notepad and write an actual to-do list next time",
"It is a phenomenal app, I have just one suggestion, can you make the repeating sub-tasks not appear on the main list, it clogs up the interface.",
its minimalist style is so nice and simple to understand and it has a lot of options as well to organize and prioritize and various options to help you get more focused and your to dos,
"Very easy to use with a simple interface and plenty of features. The web version syncs with the app, and is just as easy to use. I'm more productive already.",
I had a bad time with time Management at work and at home. Now with my samsung and the routines I can get up this is the first app that wakes up in the morning. Giving me an opportunity to set up the day how I want and check them off as they're done.,
Easy to add and monitor tasks. Projects are a collection of related small tasks making the whole thing seem less daunting. Synchs PC to smartphone to smartwatch seamlessly.,
Amazing app. Keeps me updated with all the tasks I have to do and when they are Or will be overdue. Really like the project feature so we can seperate the kind of tasks.,
"There is a sort function, but each time i made amendment or add item, it will not sort automatically and i need to manually press sort again in order to have clear view of my outstanding item according to urgency.",
Great app for staying organized. I share it with my husband and we organize our tasks together as a team. The articles and templates are helpful for making the most out of the app.,
"Amazing app, the premium experience offers the entire app but even without you have enough to track tasks and the satisfaction of ticking it off the large list of things needed to be done.. To the devs, great work can't wait for any updates I'm a fan forever and what ever device I might get next will have this app",
"its really good. you can schedule tasks, and create projects and goals. but if you just want an app to remind you that its time to dk a specific task, you can do that too.",
"So far so good. I like the projects and sub task features especially. Only been actively using for about a week. Great for todos, not totally sold for checklisting yet.",
Pretty good. Sync to calendar not easy to figure out. Similar to Wanderlist but better. But could use some features like Microsoft ToDo.,
It's really awesome and very helpful. It would reach more and more people if the premium version is available at a little lesser price. Appreciate the Todoist team. Thank you.,
"This app is very helpful. And I have only been using this app for some weeks. And It can help me for everything I need to do in life like school, meetings, taking notes and more. But I just wish it had a calendar. But I still love it!‚ù§Ô∏è",
"***Update*** The app is working perfect on both web, phone app and Chromebook app. The AI is very intuitive and once you learn small nuances, it is the best To Do list / Reminder on the market.",
"The integration with Alexa is a big benefit. I can sit on the couch, think of my projects and dictate tasks. Next 7 day recap is available on my phone, tablet and PC, great stuff!",
"I'm really enjoying using Todoist so far. I've used lots of productivity apps, and this one tops the list for me in terms of organising my daily and weekly to-do lists.",
Awesome App. For first time in my life I feel in control. Projects is great idea. So easy to add tasks and schedule them with natural language processing. Big thumbs up for the team.,
"I keep this on the home screen of my phone, and look at it more than I do my daily planner. It's user friendly, easy graphically, and helps me stay very organized with all that I have to do for my day and work.",
"Good for small lists and limited organizing. A limited and greedy platform. An app that requires a subscription, but should use a sold pro version. Idk who pays for this as a subscription but they are over valuing the seevice.",
This is a great product that helps to keep my life organized. I love how I can add tasks and projects with ease and can mark them off easily as well. I would always recommend that people use apps like this.,
I'm using Todoist to organize all my projects hobbies chores and I even set up a task list for my next batch of beer everything from buying my ingredients to bottling. it works so great. I love the widget I can see what I have scheduled and check them off without opening the app and finding the task. Haven't had it set up to share projects yet but soon.,
"Really intuitive, much easier and simpler to use than some other to-do apps I have tried! I immediately upgraded to premium and it was very affordable.",
"Please fix the bug that automatically toggles ""reset recurring subtasks"" on every time I open the app! So frustrating to mark off ""chores"" (daily) & have 57 completed tasks repopulated as past due!",
"You have to buy premium to set an alarm for the reminders, otherwise it emails it to you, which is bullcrap. It also refuses to save a specific time for the reminder to be sent",
I *love* this app [esspeciakly as a Nerodivergent person] My brain doesn't work with traditional calendars cause there's no objective you don't finish a task this enables organization for my scatter brain cause I go in and check off what I'm doing when it's done so doctor apt gets checked off so I can avoid over booking cause it's in my to do list while also remembering the stuff thats not strictly timed just needs done,
Great app! I use it to keep track of work projects and my tasks for courses I take for my masters. The free version is perfect enough for what I use it for.,
This is a very good app for note taking but i deleted it because i found another app. When i unistalled it it still kept sending me emails saying that i have some tasks pending. Even after 1 month i still get emails. Please fix this issue,
A great way to keep track of honey do lists. We just had our first child and both my wife and I are mentally exhausted so it is easy to let things slip through the cracks. The shared project is great for us to communicate even if we are on different sleep schedules. I just wish there was a way to pin the current project to be the first thing that opens up instead of the daily view of the current day. Would definitely recommend.,
"This app is great, designed well, powerful and easy to use. I don't regret upgrading one bit. I think the karma stuff is unnecessary, but I'm glad I can just disable it. Keep it up. ü§ô",
"Awesome app, but... Sharing is borked on Android 13",
"Just beginning to use it, as Premium, and I,m really happy. It,s, up to now, the only app of its kind which fulfills my label, filters, functions, etc needs and, wow, allows me to personalise them!",
"One of the first things you notice, Todoist app feels like it really DID have effort put into it by devs and not to just find another way or place to inject an ad in, but to make money by actually making the app GOOD.. it feels like the devs themselves DO use the app, it''s like they made it for themselves - usable and functioning, because they couldn't find anything on googlestore that's practically usable for task management, and then they marketed it because others probably feel the same. . That's what a good dev is - make product actually good and money comes flowing naturally, and you don't need to hide your guilt by excuses",
"Without knowing anything about the app it forces you to create/connect an online account first. After that for the reminder app to send you reminders, you need to pay for a subscription not even a one time fee. What a joke!",
"After searching through loads of Todo list apps finally found one that works for me, great interface, very customiseable, sad that some features are locked behind premium but works fine for free",
"I've been using it for about a week & it has some nice capabilities, although I wish there was a cheaper offer for premium. Also, some of the functionality is a little difficult to figure out, but you get used to it.",
"Completed tasks are hidden from the default view. There is no way to enable them. This used to be possible, but it was removed for some reason. Not being able to easily tell what has already been done defeats the purpose of a todo app.",
"Loving this to do app so far. Intutive, easy to use interface with just the right set of features. Would recommend it for your to do lists",
"Took a minute to figure out the terminology, but once I did, the literal best app I have on my phone. This is only the second app I've felt strongly enough about to take a minute to write a review. It's good. You need todoist. Period.",
"Not the most features, but probably the most balanced of the to-do list apps. Sync and speed are very robust.",
Some really critical features missing like start time support. I won't want to look at a task all day that I have no ability to complete until later. It needlessly creates a feeling of unproductiveness when you're list is larger than the reality of the tasks justify.,
Just on the basic unpaid version and loving it. Perfect to keep track of everything with baby brain right now. The paid version seems pretty good too and might upgrade once I'm back to work,
Pretty cool way to organize my life. Lots of options for sorting tasks into groups and having different colors to label priority. Really helped me get some much needed order in the chaos of my life.,
Not happy with this app. Saying that reminder is a premium feature and we have to pay for that. Then what is the difference between this app and the phone calendar app? I prefer to use my phone calendar app as it has all the features such as reminder. Uninstall your app by the way. It is useless.,
"shortcuts to quick actions like add task and search have disappeared in last version. edit: no response from the developers, changing the review to 1 star edit 2: developer replied with a link to instructions, which helped: log out and log in again. changed rating to 5 stars.",
"Removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version, and the price is way to high. looking elsewhere :-(",
"This app is so much easier to collaborate with my team(s) on deadlines, details, and new jobs. . I've used other apps designed for developers that are too complicated for teams in different industries. I set my boss up with this app and it's helped organize his freelance clientele so much. We can always be updated on new clients and a checklist of what needs to be done. Todist is now a daily tool in my personal life too. üëç",
The best part is it is able to sync perfectly with my galaxy watch 4 unlike many other Todo apps.other apps i tried they wud not update phone app when i mark a task from the watch.but i just wish the buttons & fonts could be a bit smaller.,
"Came here from Wunderlist. Seems that Wunderlist had most of the features for free that this app requires premium for. However, I love the smart-date feature and cross platform sync. Great app!",
"Superb app. Simple and uncluttered, but packed with features and versatility. Continuous improvement with incremental updates and tweaks.",
this app really helped me improve my time management skills and overall stress levels. I found writing even the smallest tasks gave me the motivation to keep going!,
"Good free to do list. I like that it's shareable so you can coordinate with employers/employees. Haven't seen any ads, so that's definitely a plus!",
Todoist rules because they stick with what they're good at and don't clutter up the app with a bunch of half-@$$ed junk. Todoist is not a Swiss Army Knife. It's a perfectly honed chef's knife and you'll use it all the time.,
The app is organized and easy to use. A good amount of settings easy to find what you need. Writing a note is fun because of the design intuitive.,
"This app has blown me away! Rarely if ever rate an app, but there are no ads, and the free version is still incredibly highly functional... Just so impressed- well done to the team!",
Best to do list app out there. I've used other similar apps but they are either way too overloaded with features or just too basic. Todoist has got the balance right.,
"Apart from the emails (which you can probably turn off), I really like this app. It helps me to set small goals for each day, thus working towards a larger goal.",
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly.",
"The best, most responsive task manager app I have come across",
"1) Why are you disabling enter key's next line function? When I click enter key, ""Next line"" does NOT come. So I used other apps to type with new lines by using enter key. 2) Now when I cut and paste the exact contents from another app, even then, it does NOT appear line by line. It appears as a paragraph.",
I'm boring of that. On every new update Todoist team fix a bug and at the same time it create new bugs. Some section task deleted after 2-3 seconds of their creation... Please help me this make Todoist unreliable...I'm a royal premium member for many months... Please fix it...And prease review well the code before any update... I will change my rating after the fix thank you.,
"To-doist has been excellent for keeping my busy life organized! As a graduate student with a part time business, an internship, and multiple relationships being able to keep all of my pressing tasks organized and accessible is absolutely necessary to me staying on track.",
"App used to be good, used it for chores and household tasks. Now the Today page no longer shows which Project and/or Section a task is listed under (I have a Cleaning project with Sections for each room). So now I have two ""Clean sink"" tasks in my Today page, and I wouldn't know which two sinks it's referring to. Master bathroom sink? Guest bathroom sink? Kitchen sink? Really annoying, I have to now click on them to find out. Bring back the label that showed each task's Project and Section.",
A very good apps. It helps me a lot when it comes into managing my time. I love the features where I can set time by simply typing at 8pm for example. Good job developer,
This app is sooooo helpful for me as a student to help me stay focused and productive. It gives little reminders to get you back on track and it's a must for any student or busy person,
"It just is amazing. Its simple, tasks can be shared and also the way you wish to use it. It does boost your progress with the points system.",
"I have all my notes, tasks and little informations there and I've not experienced any bugs or disappointment where they'll vanish of a sudden. I trust this app and it's very good.",
It hS to be printable to be fully functionable and interaction with Google Calendar would be a plus. But it hax to be printable !!!!!!!-- Must be able to record activities and call them up for verification,
"Company got ridiculously greedy and started enforcing some really dumb rules on free accounts. Sad that I'll need to find a new solution for todo lists. Avoid this one. They randomly unshared a lot of lists me and my husband had and even deleted some, so we just lost a ton of data without warning.",
Great app! I love the projects portion that allows you to organize when you have the time. Plus the quick task that sends tasks straight to an inbox.,
I'm completely hooked to this app primarily because of the ease of adding tasks using natural language. Also the organization of tasks is simple yet effective. It has become a must have for me within a few days.,
"I absolutely love this app. It's gorgeously designed, so incredibly responsive and just EASY. I've used a ton of productivity apps and this one is the best by a mile. Your design and development teams have done a wonderful job. Thank you!",
"I encountered a small issue with the app not working correctly. After contacting the developers, they responded within 24 hours that a fix was already identified and planned to come out that week. Awesome service!",
"Was great until last update, widget scrolling is not smooth, scrolls back to the top after full scrolling. Marking tasks complete is really laggy, mostly end up clicking the wrong task.",
"First impression: when sending (via share) an item from another app to Todoist, it wants to create a separate item for each line of text üò´ and the confirmation message still has the {count} placeholder in it üòÇ Next, if you want to set an actual reminder for your first task, you have to upgrade to a $3/month subscription first üòÇüòÇüòÇ",
"i likd it but i think , u should not erase the entire task when its done. it should be in the app , in a done list folder . also , u should add a confirm button when.. we r going to mark the task done.. coz thers a chance of erasing the task accidentally as all it takes is a click",
"Almost perfect but unable to add tasks on top of the list. Tasks are always appened at the bottom, annoying! There should be an option to configure this",
It's a very good app. It helps me stay on schedule and isn't annoying about it. It also has a very good UI that doesn't look cluttered. Would definitely recommend,
"Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally",
"Borderline useless support. Came highly recommended and, in trying to learn about some functionality, I used FAQs to limited avail and then emailed. What a waste of time.",
"This app is moving towards the garbage heap. The free tier is a laughable insult now, it barely qualifies as a trial, completely unusable. If you're looking for a todo app, try elsewhere, like zenkit or notion. To top it off, the new android redesign is an unmitigated disaster. Steer clear.",
"great app. I would like a bit more convenient reminder system. For example, insead of having to write the reminder, we can have instant reminder options",
"Another simple app with a subscription plan... This is not the right strategy to attract more people... This kind of app should be a one time payment no more. Whatever the number of apps with this strategy, it doesn't make it a good one.",
"I absolutely love todoist. It is such a game changer! Makes my life so much easier, I would be lost without it. The app is awesome, very user friendly and straight forward.",
"Feedback: love this app. One thing thats annoying is that my lists don't get synced between my pc and the todoist widget. I have to open the app, and then it syncs",
Was 5 stars lowering to 2 so hopefully they see this - make the completed tasks section it's own thing again why would I want it merged with my existing tasks? Makes it very hard to find accidentally closed tasks or to look thru historical data. Dont think this change was necessary,
"Is there a way to rollback previous UI? The new UI introduces more clicks for the same action - which decrease my productivity. If I need to modify the name and due date for the same task, I need to save twice instead of one time(previous design)",
"Signed up for premium. Asked about integrating Todoist into my Gmail and Slack workflow. It took 8 days for the customer service to respond, just so they could tell me it wasn't possible. No helpful suggestions. No work around. They might have well have said ""hey thanks wasting your money with us."" What a waste.",
"It almost perfect, it is missing a selection tool, where you can select more than task and delete them at once, also there is no way I can turn a normal task to a sub task to other normal task",
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited.",
"In a world that follows the 80/20 rule, this app has gone well beyond 80%. Attention was paid to the details!",
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!",
"Seems pretty good, but totally crippled the free version by not allowing reminder notifications. What's the point without those? Not bothering with it.",
"to those who struggle with the checkbox and general widget issues (or other problems): google ""todoist 13.5 apk"" to find a verison that works better. latest version is completely unusable and destroys my wohle todoist workflow",
"Great if you don't mind paying a monthly subscription fee. Don't bother with the free version, even simple reminders are behind the pay wall..",
"In the latest update, filters don't work. Please solve this problem. Following the response to the original review. I logged out and login back and the problem is gone now. Thanks to Doist inc for the help.",
"Amazing product! no idea how i got through my weeks without it. saved my many times, cuz I'm forgetful and this keeps me organized with tasks, on each day, what priority they are.",
Very useful for capturing ideas on the go and reminding me I have to do them. 10/10 excellent functionality and speed. Very easy to use,
"I have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating. Before applying the update, I had hoped to find documentation about changes. Found nothing on the todoist website, no comments in reviews. Update is attempting to be pushed, where's the documentation????",
A great app for task keeping one of if not the best one available My only request is to have an auto refesh function for the widget as it wont update unless the app is specifically opened,
would be nice to have some things ability to set a time estimate for a task then show if time estimates for a day go over your working hours in the day or something. helping you to organize tasks and set realistic expectations for getting things done. would be optional to use,
I like that you build up a score as you complete tasks. The email/push notification options are helpful for when life gets hectic.,
"Quite a great app Keeps me updated, easy to work with and optionalize features such as the colour of the background Great for someone that can't keep an organized planner or too much to remember",
Free version is useless. I don't recommend buying something you can't try. Most of the basic features like reminders are not available in demo.,
"Reminders are a premium feature, which is what I needed this app for. It really sucks that I can't use reminders for free. I have to continue the search for a good reminders app.",
With latest version shared boards don't sync between devices. Update (2021-03-01) - for some reason now it syncs shared dashboard again. Great app very usefull.,
"Overall, I like the app but I think it can be easier to schedule reminders and the integration with Outlook does not work.",
"It's really nice but I wish the notifications were better, like for some reason I don't get notified even though the task is due. It would also be good if we can add URLs beneath the name of the task, so that we can directly visit the link.",
This app is changing my life. I feel so much better about myself. It is wonderful to be able to complete planned tasks and this app really helps to manage procrastination in a non-intrusive manner ‚ù§,
The new widget made the app almost unusable for me. Not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way.,
Several features are limited if you don't have the premium version but it's still really useful. I use the widget on my homescreen very often.,
"It is the best To do manager I've ever used. Simple yet powerful, it elegantly helps me keep on track every day. I've been using it for years and would highly recommend it!",
The app is great because it's cross-platform solution and has a lot of useful features. My only advice is that the shift between projects could be easier.,
"IS THERE A WAY THAT I CAN GET A REFUND FOR MY FRESHLY RENEWED SUBSCRIPTION???? I have used this app for over a year and when my subscription came up for renewal, it stopped syncing accross platforms from my PC to my Android phone.   No solution! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",
"This the best and is very customisable at its every level. But I didn't like that blocked reminder for pro plans which big letoff, other integration should be reserved for pro plans but reminder should be made available.",
"The app sounded great, but the fact that the primary feature, REMINDERS, is a premium feature, is ridiculous. Don't bother downloading if you want a functional app.",
"I love this app!! It is very essential to my every day life!! I am a huge procrastinator, and this app is helping me break this habit for good! I also love the rewards you get for finishing your task as planned!",
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package.",
"Early days, but so far it's doing everything I wanted & looks to have plenty more potential. I love the calendar integration particularly.",
I just updated to the latest Android version and now no tasks appear on my filters. But it's fine through the web browser. This was very good before this.,
"Easy to use, quick way to and and organise your tasks. Support of filters, labels, subtasks, projects and many other options to help you get everything done.",
Great app but the fact I can't see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if I'm free on specific day in the future insteas I need to check week by week is a deal breaker although I did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible. Will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app.,
"Get Todoist to Get Things Done ! Over past few years I have used multiple applications in the market. I Some of them being.. any.do, wunderlist, Google tasks, Google Keep, Trello and many more. After trying all of them, I came back to Todoist and became a paid member. For past 02 years Todoist has helped me getting things done and ensured that I am not missing out on important task at work and at home. Todoist is very generous in extending premium codes even for already premium users!",
"I really like this program, it's been very helpful keeping me organized. the only down side is i had to get the paid version for some of the best features but i think it was worth it.",
"Great for organizing to do items. Wish you could reset due dates in bulk, and a few other features would be nice, but overall great app.",
"Exceptional organizational tool that syncs across devices & apps, & with calendar automated reminders I never miss an important task. Part of my daily workflow. Highly recommend!",
"Easy to add tasks, looks good, just wish reminder was a free feature, but that's just me being cheap ! Great app so far, working on making it something I use daily.",
"Has really helped me boost my productivity, app is fantastic. So clean and really easy to use. If you're looking for an app to help productivity via to do lists - this is it.",
The app is great but I just need one more functionality. The ability to add every new event on the top of the list automatically. Do this and I will buy the app.,
you should disclose that your app requires a subscription in order to use it and then one must pay for it every year for the rest of their life.... this information should be displayed on the Play Store page where you sell your app .... it is my suggestion that you come up with a fair price to get paid 1 time for your app ... then it's a worthwhile apl otherwise you're wasting people's time and participating an absolute greed ...,
The only task manager app for Android and Windows with a dark theme. I also like that you can choose to focus on either due dates or individual lists.,
Pretty decent check list app. I like how you can set up reoccurring tasks. I recommend it for anyone moving away from paper planners.,
"It's a very good app... 1. But, when I deleted a task from No Section in A Project, The Entire Project Got Deleted... When I Clicked on Activity log, very Few Tasks with The Project Name Got Back... Correct It if can 2. If I Add A TASK, If I click send in my keyboard rather than arrow key in todoist, TASK will automatically move into a no section column instead of where ( a named section ) I typed it",
"This UX is amazing. Unload your thoughts when you have them, organize them when you get a second. Infinitely flexible. Get it done.",
best to do app EVER . been using it for years . fast interface and looks fantastic . does everything I need it to. would rate 10 if I could,
"Latest update has fixed the irritating issue where when you completed a task a floating box appeared over your other tasks, preventing you from selecting them. Thank you!",
Finding myself using this app a lot more than I thought. I'm not a very stoic/organised person but the app keeps pushing me to complete the daily tasks I have set and that's good for this guy. Great app. Keep it up,
"I was so overwhelmed and stressed out at work all the time before I discovered Todoist. Once I started using it, I felt like I could finally be productive. There have been several times where I've started to feel overwhelmed again, and then I realize how I could use Todoist to manage everything. It always works. I love this app, and I don't know how I would function without it. I tell everyone I know about it.",
It's a great app but it doesn't work because it keeps crashing all the time so almost impossible to use the app Edit: it seems to be fixed after the update,
"Wish the app suggests emojis based on the task you write. But other than that this app is an absolute game changers for me, it is unbelievable how this app can integrate with sooo many apps like google calander, trello, edge, notion .... This is the best To Do list app ever.",
"For sure, this app is good enough, but! After a year of usage they added reminder feature to a premium access. Without reminders your app is useless. Thanks a lot. Even comments went to premium. Completely useless app.",
"Great for people that like lists, I have the free version and it does enough to keep me satisfied. I'm sure there's much more to discover in the paid version but for my use case this is fine",
The app and the web version are not in sync. It's been a few days. Task that have been completed on the app are still on the web version.,
"Horrible experience Your team is incapable of good UI design. A normal low end developer could creat beautiful UI. Calander view is outdated,and useless.cant get any information from it. Can't even see subtasks attached to main task in main view. Worthless, outdated app.is your CEO sleeping or has enough money? Such a stupid, outdated design",
Great app for tracking tasks! Love the scheduling feature. I just started using it so I look forward to realizing its full potential!,
No reminder in the free version. A great downside of not using this app. I've been using other to-do planner and never had to pay to remind me.,
This is a cross platform we can create many projects. So do list is a very useful app every day. There are many different benefits of this app. All people should be used this app and fil good life,
"There is a bug with recurring tasks. If a task is overdue and it is supposed to reccur on the next day (today), the yesterday task stays as overdue and new task for today won't be there. If I had completed the task yesterday but I did not marked it done, I will have to reschedule the task for today instead of marking it done. If I mark it done instead, the yesterday task is completed and today's task does not show up.",
Couldn't see how to set reoccurring tasks. Don't have time to mess around trying to find basic things. Uninstalled.,
Don't have an account with this App. Kept on sending emails to me. Kindly delete if someone has given my email id. I have nothing to do with this application,
"This app helped me become more productive; I set myself 5 goals a day and I love ticking one by one off my list. I find it really helpful how todoist does reviews of all the completed tasks, as it gives me an insight into my productivity pattern. highly recommend!",
Very intuitive to use and highly customizable. Love the integration with Google Calendar. Taking my organization level to new heights!,
"I love having a to do list and this app makes it easy to check things off my list, or move them to another date. So far I have just used the free version, but I am seriously considering upgrading. I would love to have a way to see my ""done list""",
"Best ""to do"" app I try, very intuitive interface. My day now is completely organized. Karma feature is very interesting and motivating. Thank you for this amazing app.",
Best to do list. Fav part is pin notifications,
"Great app. And love the multi-crossplatform intergrations like with google calendar and Momentum. Just wish the design was more streamlined, like Listberry, then I'll be more inclined to use",
So far i liked it if it were open source i might have added 2 or 3 features of mine as well with those features it would be all time best app for me for task management. I will change ratings when I'll get those features as well even though I am its pro user,
As some one who is extremely forgetful I find this app really helps me get things done. I like how I can separate tasks in a way that some of them give me reminders while other more long term project sit on a list I can reference myself.,
"Everything is good but I can't turn on the show completed tast option from anywhere please add it, in the next update. Edit: I want the ""Show Completed Task"" feature in today or tomorrow tasks also, not only for projects.",
"Thought it was only phone problem, but after changing phones a couple of times, app widget still gets bugged. There're times when tasks are suddenly gone, then i had to redo putting the widget. Sometimes widget can't be clicked",
"Great app. Totally enjoying the premium feature. But I wish sorting out the list stays as I set it, instead of changing the sorting out method every time I want to view.",
The automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes. It would also be nice to have a maps integration - I do not think it is there.,
It was slow to get into (lots to digest can get swamped) however now that I am taking simple steps onto it it is becoming invaluable. Looking forward to getting more out of it daily.,
Overall pretty good. Wish there was a way to skip a repating task instead of falsely completing it. The list widget is pretty useful.,
"Can't receive notifications from the app, reminders, overdue tasks, due dates all don't work. It was working fine before, but certain update broke it.",
Seems pretty good but most of the options that make if stand out are not available unless you pay for it. Splendo is cleaner and easier to use.,
An easy to use tool that helps you keep track of all those little and big things going on in life. I especially like it's flexibility for handling tasks that repeat.,
"This app has definitely helped me survive this semester. It's really helped me manage work, life and engineering school while staying sane. Granted I'm also using a calendar and a physical weekly agenda.",
I think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect! I find myself constantly going back and forth between Todoist and Google calendar to schedule my stuff! All in all a great app though,
Loved the free version so much that I upgraded to the paid version within the first week. I've never done that with any other service. Todoist keeps my family organised. Can't imagine how I ever got anything done before it üëç,
I like that it has both projects and labels and you can query across both. I like the dark mode. Colors are a nice touch.,
"This app is nice but I don't like it because it only works with internet and there are some options which only work if I pay money, I disliked this app only because of those problems. If this app not contain those two problems I have given it 5 star. Anyways Thank you",
"Really love it so far, wish they had something for repeated tasks...would have given 5star otherwise. Week 1 , very happy. #edit: Thank you for the response :). I applied what u said and it is awesome. Changing to 5 stars , would give 6 for customer service !",
I've used several to do apps. Now I'm a Todoist loyalist! Todoist does everything I need across every platform plus endless app integrations. I'm nearly a todoist grand master and I'm still finding more uses and tricks for greater productivity. Tremendous app!,
This is a really good app which greatly enhanced my ability to manage my tasks and keep track of them. I mostly use the widget and almost never open the app itself.,
This has been helpful getting organized for my job but it wont allow you to have 2 separate accounts that have nothing to do with each other. I would like a personal account separate from this one. I would pay the premium for it. My boss would have to pay the premium for this one.,
I was not into productivity apps as such because I thought that it would just complicate the whole process but this app is really minimal and has all the necessary functionalites that one might need. Perfect.,
"Good app, but it's constantly crashing these days. It's always telling me that it keeps stopping.",
"I accidentally click on something and the whole note was deleted,dint even give an option saying do you want to delete the Note :( i wrote so many notes on the desktop and accidentally clicked something on the mobile and everything was deleted, no option to undo? No recycle bin or anything. Atleast ask for confirmation, some undo option for 3seconds.Very disappointed. SIR IF YOU CAN READ WELL, I SAID I ACCIDENTALLY DELETED IT DON'T KNOW WHAT I CLICKED ON THE MOBILE APP. WHY NO CONFIRMATION",
I used to like this. Then the updated it to include something called in Inbox which is just ruining it for me. I dont need that its making it confusing to keep track of things. I will be replacing this with another app.,
"Amazing app with so many features to organize our tasks. Initially I felt the app had so many features, it's complex to use and thought this app isn't for me. But once I learnt and understood all the features of the app and how to use them I am just loving this app.",
"Really good. and has a very good widget. but I can't keep using it because you can't add pictures, drawings, or recordings.",
"its amazing so helpful I recommend it to everyone who want to be organized and have everything planned for the next day, week even month so u can know what to do at that specific time again it's amazing",
"Basic version covers almost all you need to manage tasks. The name of the app reads tasks and reminders, but you need premium to get these. Misleading",
Amazing application. I was already motivated to do a lot of things but it's just so easier to be productive when you put those things out of your mind and write them down. I really feel that I am doing more things than before. This app is for me the best Todo app. It really suits me perfectly.,
Suits my needs perfectly. Pretty easy to figure out. Even the free version makes it simple to organise tasks in a clear way!,
"This is the best to do app I can find. I love that I can set due date, priority, and project by just typing (rather than a series of a thousand clicks like with other apps). I highly recommend.",
"This app is great for productivity, however I've recently ran into syncing issues with the app and the extension on my computer and I'm not sure how I should fix it",
"Found that on the phone app, the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited (100 or 200), but on the computer version there is no such limitation. Other than that it's a good app.",
Hlw!!! Company there is bug in the latest version I can't open the app. When I downloaded the app it couldn't open and then after I reinstall it couldn't open I'm facing same problem as earlier so asap fixed the bug,
"Cant use it if notifications dont work. Wont pay if I cant full feature test.....lets take this Corolla for a test drive, we can pretend its the Supra you imagine it might be... but first pay us to find out where you were just imagining vs how it really works....lol. Too bad, genuinely need a good working product.No thanks, it always requires mindless divulging of my banking info, you cant have that, if you have a product you trust let me see it,if I like it,you can have my banking info. Lol",
"It is great, with plenty of reminders built in and works across platforms. I wish there were more gamification elements.",
Such a a fantastic and intuitive app. The level of complexity available for a free product is amazing. My productivi has increased ten fold!,
"Great sync and cross-platform - many layers of nested tasks, easy integrations. I've tried tons of these, an this is my favorite by a mile.",
"It's not a bad app but I find it too cumbersome to navigate, I would have liked a simpler display of tasks, visually and organizationally it needs work.",
"The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps.",
"I like this app more than any other task/list management app out there, mainly because it supports infinite subtasking. A hierarchical structure helps breaking down tasks.",
I use the widget quite a lot and I have found it really difficult to mark a task as completed. It requires 3-4 clicks on the tick button to mark it is complete,
Bought the paid version and added various tasks on desktop. Won't even log me in or load anything. Downloaded the app to access my tasks and shows nothing. I even paid for premium. Very dissatisfied and disputing through my bank. This is worst than free apps like keepnote. Seriously disappointed,
I have searched a multi-platform app similar to ios reminders for a long time. My search finally finished after discovering Todoist. Todoist is able to fulfill a simple requirements that no other app is able to: recurring task. Thank you to all Todoist team for such contribution,
"Excellent dynamic app, the first time a to do list has worked for me. Easy to use. Now that I can track my own performance, I just have to change my own habits ;-)",
"Great app, I'd recommend to anyone that has problem solving, and anxiety issues. It helps me sleep to be able to make todo lists for the next day.",
Love the ability to add anything I want and color code tasks for visibilty. Wish there were as many colors for tasks as there was for labels though. Still 5 stars.,
"Honestly really liked this app, was 1 of the top 2 out of several however the ""rolling"" daily tasks is what lost me. Otherwise, this is much a newer, bigger, better version of Google Tasks...which I LOVE as well, however it has no share abilities.",
"I love a list that someone gives me to complete, but making the list is no fun for me. Todist makes sense and allows me to throw ideas in the inbox to handle later. It helps me better manage what I could not...me!",
"WARNING RE THIS APP. Got Premium, followed instructions to Integrate w/calendar w/vpn active, got security alert minutes later that an attempt was made to login to my email account w/my password. Had to hustle to protect my account. Thank you Google for superb alerts, shame on you Todoist for open back doors.",
Some kinda scam to collect email address.,
"And once again, here we have another app that gets worse with every update. Over complicating things. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I get what they are trying to do, but it has made it less user friendly and more restrictive. I wish I could revert back to the previous version. Currently considering going back to the previous app I used to use.",
Widgets are so huge (4x2) that they are unusable. I wish i had an option to use smaller widgets. I have tried another to do app and it had much smaller so usable widget.,
"This app so far has helped me to be more active with the days that I'm granted. See, I'm doing this thing called ""80/20."" I'll get my work done and go reward myself for completing my daily goals. This app is exceedingly productive and keeps you motivated with the Karma System.",
Simple straight forward functionality and compatible across different devices and browsers. I use it everyday and love it.,
This app is constantly having notification issue. For 6 months this issue would come and go and now it just stay. What are you using your subscribers money for if you're not going to properly fix the problem? I will not use todoist anymore.,
"Wonderful app i can't say how much I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è A note for the developer: please add the time for the task Often times tasks are the works that need to be done.but todoist lacks one key thing that is asking the user ""How much time do you want to do the task like 10 or 30 minutes"" It's a really big problem when you look at your time blocked calender but see a half hour work which would take 2 hours :mostly by todoist Other than that i could have given it 5‚ù§Ô∏è",
"Really like the app, but I've found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view, for some sections the tasks don't appear and the ""add another task"" button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position.",
"ü•∞ Smooth, versatile, effective. Syncs perfectly with Google Calender. Honestly the best to-do app I've tried (after much searching). I'm sooo organized ü§Øüí´ü§ë might go pro... üò≥üò≥üò≥",
"Nice interface, good help, good configurability. Integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though.",
Good for project management by related project and task lists. However when subnotes are needed a seperate notemaking application is necessary. The user interface is not made for making extended notes on projects and tasks.,
I really dislike the projects thing. Just let me make new lists. I want a list for movies to watch another for gift ideas etc. The best way to do that through this app is subitems which are a pain to deal with. Moving over to wunderlist,
Really love this app and so happy that my previous feedback was acknowledged. Only reason not 5 stars is my widget has stopped working. The widget is essential to keeping on top of my tasks! Please fix soon!,
"easy to use and works over many platforms. i like that there is a community of users and tutorials to help you maximize its utility for what you need. i also enjoy the karma feature, which gamifies productivity and helps me stay motivated",
"Pretty easy to use, once I put it into my routine, no problems with multi-device sync, works perfectly between my phone and smartwatch!!",
"This app is brilliant! I prefer quicky typing my TODOs with date & time, rather than picking it using the controls, and it does a beautiful job in processing my text.",
Putting REMINDERS behind a paywall pretty much means you're forced to pay for the app to get much use out of it,
"It works great. Using the free version to get to know it but I'm liking what I see, do, and get done. Update: The app is still going strong. It faces you with all the things that needs to be done. Scary but realistic. Didn't expect to get this much done by simply using an app.",
I feel so much more organized with this app. It helps me plan and prioritize my day and stay on track. I feel like I get more done and don't have things nagging at the back of my mind that I need to do because I've got them scheduled through todoist.,
"Very easy to manage tasks. Just don't know how to set to receive notifications for all tasks into project, not just for tasks assigned to me. Good job.",
"Really? You make a calendar/planning app and the force people to pay per month for it to have any form of reminders, even just local push notifications? Sorry, everything this does in Pro can be done with Google calendar for free.",
"Fast, intuitive, great sync times and seamless integration across platforms. recently discovered the team collaboration options and love them too!",
I found that the several tabs was unnecessary and prevents me to be productive. We have to pay for an app to get reminders. I'll rather use an app with ads if the reminder function is gone,
"A lot of basic functions are limited to a paid premium membership. Better off using a free app that doesn't restrict functions to premium users. Also, a karma level...? What? Like anyone needs some ridiculous feature like that. Sure... you give THAT to free users.",
"it keeps me remind of what I needed to do on the day, and the days that follow. planning helps to execute your days accordingly, without wasting any time one things that weren't part of the plan. that's when you'll notice the distractions. All in all, I like it.",
I've tried to use to-do list type applications before. I see the benefit in them. But they never really stuck with me. The customization and organization options in this app make it great. I use it daily.,
I added a bunch of stuff to the schedule and went to check it the next day and all of the data was gone. I deleted the app. Useless.,
Useless. Installed this and got partner to install. Not possible to share projects. Help section describes clicking on something that isn't there.,
"I decided to try this app out before work on a Sunday. The app immediately said ""enjoy your day off you deserve it"" but it was not my day off and I could not edit it, so I just stopped using it.",
"Overall, it's pretty darn good. The only problem I have with the app right now is that the crown doesn't work for scrolling. Please integrate this simple feature for five stars.",
Really great app is very useful and easy to use. It gives me reminders if I don't finish something and I can set reminders for future things that I need to get done.,
Would be even better if there is an option to make multiple lists on the dashboard itself to make it even more convenient to use.,
I love how simple and yet powerful Todoist is. I recommend anyone at least try it the app and try the premium trail.,
Seems great but setting reminders is a premium feature... I'm not sure how a basic function of a list app can be a premium feature. Not worth it.,
Microsoft To-Do is WAYYYYY more user friendly and has tons more options. Including list sharing. Which I use multiple times per day.,
Best To do list app out there,
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.,
"Almost perfect! If there was the option to only share specific sections instead of entire projects, this app would be perfect.",
"Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks.",
"It's alright, nothing bad, not perfect. Can't give perfect score partially out of principle, but would give it 4.7/5.0 there are some minor complaints but they are minor nitpicks.",
Shared projects no longer sync among users. Their workaround of leaving and rejoining does not fix it. Without being able to sync this app is pointless.,
The right balance of simplicity and power for me and my partner. I love the quick entry method and Google calendar sync.,
Excellent tool for simple project planning. Lacks one feature that would make it 5*. Ability to add notes (usually form ideas before converting to tasks).,
I wish it would give me notifications on what I have to do,
Very very very very very very verrrrrrrryyyyyyyy baaaaadddddd apppppp üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,
Please add a student discount,
Recurring reminders removed?!,
wish I could enter a to-do easily without having a specific date assigned to it automatically! otherwise the app is slick and very useful.,
Excellent and very straightforward and easy to use especially now Boards (kanban-style) are here. As I am very spatially-oriented this is ideal for me.,
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.,
"Nice app, would be better if I can see the tasks that I've completed. I know it's in the paid function but it's too much of an important function that we are missing out on.",
"Having the ability to put my tasks in regular sentences and having todoist understand when and what I'm trying to remember is so well done I haven't used Google assistant for reminders in weeks, I also love the widget the app has built in",
Does not integrate well between all applications. The interface w/ outlook is horrible. Ability to set up task groups for shared tasks lists is lacking.,
Worst most useless app I've had the misfortune to try. Literally zero point in having this over Google calendar. Don't waste your space. It's useless. You can't have recurring tasks& everything is behind a pay wall. Avoid.,
"Great app but setting the times and dates in dutch doesn't always work very well, for example if you type 'half 3' it thinks you mean 3:30 while it's actually 2:30.",
"Very customizable planner, easy to navigate, but not basic. I love it. Thanks to the creators, you guys really did a nice job.",
Makes managing your to do list on the go quick and easy. Excellent feature parity with the web and desktop versions too!,
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part .",
Love that we can share work on a project and assign and schedule tasks and subtasks. Each person sharing the list can see when items are checked off. Very useful.,
Used Todoist for years now and it is essential to manage my busy life. I list even the most mundane tasks. Never lets me forget. So reliable! Wonderful!,
It'd be 100% if it would notify me of my list on the day at a specified time. I believe I seen this option but you have to pay. That does not make it a free app after all. Other than that its a decent app.,
I've tried many different apps and this is the one the has worked for me! So simple but very powerful and love that it works seamlessly between my phone and desktop.,
Can sync with Mac and Android but very Disappointed with this app. alarm/ reminder does not function. This should be included. Have to pay for it to function.,
"Best app for keeping track of clients, jobs and bills. Looked a long time for something like this. It's great for tasks too",
"First google result described todoist as a great free reminder app. They failed to mention you have to pay a yearly fee to receive any reminder notifications. Which IMHO, is absurd",
It's really useful to be able to write down tasks and reminders in my phone. Todoist is good for keeping it organized.,
love this app! I have used so many task apps in the past and none compare to this one. its easy to add things to yet keeps everything so organized and easy to find.,
"I love this app a lot. You can organize your short term and long term goals, and set their dates, whether they're a one time thing or something you do weekly or yearly.",
"Fantastic free features, good multi platform support. For a free app for me to get started with planning, I really can't complain.",
"Very useful, the paid version is worth every penny if you like to keep your lists organized and across multiple devices.",
"This app is great for managing tasks in a hectic schedule. It also keeps a log of the time and date each time was completed, this is great to check how you are managing your time! Definitely check it out!",
"Was initially sad that Wunderlist got shut down, but so happy to have discovered Todoist instead. I like it even better -- it is smart but also simple and not overwhelming. Wonderfully designed.",
opened up the review box while i was trying to check off some stuff. go away,
"work for a while then stopped syncing fixed it then it stopped working. same thing happens a third time. researched the problem. turns out ALOT of people had rhe same problem. they switched to any.do, so did i.",
A blip after recent update but now loving it again.,
A great app but the subscription based fee for all functionality is not good value and prevents many from committing. A one off cost would be much better.,
I have used to do list managers both paper and software for almost 40 years. I have researched ad nauseam. This is simply the best I've ever used.,
Really helps me to keep on top of my uni work! The ability to add projects and colour code really helps and using it on all my devices means i can always stay on track.,
"Linked across all my devices, and categorized into projects and tasks and can categorize priorities by colour and with reminders linked to my calendar. Great for productivity. Top app",
Super intuitive and simple to use. Good widgets. Actually increases productivity rather than frustration because it works.,
It's one of the first times when a free options has almost everything I need. It has a clear and pleasantly looking design.,
"Exactly what I needed...easy to use, non invasive reminders, simple to make changes as needed. I am an older person and the help this gives me is great!",
I love Todoist! It is an essential tool that keeps me organized while on the go. Simple and intuitive. I've recommended it to family and friends.,
Really enjoying this so far. Easy to use and helps me keep track of what I need to do. I work for myself and have lots of things on my plate so getting things out of my head and onto the app helps with that horrible feeling of overwhelm.,
"This app helps me manage the many things I have to accomplish in a day. The interface is simple and clean. It's easy to use, not too many bells and whistles, but enough features for day to day use.",
"Good app, just wish you were able to back date a completed task so I can use it for tracking habits as well, but it's a to do list app and works well.",
"Love this app. Makes life so much easier to keep organised, especially being able to sync across several platforms.",
"great for dumping all the tasks on my mind into one place, then i can easily drag them in order of the easiest ones first, and then blast through the tasks one by one.",
"Awesome organization tool, simply the best!! I had always struggle with sorting and rescheduling tasks, which in this app is done with ease A+ I truly recommend you give it a try",
My task manager of choice both personally and professionally. It's feature packed and provides timely reminders to ensure I'm staying on task.,
Just started using it....the interface is easy to learn and the amount of detail is just robust enough to be appropriate for what I do.,
Please add an option to delete all completed tasks together. Although we can hide deleted tasks but its better to permanently deleting completed tasks after some time and then using the hide feature as a recycle bin. Other than this It is a great app.,
"This has become a part of my daily routine. Can be used across devices like phone, laptops, desktops with auto sync. Also can arrange tasks in personalised groups.",
No reminder options for free version of this app. How can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for. My alarm clock would be better than this app. Sorry I don't recommend.,
Paid experience is better than free. But it will do since there are no ads. UI and design can be made note clutter free.,
Widget constantly breaking. Not updating and showing a loading icon at bottom. Defeats the entire point of having a widget easily viewable.,
"so easy to make custom recurring tasks, assign categories to them, add alerts, add notes, assign priority levels, etc. the premium version is totally worth it!",
I love this app and I haven't fully explored all of its abilities. It has kept me on point with a few things.... and I love the reminder function.,
A great tool for someone who want to boost up his productivity! Everything that I need from a todo list application is already implemented. I would definately recommend trying it out!,
"Very helpful and easy to use while being user friendly but not overly simple. Perfect for lists, projects, calendar reminder and simple side notes.",
"It's nice to set mini goals, complete the various tasks and check off those boxes. It's easy to use and convenient.",
I'm using the free version and it's fantastic. A great way to hold myself accountable and organize my tasks. I might even pay for the premium version!,
"In the parlance of our time, this is the G.O.A.T. to do list app. Especially for Android. Especially if yoy use Outlook for work. 12/10 would to doist again.",
"Reinstalled, still have incorrect list updates compared to my gf, which then results in incorrect groceries every freaking time. This after months. Time to find an alternative app now.",
Loved it! The best part is to be able to sync on phone and pc. Pretty easy to use and amazing UI.,
"Absolutely incredible. Thank you so much for creating this app. Its helped me progress foward each day with my work, my podcast, my 5k jogging goal and most importantly raising my son. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work",
"The best to do app, the repeat task after a certain time period is my favourite and a unique feature that lacked in all todo apps i have tried. Kudos to team Todoist",
I really like this app. It usually works flawlessly. But yesterday sincyng with Google calendar simply stopped working for no apparent reason. That was one of my favorite features and now it's gone.,
One of the simplest to do app which could be practically put in use out of so many organizer apps gone through myself. Would have given 5 stars but simply an alarm demands a lot of money from you.,
It does a beautiful job at helping you use their app through their website and other tutorials. It makes you soooo much more likely to stick to using it than other apps.,
"Simple, easy to use. The goal setting option is really helpful. It encourages you to stick to your plan and to do your tasks.",
"Hands down ths best task app. i used many and stuck with Todoist. The app is not without draw backs, frustrating sub task management and start date work arounds.",
Wanna love this all BUT it's half ruined bc they force all Overdue tasks to the forefront at all times. Overwhelming! I keep acting avoidant towards the app bc of that which defeats the purpose. Cant turn it off,
love it! I have way too many to-dog's on my list and it's easy to reschedule them at the end of a due date. also like being able to break down by project and priority.Yes,
"This app is really helpful. Earlier,I thought that to do list apps were useless and were a total waste of time. But this app is a real time saver. The reason is that earlier I had to think what I have to do and need to do in my mind, but now I can write in my to do list and get stress free",
Widget working again (not refheshing constantly),
"Hi,  I am using Vivo V5 Plus handset. I had downloaded ""Todoist"" for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work, if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen.  Kindly help me in this regard.",
Tried and loved Any.Do until they billed we without giving me notice or me even signing up for a paid plan. I'm glad it happened though because it allowed me to discover Todoist which is a much better and more complete app.,
Generally good app.I've been using it for a year now. It would be great if they could have a calender view of activities and a promodo timer.,
"Absolutely brilliant for keeping tabs on your tasks and timelines! Great Project Management tool, plus it motivates you daily as well.",
"Please ad an option to turn off check boxes on the widget. Since it was added, I'm constantly checking off items by mistske. Once you do this, it is tedious to get the item back.",
It's very easy to accidentally complete tasks and the only way to undo an accidental completion is behind a pay wall. Instant one star,
The app became unusable recently. When moving and changing the tasks the ui won't update. This service workout a reliable app is useless.,
"This is the first result when you search for ""reminder"" apps. ""Reminder"" is in the name. However, to give yourself an alert is a premium feature. Hard pass.",
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated",
"Excellent, very useful with a smooth powerful and intuitive interface. It's a must to keep my daily tasks on track",
"So far I can't complain. It's been reliable, helped me keep focus on my daily goals and the feeling of accomplishment from closing all tasks is truly something. Keep up the good work.",
this is a great app to keep me organized. I can access it on my phone or tablet. recent updates have improved the flexibility to reschedule tasks.,
Great! Was super easy to import my lists from Wunderlist and a bonus to have 2 months of premium. Seems rich in features and I like the design.,
"Replacing Franklin planner, so far so good. Still need my Google calendar to look more than 7 days out. May have to upgrade to access reminders.",
Love it. I'm actually getting things done! It takes a little bit of learning to work out how to make recurring tasks etc but once you do it's all there. (Free version),
"everytime the app gets update, i receive ALL PREVIOUS NOTIFICATIONS.  // Edit: I am sorry, but, I do not have time for that. I am using lenovo P2, it happens every single update. I have just had it again and app is no longer on my phone.",
"Pretty straight forward apps, it just make a list of the thing you have to take care. Simple, not too fancy, or complicated.",
"This app is amazing! It looks so simple, but at the same time it has so many features that makes things easier to plan. Definitely love it! If you're trying to organize your life, this app is the answer üòé",
Great free experience! I can organize my to-do lists into projects with subtasks. It's almost like a sprint board for my life.,
"Best task manager I've used, only thing I'd like to see is moving the sorting on the widget to a drop down in the top bar, rather then it taking up space where the tasks show up.",
Simple. Clear. Unobstrusive. But alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view.,
"Never uninstalled an app so fast. There is zero point to this app without reminders which you cannot do without a pro subscription. You need to pay 4 dollars a month to get a notification, what a joke.",
Very easy to use. Includes helpful widgets which let you easily add new tasks and see which ones you still need to finish.,
"Great gtd implementation. the are a few keyboard shortcuts that don't work as expected on the web version. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars!",
great and easy to use for both day to day tasks and long term things. This app has got me back on track and more productive. also a great feeling of accomlishment with all you get done.,
This app works very well. Adding new tasks are easy and it syncs seemlessly between devices. Can highly recommended it.,
"I've actually used this app for a long time off and on. it has some great features, some of which are premium. But even the free app is one of the best todo list apps around.",
Absolutely amazing app and seriously have nothing bad to say. I wish that we can get more perks as we use the app and its features more to encourage us to mange our time wisely,
"Reminders and notifications should always be there with the free version, can't think about a to-do app without those basic features.",
"The some part of the app is glitched and the completion sound plays randomly throughout the day. Edit, reinstalling fixed it.",
"I really appreciate the ability to schedule recurring tasks, reschedule easily, prioritize tasks, and easily identify the due date with abbreviations like ""every sat"".",
It is strange that I'm no longer able to share text/link from other apps to create a new task. Please investigate. Edited 27Aug: This has been fixed. Thank you!,
"It's a useful app but I wish their was a way to actually see the calender, or to like see the dates you have stuff on with out having to like check them off. Other then that it comes in handy.",
"This is the better app to organized my personal issues and professional work. Simple, easy to use and amazing features to keep me organized.",
"My Favorite Productivity Tool! I don't know how I would capture and accomplish all the tasks life throws at me without Todoist. Coming up on 2 yrs of premium subscription, worth every penny to me!",
"Works great and the price is right! I started using it with IFTTT and Evernote, and have almost dropped Evernote. This does what I need without the extra stuff.",
"It has everything that it claims but I do not think that this app is for my own needs. I uninstalled the app a while ago but now, now I have frequent emails from the developers and has become rather irritating. Is there anyway you can stop these emails?",
"this is a really great app for organizing thoughts, projects, and other needed things. easy to use and really visually appealing.",
Super handy. I use it all the time. The free version is great but i can imagine you might want to pay for bonuses like reminders,
"A decent app that helps a lot. I can see and check off what I need to do, and what I have completed. It helps me plan projects in advance with more detailed lists.",
"Only about every day reminder i rate 5 stars. Other apps can't cause Android powersave system. This app has a trick or something, and it keeps me remind. Thank you!",
"Starting grad school on top of working a part time job, balancing writing a novel and hosting a bimonthly podcast, rock climbing, and trying to maintain a social life, and also just household chores. Can't imagine what i would do with out this app.",
"Great app. Decent interface. However, some features are available only for premium user. Though overall its great :)",
I've been looking for something I can use for recurring daily tasks and the ease of use in Todoist is great. It's helped a ton with my daily organizational needs.,
"Just discovered the section header function so the app finally makes sense to me! would be good to have a daily summary in the morning and then a ""catch up"" notification in the afternoon to remind you to tick off tasks",
I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom. SOLVED,
I am not an organized person. I bought this to help remedy the situation. Has it solved all my problems? I don't think an app can do that. But it definitely makes me *feel* organized and on top of things so I'll give it 5 stars for that!,
it's a good app that helps you to organize and priorities and schedule your tasks plus some other cool features but you have to have the premium version.,
Probably can do a lot more than I'm using it for but finding it very useful to compose my daily to do list for work. Easy to change order of tasks which I like.,
"Overall a good experience. I think the price is too much for what they are offering, but it is by no means a bad product. Since it was too much I asked for a refund and they did it with no hesitation. My regards to the Todoist team",
"Can't add new tasks on mobile app anymore. Not sure if the app had a bad update or what, but now when I hit the +Add New Task button on the android app it just looks like I'm clicking it but the new task window doesn't show up and no keyboard shows up. I can only add tasks through desktop version on my computer. Please fix. I already tried uninstall and reinstall",
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.,
This is my new favorite to do list app! It's got everything I need and want. my favorite part is that I can prioritize and schedule tasks and it integrates into my calendar.,
"The easiest, most intuitive way to get organized ever. I was obsessed on day 1 and had my team onboard by day 2. Total lifesaver.",
"Just works. The UI is sometimes a bit crowded, but nothing serious. I use it for planning and scheduling daily routine.",
Would be 5 stars for sure except I can't add a task to the top of the list. It is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift. And they do know about the idea per the forums. Love everything else.,
Great app for staying organized and creating to-do lists. Must have for those that like to keep track of project tasks or just everyday life tasks.,
"I love it, the widget is great for the basics of writing new tasks and marking completed ones. The best to do list app I've tried. 10/10 would recommend",
"I can't see anything in my projects list at all after the update, and my app has become laggy. Edit: Updated the app and the issue has been fixed. Thanks for the prompt response Todoist team!",
"Great app!! This is what I have been looking for. A more organized and featured setup with a traditional ""outline"" type of foundation. Great work IMO....",
"I tried other todo apps, but this is the best one. It is much easier to use and all my todos synced between my devices. And I can invite my fellows to join my todo list.",
App works great and is a powerful add on to the website. Data always stays synced between two unlike some other apps ive tried.,
Great productivity tool. Simple to set up and use with good options for organising. The Premium option is very good value,
"Perfect app, but sometimes there is a bug when reordering tasks. Tasks ""reorder"", but then, they get back in the same order.",
The best task list. Tried other task apps and this is the most intuitive and reliable. Well worth upgrading to the paid version.,
"yes, another todo list. what is so good? there are templates for projects and tasks, and there is a theoretical base on the concept of productivity.",
"It'll be very useful if we could see the tasks we've completed, rather than it disappearing tbh, other than that, the app is grat. Kudos!",
"Simple, elegant and extremely useful. I especially liked the priorities you can assign (I was looking for an app where I could classify tasks by urgency and importance and this works)",
Really good experience so far. Only improvement I could see would be if there was a very quick way to add a task from the lock screen.,
The widget doesn't work seemlessly. I would have to open todoist once daily and wait for a few seconds to sync the same in my widget,
"The old interface was better (where the menu button was on the top left corner, and would appear with a right swipe) the new interface sucks!!",
"It was a nice app But something really got on my nerve , constantly there was a sound of a notification that really was irritating me , even i turned of notification of this app and every single sound of it , it didn't stopped and i had to uninstall it.",
"Great for productivity if you are easily distracted! As I've downloaded the app and started using it with Chrome's Pomodoro extension, my productivity has risen enormously. I really can't believe it!",
Very user friendly. Easy to add and revise items. LOVE the reminders and notifications. That is critical for me.,
"Great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes. Premium isnt necessary, only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once",
Best feature is that you can clear the notification and if they are overdue take it will come back the next day. will never understand apps that don't keep reminding you of undone tasks.,
"This app is the best I've tried.I have been using premium for 1 mo. and have purchased a year subscription.I'm glad I took the time to work out how to best use todoist for my specific work needs.It's taking some getting used to.My only complaint right now is with recurring tasks.Eg,if you have several tasks you need to accomplish every Monday,as you check them off,the next occurrence shows up on the list immediately.I'd prefer to clear my list and have the same tasks pop up the following Monday",
"After using Todoist for 3 months, I have considered it one of the most effective applications so far. I have planned pretty everything using this app and could not deny to say that it has made my life a lot easier!",
Useless for me because reordering doesn't work reliably. It messes up the tasks after dropping an item to a new location within the project.,
"I love todoist, I use the app and website and it's a life saver. I use it for my todo lists for my own business and even just the free plan offers so much. P.S 4 stars so I don't look like a robot, would rate 5 but god knows how many 5 star reviews are robots angnore.",
"Really Love the app, it helps me set my day and priorities straight... If you want an Evernote alternative, I would recommend this app. Edit: Even Better after adding the new features, you deserve a praise Dev's. I generally never hunt an app down on playstore to give an excellent review, but you made me worth it.",
Great App. I am able do all my daily stuff in one place. you need to pay to open some features like reminder but the free version has all I need for now. overall I'd highly recommend,
My current go-to app for to-do's. Intuative design and easy to use UI makes it simple to track my work and personal tasks.,
"Fantastic application. I love how you set deadlines, priorities and project by simply writing it in the task. Edit: the new board is really a great feature for project management",
"This is the to do app with the best features (or just the features I personally need). However, my recurring tasks keep disappearing, which is simply unacceptable behaviour for a to do app.",
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled.",
"Very functional way to keep important information in a easy to navigate app. Perfect digital tool to apply the concepts of ""Getting Things Done.""",
"Take the time to read about all the features and dive in... awesome tool that I would recommend highly. Way more than just a ""To Do"" list.",
"Only began using it but seems intuitive to use. Love that I have various lists, link to projects, share lists, assign tasks and gave due dates",
"After completing a task it should not disappear, like other apps it should move to the bottom of the list. Please create such a feature! Rest of the app is awesome!!",
"Very good, has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff. Haven't tried the collaboration part yet!",
"Please Add the following features: ‚Ä¢ Allow to group by ""project sections"" in filters ‚Ä¢ Allow board view for filters ‚Ä¢ List view to be decluttered and have columns for the different fields (similar to Asana) ‚Ä¢ Today and upcoming view to not only show tasks assigned to you, but ALL tasks ‚Ä¢ Change Add Task widget icon ‚Ä¢ Ability to change the color of the entire task box, based on priority (currently only the bullet changes color) ‚Ä¢Priority: ability to change colors, and to add more priority options",
Wonderful app! Keeps me focused and on task. It was hard to forget anything because it sent alerts and reminders via email. Definetely recommended.,
"Great app that keeps me able to manage my schedule. You'll find that once you start to develop time management skills, there is a lot of time leftover to use.",
"Getting things done. Though, i find that without a due date, some items easily fall through the cracks. Due dates are key.",
Just got a subscription and so far I'm loving it. The only thing I'd like to change so far is for it to be quicker adding a task from the smart watch app.,
"great app to organize both work and personal tasks. either for one time tasks or routines, todoist is the best system to keep track and remind me of my tasks and goals",
"Have tried any.do, wunderlist, Google keep, tasks, Evernote. This works the best for me especially since it allows syncing with calender.",
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.,
"Keeps spamming your email (even after you uninstall the app) with marketing emails. No, I don't want your app, I did not like it, I did not subscribe to you email subscriptions, get lost",
Great app! Too bad a lot of helpful features are for premium only. I'd like to have a calendar layout of the week.,
"Amazingly useful piece if software, enabled me to better organise i do from everyday tasks, food shopping and my personal life goals and projects. I recommend it to friends regularly.",
"I'm awful at keeping on track when i have a big project - whether involving school or a home project, I forget little tasks all the time. ToDoist is great at keeping track of the tasks and you can set up how much nagging you need.",
"Works as I want it to: easy to assign due dates and clear interface. Unfortunately my company has blocked web acces so I switched to MS To Do, which is quite worse without the board option",
Todoist enables me to plan my to-do list with schedules and time which is wonderful for time boxing of tasks... The new boards are wonderful love it greatly as it helps to see the progress of projects,
"Nice app, asy to use, wasn't keen on the email alerts, though I guess they were only doing their job and reminding me what I hadn't done! Easy to turn them off though and enjoying the app even more.",
very good but not as good as Wunderlist. it lacks the simplicity of the interaction. sub tasks for example are not as good implemented.,
"New widget only tells you have something on a particular day, but not what. Tbh, it's become pointless, taking up a large chunk of screen but not providing info at a glance. Now looking for an app that does what it says on the tin.",
Absolutely great to track your to-do-list. I strongly suggest everyone who wants to track their new year resolution to use this.,
"Awesome app! It's like having a spare brain, to remember all the stuff that I won't. Great interface, super intuitive. I like it!",
"It works great. It's simply with extra stuff that I may never use, but Im not in for the details. I needed an easy 'to do list' and Todolost does just that.",
Easy to Navigate with simple task input and completion of task. Sense of accomplishment. I like it so far.,
easy to use and navigate. also lots of options even without paying for the upgrade would definitely reccomend to others,
"Excellent App. Task input, auto recognition of time & dates, Rscheduling is easy. Tried at least 10 other apps but Todoist is best amongst all.",
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article üò°üò°üò°? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.,
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.,
amazing app! Im much better with keeping on track with my activities with it :) i would really like to request the feature of having a do-date and deadline though so i can plan when to do big tasks better,
"I have a running grocery list, reminders of personal and business tasks I want to do, all at my fingertips. I'm finding new uses for it daily.",
Needs an option to start/end the day at a different time then midnight. Also better options for repeating and expiring tasks.,
Generally it's pretty good. I wish the tasks that don't get done get flagged to come up as either notifications or emails so that you can act on them. Maybe they can automatically go to the next day as well,
A very powerful app and totally reliable. I especially like the Karma system (partly because of animeüòú) as it is very sophisticated and clean. All-in-all a pretty reliable method.,
"On free version can't even set a specify time for a task (can only set a date), nor set a reminder. What's the point of a to do list app without these functions? Uninstalled.",
I tried many apps to track my daily to do before settling on to-doist. This is a simple yet powerful app to track your work and progress. I love it and absolutely recommend it.,
"Enjoying writing daily tasks. The app is so easy to use, but haven‚Äôt used it to its full potential yet. Syncing across to my laptop, makes life easier too.",
No feedback. And I want to arrange the tasks according to their priorities in the home screen widget. And I want to repeat some tasks weekly.,
It helps me manage my time with such ease. I plan everything in the morning and then complete all the tasks till nighttime. This product is amazing!! Thank you!!,
I was struggling with keep a set schedule on things and remembering to do the things that I need to do. Thanks to this apps widget that I can put on my screen it helped a lot.,
Great tool for kepping me on track. The integrations was very important. I use multiple tools and when they all talk it makes things easy.,
I like that everything I need to do is right in one app with a reminder! Loving it! It also allows lists withing the list you are making.,
"This app literally helped me be a better person by being able to organize my life and get things done more efficiently. The Pro version is definitely worth the buy, too. Thanks, Todoist!",
"I like the app so far. One issue is like someone else said, why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14-day trial? Second, why don't the notifications pop up where I can see them? That was one of the main reasons that I got the app. I need to be constantly reminded of what I need to do. I have ADHD and remembering a bunch of things that I have to do is a HUGE issue.",
"5* scheduling app! Simple and intuitive. Convenient ""inbox"" to list tasks and categorise later. I am enjoying being more proud tive by using this app.",
It's UI is clean and easy to understand. It's feature of auto picking dates by writing the date directly is very good and innovative.,
"It's a todo list, no better than any other, at a great cost, which you can pay for one year up front. I'll use Keep, which does much more, for free.",
"This has been my favorite to do app for years, but suddenly the badge app has stopped working on my Note 10. If I don't quickly find a way to resolve this, I'll be looking for another list solution. üôÅ",
"Simple and easy to use. You can schedule events by typing something like ""every other thursday"" after the title and Todoist will automatically schedule it for you.",
"Putting things on the list as soon they pop in my head means I'm remembering to do so much more & having the daily target makes me do the tasks & more. Funny how ticking a box ""done"" can be so motivating. Todoist is fab",
"Perfectly simple, yet very customizable. This app sets out and does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is clear that the developers have had a genuine interest in making other people's lives better and more productive. Highly recommended.",
"Use it everyday, zero complaints and they're actually ahead of the curve as far as providing new features and functionality.",
"Perfect. Simple but effective - I like the calendar integration, calendar view, projects and subtasks.",
"This is a To Do app, yet something as simple as setting a reminder for a task is a PREMIUM feature you have to pay for. How pathetic. There are other BETTER apps available for free. Bye Bye.",
"Sends mails claiming monthly payments of $4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs $7 And also the app is quite crappy without premium, and premium at $4 would still be too expensive for what you get.",
"Don't do it. You have to sign up with your email, then you get emails Multiple times every day pushing you to sign up for the Pay version. Why would I want the ""Pro"" version when the app sucks?",
"Great app! I use it when I realize I am multitasking too much. Also, I created a list for packing and grocery list that I share with the household which is suoer helpful so we dont forget anything.",
Favorite to-do app. Easy to add and manage schedule. Get rewarded for doing so and keeping your productivity streak.,
"Syncs perfectly, very easy to use across all platforms so your tasks are alway at your fingertips be it phone, tablet, computer. Great product, reasonable price!!",
I am now becoming more on top of things with this app. The feature that aggregates your score is a huge boost in morale to make sure you are doing what you intend to do. This is such a great tool and I have recommended this to a few people I know. Thank you Todoist team for this :),
This app is truly awesome. very powerful integrations with all manner of platforms. really nice to have something like this. has reallly helped me to be more organized.,
"flexible tool to capture, organize, filter and manage changing priorities. Goes with me on mobile app and accessible on PC by web browser.",
"(Update:Any timeline to add this?)Hi Can you add secondary filter, like currently you provide filter option priority 1, priority 2 etc. When we r using a filtered view like ""View all"" then all task priority 1 (from different projects) gets lined up sequentially. Here if suppose 15 task have Priority 1, 30 have priority 2 then it is difficult to sort. Can you please add secondary priority filter like SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 etc which we can assign to task and then u know we can see proper sorted view.",
"This app sends an email out to remind you that you have overdue items on your list. if you have many tasks and can't keep track of what to do, you should try this app.",
"wish they had long-term thing, or weekly checklist that wasnt split up by days. besides that, it's great!",
"Best ""to do list"" apo I've ever seen. I tried many, and this one is the most powerful and easy to use. Important thing is that app is improving from day to day. Everything you may be dislike today, tomorrow can be fixed.",
"I wish the app would automatically disappear from the phone's background after assigning tasks. And, a repeat period from-to.",
"Awesome app, helps me keep track of everything I need to do. Best feature is the connection to Google Calendar which makes this just perfect!",
For someone with adult ADHD this app is life saving. Within two weeks my life is back to fully organized. The integration with Gmail and Google Calendar is excellent. I couldn't live without it.,
"So far Todoist (the free version) has been helpful. It has helped me organize, and figure out how to approach, different tasks.",
the one I've stuck with and paid for compared to all the rest. best balance of functionality and simplicity/usability.,
Love the app! Would be even better if you could set daily tasks that occur every day and have a sort of calendar. Thanks,
"I love this app! Helps me keep track of those things that I need to do, priority, and the time they need to be done. A great aid in my productivity along with a good note-taking app. Enjoy!",
Great app that keeps me on track for immediate and longterm goals. Plus it syncs with Google Calendar.,
easy to use! I wanted a to do app and this one fits the bill. not much of a learning curve and can adapt to how i want to use it.,
"love the app, love that it connects seamlessly to the computer version, so pleased that it connects well to other users even in the free version so my partner and i can share project lists.",
Cross platform and easy to use. Would like to be able to list all the tasks across the different projects though.,
I love the functionality and idea. I uninstalled because setting a reminder for a task should NOT be a premium feature.üòí My Google calendar does that as a standard so why have this?,
"Easy to use. I love the email reminders and the ability to add photos, emails, and comments to tasks!",
"I love this app. it let's you separate by category and cross things off as a whole task or even sub tasks. I have lists for every project, for my FT job, passion projects, and small business 100% recommend.",
"Not having push notifications (reminders for tasks) in the free version makes the app entirely worthless, and premium is far too expensive.",
Download it and then immediately uninstalled. Have to pay premium prices to get any features at all. Can't even set up reminders. Don't bother with this app.,
Been using this app for almost 4 years. Truly one of the best. Edit: I just need you to know how badly I've been waiting for Upcoming View! I can finally quit using other calendar apps for good!!!,
"This is a simple app and should not have any premium features and yet, one of the most important things about an online to-do list: a reminder notification, costs money.",
"Has been helpful for events, reminders, chores, and lists. I love that my husband and I can share projects. Easy to use!",
This app is really helpfull. I'm a third year student who have a full room of task. This app so remind me to do my schedule or paper deadline. Thx so much for this app. i love it.,
"Hugely helpful for tracking important tasks. Use in conjunction with something like Google Calendar to help spread work evenly across the coming weeks-- the ""find a day to do this task"" workflow is the only thing I find a bit lacking.",
"Made a list of things to do. Came back and the list was gone, but apparently I'd completed 7/5 tasks and had nothing left to do. Complete waste of time!",
"Nice app for tracking daily tasks. This is the free feature of app. Further, there are premium features in the app at additional cost, which I have not tried.",
"Like others have said. Before it was the best todo list app, but now it's painful to do even simple things. Specifically the additional pop-up window on mobile app is just horrible.",
"Easy and effective task management. I especially like the home screen widget which allows me to view tasks by project, due date, and next 7 days.",
"This is beyond helpful when planning out my day. I use this for both school and personal projects. It's aesthetic, organized, and simple to use. I'm in love with Todoist! üíõ",
It's as if this app was designed specifically for me. Really helped me organise and de-clutter my schedule. Thankd for such a wonderful app. keep up the nice work,
"App is great and all. Only one problem though, the shortcut on my homescreen always went missing after i put it. I am using a custom launcer and idk what happened, please fix this, thank you ^^",
It's very versatile; the project system makes it easy to group tasks together. The one problem is that it doesn't have a calendar view.,
Everything is fine.Few things are needed to be added at must to make this app awesome for five stars. 1. Milestone for each Project. 2. Weekly Calenders 3. Dashboard Please add these featuresm I would love to buy a premium if i would get these. Thanks.,
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money,
I have ADHD and this app has been amazing. It has helped me stay focused on my projects and the seamless use between mobile and desktop is amazing.,
It's really helps me to track things that I need to do in my everyday life and it's really helpful to me I didn't know about this until I was going through play store and I saw this and I thought to myself that instead of just writing it down on the paper you have a whole app that you can use to just truck things that are important to you like conferences things that you want to do something that you want to do special for somebody's birthday or something like that.....,
"Instead of tasks simply disappearing from the list when done, please add the option to do a strikethrough. It'll feel way more satisfying.",
I love it. I tried so many to do apps in playstore and this is one of the top 3 for me! Please add calendar view and this will be perfect.,
"This is so beautiful app, im starting I used to use, but I liked apple's reminder app. But after as this app updated and I started using again and explored features, so cool. So useful. This app helped a lot. I totally recommend it and explore features and widgets.",
One week in. Has definitely kept me on task. I recommend easing into it and break down your goals in managble bite sized tasks. Sub task option is a great tool for that.,
"Simple yet powerful, no ads even in basic version, seamlessly connects to multiple accounts & devices, I use it everyday for reminders & task.",
"Very helpful! It's actually helped me to be in track with my work. But the only drawback would be that the other features that you want to use, you'll have to pay for those. But even without that, it's a good app.",
"Easily the best of the best.. already years using these kind of tools yo manage my business, family, tasks all of it!! And this is by far the best of the best and absolutely fabulous.. just remarkable!! Very helpful.. thank you soo much for my making our lives easier.",
VERY HANDY. Using the free version for personal and business task management. Very handy. Everything I need except access to task history.,
Want a better navigation across projects (hamburger menu is too crumsy). But overall I like this app and the service overall.,
Easy to use and reliable. Apps for just about every platform. I appreciate that they publish a real changelog with updates.,
its really helped me to feel less overwhelmed trying to remember everything i have to do. The goals and karma also appeal to my competitive side.,
"Good, it would be great if I could link it to other apps. Perhaps put the lists on a calendar like in outlook",
Good Reminder. has made life easy.. less to remember ..easy to take out in groceries shop..and buy as per the list ..have shared with wife..she adds items to it..while coming from office ...make purchase..from the list..just add some colour to the base ..,
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36‚Ç¨ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan,
Recurring task doesnt show in the following week until you tick off the task from this week. whyyyy? deleted as i can't use this to plan. UI looks great otherwise.,
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.,
Downloaded the app and added a bunch of items and a couple of categories. Opened it back up a few hours later and everything is gone.,
"This is a literal Godsend. It has helped me finally feel in control of my time and actions. It's helping with my mental health, a lot. I'm using it with David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"", and it is helping me make an awesome change in my life.",
"For the widget, please add the option for larger font size. I like to set the compact mode to prevent accidental ticks, but then each Todo becomes very small. Larger font will help with this case.",
"Best app for GTD workflow. But I use it for a lot more than that. It can be used as a list management system for notes, todos, etc.",
Todoist helps me get things accomplished. It helps me plan my work and home life. Its a tool that can be effective in the hands of beginners if you simply read their helpful tips and tricks.,
"Great app for organizing my tasks. my favorite feature was ""inboxing"" tasks that I wanted to do at some point but not schedule it yet.",
"I truly enjoy this app! While I am still getting used to it, I love that it provides a place for me to get my thoughts and to-do items out of my head and onto paper. Highly recommended for folks who struggle with organization.",
Straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop. Sometimes I get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects.,
It's good but not perfect because I have same tasks everyday and the tasks I kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason I am switching to ticktick,
Changed the program so you can't list all tasks unless you upgrade to premium. Looking for a new do list app.,
"I've been using Todoist for several years. It isn't magic. It takes work to keep up with it. However, as a TODO manager, it works very well and has lots of very nice features",
"If you use Gmail, calendar go with Google tasks free with much more functions and integrated with your calendar events, reminder, tasks without subscription. Stick with the big guys! Waste of time with this app.",
I love todoist. It's definitely asking my top 5 apps. I love that there is a Google Chrome extension. It helps keep me in track and beats hand written post-it note reminders!,
I really like how easy it is to schedule and reschedule tasks and it has been very helpful in making sure I have all my work in place for online learning.,
Todoist is amazing! It has really helped me be more organized and productive. Their point system is also fun.,
"this app is extremely easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. as someone who is very forgetful and disorganised, this app really helped me get my life back in order. definitely reccomend",
Best App I've tried (for this purpose) and I stopped trying others until further notice. I'm considering paying for the fancy things since the app is so smooth and it's cheap enough.,
One of the best To-Do (L)ist apps I've ever come across. Superb UI. Customer care was super quick when I faced a problem. Really appreciate the developers for this app!,
"Todoist keeps me on track, and I have a lot going on. The thing I like best is how it works across platforms, and they made sure the Android version works well.",
This app is so amazingly done and so helpful. I can't begin to describe how much value this app has to me. This app make a huge difference in my life by allowing me to build habits and be consistent with them!!,
"I accidently deleted an item then screen rotated and Undo option did not appear! Developers, please preserve state of the app between rotations!",
"I use it as a shared grocery list tool. I was looking for one that didn't require access to my contacts and which you could simply add ""pb"" rather than ""Kroger creamy peanut butter 14 oz.""",
not quite as good as Wunderlist for me... but overall decent and as I need to use this for work now (as wunderlist blocked!) I am trying to get into it broadly. premium features seem quite pricey.,
"Very Good app, if you're interested in a easy and very functional solution to plan out days ( like I do, or just for any type of task list. This is my #1 go to",
"The daily calm has helped me ""finally"" to consistently Meditate and now that I've established the habit I'm exploring the many other choices Calm offers to advance my mindfulness practice. I'm sleeping better and more relaxed. Well done!",
"Uncomfortable manual typing for time setting in a reminder. Time reminders are not stable, some times push notifications doesn't work.",
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} ü§î. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.,
"Love this app its my number recommend todoist app they have some useful template you can itch and the UI is to elegant so you can feel more comfortable on it, I still look for one option is that promo timer hope they came with this in the future",
"Todoist helpse for work, for my life to organize my regular and irregular tasks I use it to remember things and communicate with my team simple to master yet such an efficient tool cross platforms and dedicated to help people Thanks !",
"Definitely the best app out there for syncing honey-do lists, especially if your life is complicated.",
A really well-designed app with an intuitive interface that has helped me declutter my thoughts and prioritize.,
One of my all time favorite apps! You can easily collaborate with your teammates as well as friends. The Karma option keeps you on the track and forces you to complete your task daily.,
Best app for task management. The integration with Google calendar is a great feature. Smart detection of text is awesome!,
"I love using this app. However, the incessant pop up survey asking ""Do you love Todoist"" and ask you to rate it in Play Store makes the app feel like an insecure partner constantly nagging you for validation. 5 star otherwise.",
"switched from Toodledo, never looked back. comments ate awesome because you can attach files. assigning tasks to projects is also much easier",
This app is great for getting all tasks done. I have had it for a few days now but am finding it great. The one thing I think this app could improve on is when you get your tasks or put your tasks in you should be able to put a time that it will pop up on your screen so you can tell if you should have done it in that time. As I said this is a great app and I recommend it to everyone that needs an app to get everything done you need to get done in a day. Thank you for this app it is great. Xx,
"It's a pretty useful app. I just started using the premium version, I will see how it works. But the free version should be enough for many people tough.",
I am using the premium version. I find that the app works well for basic task keeping as well as repeating tasks.,
"Pretty good free features. Simple to use and easy to see and stay organized, especially with the widget on the home screen you can easily see your list of tasks for the day",
"Good and I like it but notifications are only in paid version, but I like that I can link it to my calendar, but I have to take another step to add notifications to the calendar, and I wish when I marked a task as completed it would remove it from my calendar, but it doesn't. Other than that I like it.",
Very useful app. It really helps you schedule your day and the days ahead very very effectively. Once you figure it out how to apply it to your day you will never leave this app!,
"Really amazing! It helps people achieve your tasks... Better than using a ""piece of paper"". Inclusive you can fix commitments in future days.",
New to it. But seems to be very easy to use. I haven't found something I want it to do yet that is hasn't got. I especially like the gmail integration even though its limited on that side.,
Best task app ever. I always enjoy widgets and this is the only app I found that has one. The reminders are great and the UI is easy to use,
"Good design but when you uncheck items on a list it doesn't put them back into their original order, making it pretty much useless.",
I'm probably not using it to it's fullest potential but it works for what I needed. The main thing I needed was for unfinished tasks to automatically roll over to the next day. Most apps don't do that.,
This app is amazing for students and it allows me to keep track of all my assignments and it helps me make sure that the assignments are never late.,
"Best to do App ever! I am a Supervisor at the company I work for and require my staff to use this app. If you can make a way for a group to access one app and one person to manage the task in that group...fire! I believe in you, make it happen!!!!",
very simple and intuitive interface. love hiw you can set dates and projects by just typing it next to the todo.,
"reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great üôÑ",
"Great productivity app! Tried Wunderlist, Asana, trello- not for me. Todoist is simple and clean + the 2way gcal integration is something I can't live without anymore. Thought about switching to notion but for now todoist is my dawg",
"Great, clutter free, to the point app with enough features (if you think it doesn't exist, Google it! There's many hidden things you need to know!)",
Very good way to stay organized. The subtasks and subprojects are helpful. Reminders and due dates too.,
Works well. No crashes or sync errors so far. Intuitive to use. Dark mode option is much appreciated.,
"Works great and keeps me on track! Wish a few more options were free, but I can work around them well enough.",
works great for me style of task organizing. it is fairly adaptable so you can make it what you want. i highly highly highly recommend this.,
Awesome app. Been using a few years. Love syncing between all my devices. Really helps me to stay organized and more productive.,
"Reliable, easy to use, and well-maintained. I use google tasks and google keep also, but i find that this app helps me manage my to-dos in such a way that makes it indisposable, even as a user of those other services",
"Update: thanks but still doesn't help - could it be phone? On Huawei mate 10. First review: Coming from wunderlist, main use shared shopping and admin lists with family, so have shopping project with sub project for each shop. I made the Shopping project the home screen, but can't see any sub projects and their tasks on Android! Can on Mac. Investigating Sections. So multiple taps hunting for undated tasks. Too complex for family, frustrating for me. OK otherwise.",
Saved myself way too many times when I forgot events and deadlines were about to be due because of a hectic work and school balance. Highly recommended for anybody especially going into medical school,
"I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further.",
"The paid upgrades have everything I want in a to-do app! Primary of which is lots of customization with due dates, reoccurance, and reminders.",
Somewhat complicated to start off with. If you can get past the steep learning curve initially it is the best out there.,
I've tried a couple different apps for making to-do lists and this is easily the winner. Amazing design and usability,
"I love the app BUT the new update has brought this glitch where you can't add tasks to projects by clicking on "" add task"". It doesn't work, instead you have to click on the three dots then click add task",
"Its the best 'to do list' app I've ever come across by first impressions, simple and easy to use, looking forward to using it this week to get rid of my admin!",
The best todo app. Sync with external calendar is very fast and reliable (with 2 way modifications).,
Pretty easy system for making a checklist. Also the fact you can share lists with folks is especially nice.,
Do you want a glorified piece of paper? Here's the perfect app for you. If you thought this app would give notification reminders to do something you have to buy it. A 30 second code cash grab is all this app is.,
"Very handy. The paid feature handling is annoying, those should be disabled (grey) rather than trigger a dialog soliciting purchase ok/cancel. Five otherwise.",
I keep on forgetting to open it and tick off my tasks. They should like send more notifications but not spamming. Otherwise this is an amazing app!,
this app is so amazing... the UX is so simple and u have alot of options to adjust to your task.. syncing with web app and desktop apps. that's my daily task planning app ‚ô•Ô∏è,
The app does everything I need it to do. And I've been looking for an app like this for about 2 years. Big fan of the optiin to make tasks recurring!,
"Having used many ways to be productive in my time, todoist has been my go to todo list for over 4 years now, which I use along side google docs for wordy notes. Well worth the annual cost to get lables, notes etc",
"Todoist has a lot of nice features but it does not include a Start Date, only a Due Date, which makes it difficult for me to use.",
"Using the free version, very pleased so far. Voice ability very useful and mostly accurate.",
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick.",
"In the pricing it states the free version has use of up to 80 projects, but the software cut Me off at 5 projects, rendering it useless to Me. Response ti Devloper response, I sent an e-mail to the contact address right after you responded, and still have not gotten a response to My e-mail .... sad",
"The wear os app does not synchronize correctly with the phone, nor do the widgets synchronize correctly. Once this is fixed it is back to 5 stars.",
Its really good. But is there a way to create a task which repeats itself after certain period of time say every monday just like Google calendar,
It wouldn't let me authinticate a sign in. I tried with using Google to sign in & the screen darkens but does nothing. I tried using email & it kept spinning. I tried with Facebook & it said I logged in but then did nothing. Installed because what good is it if it's not going to let me use it?,
So far Todoist has helped me maintain and complete tasks that would otherwise be missed. Easy to use and reliable.,
So efficient and easy to use. i love having my list everywhere no matter what device. I love being able to add items on particular days.,
"Really great app, but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature: notifications for a timed reminder.",
This is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing. You pay not good at all With free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app,
"Hamstringed app that just tried to get you to spend $36 for timed reminders etc. Just use Any.do or any other task app, and you can get all of this apps functionality for much cheaper. SCAM!",
"Wow, this is so slick. Has to be the most polished app I have ever used. Not really surprised as the web, Windows and iOS are all superb as well. This is so worth the $4 a month.",
"I am one of the oldest todoist user and this app has sorted my life like anything, kudos to you guys for creating such a useful app. I would urge to just add one more feature which shows the month view.",
"Excellent todo list app for personal use. smart text interpretation, reminders, sub projects, it has everything.",
"Neat, easy to use and a clean design. Would have been the best if the activity log wasn't a premium feature.",
Spent 5 minutes trying to create a recurring task and failed. Setting up a reminder for a task is a premium feature? Seriously?,
"Pretty much all my ""life"" schedule is organized by todoist. Happy to pay for premium package as well, very much worth it whether you are a professional or a student and so on, so on. Recommend!",
"Thank you for letting me know, I will take a look to try it again, and update my review at that time ------ Looking to set reminders, but alarms are only on premium feature so I can't even confirm if this app can do what I need it to do before purchasing.",
It has been a great tool for keeping track of whats due in all my classes. It also helps me to plan my weekly schedule better.,
Keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project. This app will definitely help you in all the ways it can. Great for increasing productivity.,
After Wunderlist was bought out I had chose this app as the next big todo list app. It offers the most integrations and advanced functionality than any of its competitors.,
Not sure what happened with the redesign. None of my tasks are visible in the projects or inbox. Unusable right now.. Edit issue fixed by dev,
I have been using it for about a week and it has honestly helped me keep me priorities straight for stuff like school work. If you having hard time deciphering which thing to tackel first or just want a to do list I recommend this app,
Reminders require Premium. I only have the free version for now. I'd like to have it on my phone too but apparently it isn't compatible with my phone. Not sure why.,
Great app with no ads disrupting experience. You can share tasks with other people and has lots of customizable options.,
I really like having the 7 Day widget on my homescreen. Helps me to keep important to dos on my radar eg. Was gonna rate it 4 stars at first bc some of the stuff is paid for but then again they gotta make a living somehow...,
"Easy to use, helps me note things quickly, works across my devices. Has a nifty widget too. Still using the free version and loving it so far.",
"And app requiring my email address just to see what it offers gets an automatic one-star review and deleted from my phone. If you want to make money of my PII, I want to see what I'm getting in return first.",
Very good app. Some features are non-intuitive which reduces the rating by a star. Otherwise very good.,
Seems great so far. If you add an option to make the widget clear or transparent I'll give you money for premium. *edit- they literally added this for me in less than a week,
Sayonara Wunderlist. I used it for a year and didn't know what I was missing. Know all those Wunderlist features that you've been Googling that only come up in forums as user suggested features? Todoist has them.,
This app has been worth the equivalent of thousands of dollars to me in saved time and productivity since I started using it four years ago. It's one of my favorite apps I've ever found. I cant recommend it highly enough.,
"Don't bother unless you want to pay. A lot. There are free apps (or Post-it Notes) that do everything this does, much, much more inexpensively.",
The free option has all the features I need. An alarm would be nice but since I don't have the premium I'll do without for now.,
"So far, I'm just trying to move the constant cyclone of ""Did I take my vitamins?"" ""I need to call the dentist"" ""Let's learn Arabic for some reason, did we practice today?!"" out of my head and into an app, and this has worked fairly well for that. Plus Hannah Witton uses it and she rules, so good enough.",
"Very helpful and easy to use to help organise day to day tasks, even the free version has enough featurss to organise yourself efficiently.",
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.,
What kind of app doesn't support 2FA in 2021? Seriously todoist. People have voted for this feature and requested it numerous times. Shameful security practice. I love this app and I have found it useful but please add support for 2fa!,
"I use it for everything- grocery list, agendas, homework, etc! It's the best tool and I love that it can sync to my Google calander!",
Very easy to use and sub task feature is great. Would love a separate grocery list feature incorporated.,
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders,
"Everything is great, But it would be nice to have a habit tracking option or maybe something like daily planner.",
"My go-to app for checking off to-do lists. Simple, smooth and easy to operate. Highly recommend it to everyone üòÄüòäüòÄ",
"Great to do app I love being able to check off items as I do them. I also like the labels, filters, and projects (premium)",
"I've been using this app for a couple of years now, and I still love it. I use it instead of a calendar and to-do list. The only little thing I wish was different is that I'd like there to be a way to scroll further into the future than just 7 days (next 30 days maybe?).",
This simple app has transformed our business by allowing my boss and I to share a task list. Board view needs to make it to the Windows app though.,
Excelent tool. I use it every day. It has helped me to keep track of pending tasks that would normally get lost if I keep it only in my mind.,
"It's like a to do list, but broken up so it's less manageable. And who doesn't want an email every morning saying 'Here's everything you didn't accomplish yesterday.'",
The best organising app I have ever used. Very intuitive and very well designed. It has been a huge help.,
Excellent app with useful features to get stuff done! Thankfully not bloated with ads or useless features. Highly recommend!,
You have to pay to get simple feature like reminder. What a pathetic way to get paid subscribers. Company only care about money. I don't care about your fancy feature of subtasks or what not but reminder should be free feature.,
"You have to pay for alerts, which defeats the purpose. But it's simple and organized well. Good if you remember to check it.",
Used to be Any.do user for many years but getting buggy thus making the switch over & never look back. This app rocks in every ways.,
"I love this app so far. It has helped me maintain my focus during the day and remember what us important to me, rather than reacting to unscheduled interruptions that steal time.",
it works. but WAY TOO EXPENSE and compkicated than most user will need. this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating.,
"I love being able to empty my brain out in this app for all the stuff I need to get done, so I don't have to try and remember everything. I sleep much better at night with less worry!",
"Wish there was a little bit more flexibility for notes, etc. Overall great for a free app.",
Great app. I look forward to using it everyday. The only issue I have is it should have better integration with Google Home or Alexa.,
Satisfied with its user friendly options except that some basic features like reminders are unavailable in free version.,
"This app, along with Cave Days and the Freedom app, are helping to completely transform my relationship to my work and my ability to organize and implement projects and goals. I highly recommend it!",
This is a very well designed app. I especially love the ability to share lists with my wife and make comments back on forth on specific tasks.,
This app is super easy to use and very helpful for tracking tasks. Haven't used all the features yet but loving it so far!,
Helful and easy to use. Easy to transfer tasks to a new day. Not overly complicated interface.,
"Helps me keep everyhthing I have todo in one place since using it I haven't forget any task. Work, Personal and more work non stop todo lists with no stress.",
Why i couldn't add a widget where i can manage all the tasks I've scheduled for a week? The only widget that is available is the widget where it will help mo to directly open the app. Looks like the old version was more helpful.,
Why editing task is so difficult. Intuitively I long press to edit but no response. Then I have to figure out here and there to find how to edit.,
My favourite app! My life is so much more organised and easy now that i can add in anything and everything that needs yo to be done for the week or day in one place.,
After one week of using Todoist I have realized how many tasks i used to postpone. Both computer and phone app helped me with completing all of them and I will definitely recommend it to everybody from now on.,
Super app. One of features to add to basic version is type of calendar task distribution to visualise your week/month/year.,
App requires registration to start usage. Seriously!? I thought that email doesn't required for offline todo list. Why I need to register if I don't want to use optional online features?,
Still love Todoist. Works well all these years. It works well with no crashes or force closing. Works as it says on the tin Thanks Todoist team. üëçüèæ,
"This is more than a to-do app. It's part philosophy, grounded in solid time management and productivity principles. I believe that's what sets this app apart.",
Immediate uninstall and 1 star rating because you have to PAY FOR PREMIUM in order to access the REMINDER function - utter foolishness! The whole purpose of me looking for a To Do List app is so that I can be reminded of my daily tasks.,
Seems almost perfect. I'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks/assignments/etc.,
Really good app. Edit 9/15/21: Still not happy about the 5 projects limit but the technical team was responsive and bugs have been fixed quickly.,
Absolutely amazing app for helping you to organise projects at home and at work and actually get stuff done. Get it you won't regret it.,
This has become my go to task tool. it's multiplatform with a load of features but doesn't overwhelm you. fantastic natural language support for scheduling.,
It's a wonderful app. It's very easy to define the dates to be reminded which is unlike the traditional to-do apps.,
"Very helpful and convenient for forgetful, disorganized, or even well organized people -when I manage to check it that is...",
Extremely usefull application. You can use it on both pc and mobile with automatically updated lists.,
being given productivity through this allows me to really categorise my teeth and activities and projects I'm working on. I also use it as my mind on Friday just dump everything and any idea that comes up during the day and it does a really good job but classifying them,
"Sophisticated and Well designed to-do app, that works as a complete package even on free version. Personally, it's the best to-do app ever made.",
"Clean UI, and great integration with the desktop and web apps. The to-do list I always come back to.",
"So bloody good. I dont pay for apps, but i had to pay for this because of how good it is. The design thinking that has gone into this has thought of everything I've needed to far. Im writing this review because the app deserves it.",
"By default tasks are due today and it's not easy to find the option to change this. I wanted to save time, not spend time learning another tool. Uninstalling.",
"I've been feeling more completed lately. Like the things that I might normally be forgetting to do are now finally getting done. Every day. And I love finishing everything for the day and getting that message that says ""Take the afternoon off, good work!"" üòÜ",
Simple and easy to use. It should automatically sort by date though. You have to resort each time you enter something,
"Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users.",
Perfect and simple to use. Just what was needed to keep my buisness organised and staff up to date with tasks.,
learning to be more disciplined. this app helps me a lot... Only thing is that if the developers could make the reminder feature free it would be great.,
Meets my need to have an ever evolving list. Like calendar function and how it sends reminders. Keeping me on task.,
"todoist is simple and performs exactly as i need it to, no more no less. simple andstraight forward it is a great management app!!",
"I love this app. Its really quite simple and productive. It made me very organized this past few months and Im really grateful for it. By the way, I shared this to my friends in class.",
This app opens with a slow loading screen followed by making me wait for an animation to finish. I immediately quit and uninstalled.,
Premium version give you anything you could possibly want in a task organizer for business. Free version is great as a personal task organizer.,
"The new update is remarkable. Best todo list app available, though still has some issues with task scheduling that causes sub task duplication.",
Horrible platform. Nothing is easy and it wont let you change a date and no save button. Un-installed within hours,
"I love this app. Gets me to sort my minds daily tasks on the go as fast and as efficient as possible. Superb, gets the job done!",
In my opinion there isn't a better task management system than Todoist and the Andoid app and included widget are excellent. I have integrated Todoist with Ganttify and my calendar and manage all my tasks and projects with that combination.,
Do you what makes this app great and so superior than other? It allows me to sync my tasks to google calendar!!!! Do you know how hassle free my task list and schedule now? It's so bomb I love it!! TRY IT THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE!!!,
I like that you can repeat task in certain time period from completion date. This sets this app apart from most other to do apps.,
"Customizable, clean interface. Calendar integration. Cross platform. Very worthwhile.",
"Automatically completes task, for the day, as I open the program. I do not have any access to see what was completed or if I lost something important I have to do.",
You cant set reminders without paying. What is the point of an electronic to do list if you cant be reminded to do your tasts.,
Love the multilayer to do lists and the ease of organization. Breaking bigger tasks into smaller ones is a breeze!,
"I love this, is free, easy, adjustable, or simple a to keep list, and even if you forget you can always come back to the tasks later",
"I like the interface. Like any organizing app, the magic is in the user rather than the tool.",
Very easy to use and also syncs with my Fossil Sport smartwatch! Best to-do list app that I've used.,
Very simple clear helpful app. I usually can do lists but this makes it possible to make the most and actually refer to it again!,
it's not a user friendly app..too much complicated usage. it's of no use. don't have an option of recurring task.its not mobile friendly app... i prefer not use this app in my life.. waste of money and i dont know why this one cost is 300+ bucks..,
Great app. We'll integrated with my email client. Use on my Mac as well and everything works seamlessly. Using free version.,
"While adding time to a Task asked me to subscribe for premium üòÇ I said sorry, uninstalling. I can pay for an app for extra features but if I am expected to pay just for basic functionality then plz make it a paid app at the first place.",
"Google Calendar sync is fixed. I'm able to sync my tasks with my GCal, and the app is once again as useful as it always was.",
"I use this app more than 5 years and it's very productive. Now I have to report some problems & requests: 1. App widget have some problems like freezing in Microsoft luncher's feed. 2. You have many persian users from Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikestan and their immigrants around the world. So it's necessary to implement persian language and Jalali (Hijri Shamsi) calendar. For this requests you can use our persian users helps for translating and technical stuffs.",
"For the love of god explain me why there's no option to always show the tasks I've done??? I don't want to go to the main tab to the submenu, like WHY can't I reach today's ""done"" tasks from today tab??? And no option to make them not hidden as soon as a tap it done.",
Spiciest task management app around. Constantly pleasantly surprised when I discover new (and super useful!) features.,
I like how simple to use the app is. All basic functions that I need are covered in the basic version for free.,
"excellent for hobbies, work and projects. I really love it and it's really flexible. I use it all day as a premium user with no regrets! Love it",
"Fantastic, functional & user friendly. Todoist is responsible for a marked improvement in my productivity, and i will likely continue my membership for many years into the future.",
App worked great up until recent update that added check boxes..Now I keep accidentally marking tasks complete. Please add a setting to disable check boxes,
Really useful. I use it to organise my week and don't get stressed if I have to move tasks around to later days in the week.,
"Good app. I used it quite a bit, until the version changed and became incompatible with my phone.",
It has a lot of features. But I need simple one not that much complicated. I need one app which will manage my today task. It's good but not simple to use.,
"Definitely helps to keep on top of all my tasks. Easy to use interface, love being able to create projects.",
"Great interface, plenty of features. The app is easy to use and very helpful in managing my time.",
It's the perfect kind of list I've tried. Everything is great. It could be better if we had a calendar view as well.,
"I love it! Easy to navigate, prioritize, review, and helps I have yet to discover.",
I've started using Todoist again recently and fell in love with this app. It's one of the best list managers and the big advantage for me is that it is cross platform,
Easy to use and really customizable. I'm really enjoying it and it helps me keep everything organized. Definitely recommend.,
Seems like a great app if you didn't have to pay $36/year just to be reminded of a task. I deleted this app and will be downloading another one that won't try to take my money.,
Basic functions work all well. Good UI and sectionings of works. Will get you through the basic needs.,
"Like it so far, will see how it holds up Update after 1 year: stable, clean, intuitive interface, bump review to 5 stars",
"Excellent user experience. It has become a daily necessity for plannijg my days, weeks ,months and life.",
"It is simply amazing, by far the best to do list and productivity tool I have ever use. I definitely recommend it. For what it's worth, I never rate apps but this one really deserved it.",
"good app, but UI is confusing and smart date recognitions is buggy/doenst work: when i for example set the date to 3.5.2022 it will choose the 5th of march even tho i set the date format to DD/MM/YY using the 3/5 format unfortunately doenst fix the issue",
"Great app that helps me keep track of tasks. I love that I can connect with my husband and we can crest a project board with tasks that we both need to do, and who will do each one.",
Lacking calendar/monthly overview to be able to perceive tasks & projects also in a timely manner! So that essential dimension is just missing.,
"This app is interesting and easy to use, the best feature is that i can put the time in the description of the schedule, thats impressive",
has really helped me with large projects and to follow the bullet journal method of giving each task a date/time instead of keeping one long list.,
"After much research and using many different apps, I've settled on todoist as the most comprehensive and practical for my needs. I use a combination of GTD and other tools, and todoist copes well with them all",
A fantastic app for trying to manage your life and time.. yet still fail. But the app actually makes me remember that I have something to do. But still.. I won't do it.. for.. reasons.,
"It helps me to stay focus throughout the day. With priority option, i can decide which task i need to be done first. This apps is useful! Awesome!",
"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task.",
"So my keyboard recommended you, but you have no way for me to get help... I just had one simple question but the only help available is articles you choose to show...and only business customers get to interactive with you so since I couldn't contact you & i HATE secretive businesses so I'm here to tell you I am now not interested in your product (I was initially)... Good luck with the business customers since that's what you care about more. The end...",
"looks great, but reminders/notifications are a premium feature. Google calendar is better.",
"It's really a great to do list app, must try. But this app is lagging after latest update or maybe because I integrated Google Calendar and then removed it. Please help",
Solid free app. Being locked out of extra functionality with a paywall is a little irksome but nothing I can't got over. It does what I need it to.,
Very useful and hopefully more features for the free version. Have to pay for a lot of basic usages.,
This app has helped reduce my anxiety tremendously!! Being able to write down my daily tasks (no matter how menial) has been a game changer!,
"The App works wonderfully, i love it. But, it could work best with an alarm to notify you of the task/s at hand.",
Best 'to do list' app hands down. Been using for 3 years. Android + mac integration is spot on. I genuinely love it. So so so useful,
absolute productivity enhancer. Thank you for this amazing app. Looking forward to stick with it till i stick with technology.,
"I have been enjoying this app for a good while, over a year now. The recent update moved this app from ok, useful with some mild frustration, to amazing. Super pleased with this fix.",
So far so good. Very convenient especially the split into parts features. I'm a happy user.,
"Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete",
"You can't do anything with the free version. You get 5 lists or projects. So maybe if I lump everything under Business and Personal I can do something, but I can't really organize.",
"Fantastic App! Very user friendly, but loving the reminders and multiple options for organization.",
This is so rad. It's so easy. This works with my brain. I made all the lists and categories on my laptop and now I just add to them as needed on the app.,
Very easy experience making and completing tasks. Main reason I chose this app is because I can choose to make the take on my phone or in the desktop,
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap.",
It's nice but is it required that we really need to pay just for a timer? I mean other apps have premium too but they didn't lock the timer for tasks. Kinda frustrating to use the app.,
Love it but would like the widget to have a way to enter the full app like it used to. There's some things that are not accessible in the widget,
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing",
Enjoying it so far. I just cant seem to sync it with my calendar so I get no notifications for my to-do list and I need to open the app to check I need to do.,
I don't know what is going on The app works fine on my pc But on my phone it's keeping loading the content with blank page It may be a sync bug Hope you fix it,
"Flexible, Fast and Multi-Platform! Loving all of the capabilities Todoist offers - especially the Outlook and Gmail plug ins.",
"Hi, todoist team Android app is suddenly including brackets „Äê„Äë whenever I am trying to assign a project and a flag or PRORITY to a task.. request you to please fix the same example - Error sample [Out] [Personal]",
"Just a really good tasks app. Great syncing across the web, and a tidy interface.",
"As part of an overall strategy of organizing my life and using other apps to track my moods, meditate, and limit my time on social media, this app is an incredibly positive addition to my life.",
I downloaded the app yesterday. It was working well until today but now whenever I clicked on it shuts down and keep telling the app has a bug so I should contact the developers.,
"almost all that i need for a powerfull todo list, as a freelancer i want to use for work also, but we need more functional between tasks. meybe some agile, scrum, ... platforms integrations üòú",
I use this app everyday! It helps me keep up with what I have to do and shows me how often I put things off. Very organized and useful.,
"Been using this for a while now, it's good and I prefer it over other to-do list type apps. The app does everything it's advertised to and performs very well. üëç",
Tried several times to sign up and each time it said my password/s were too easy to guess and to choose a stronger password. I gave up and uninstalled.,
"New changes to free plan make app useless without subscription, putting crazy limits on features free users depend on. Total bait and switch.",
"Excellent app. I use it constantly. I love how this syncs between my phone, work computer, and home computer.",
"Best todo app ever. I use it every day, and I couldn't live without it. The best feature is the auto-tagging of input text.",
Definitely my go to auto fill password app. Makes switching from ios to android so much easier as I use them both for work and personal.,
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.,
"very inconvenient, too large interface for task bullet (very few tasks show on the screen). overall VERY limited functionality",
"It can be a little ruff to learn, but is so useful for ppl like me that have trouble with memory. The widget makes it alot easier for me.",
Really a very good task list manager and much more. I use it to plan my day and store materials for future use. It's an excellent app and I expect to use it long into the future.,
I love this app. Perfect for organizing all my homework assignments! Clean layout and easy to use.,
Old ui have facilities to click on the task and you can close or rename or edit the task but new one have some limitations so please roolback to old ui that is very good for all we are 40 users and all have problem,
It works great! Easy to input tasks and sort them. I am only using the non-premium version but I love it already!,
"Showing an already tick for recurring task will be helpful. Other than that, It was very convenient.",
Very useful especially if you're a forgetful person that has a lot of things to do. Customer Service is responsive too! Recommended!,
good app. but there is a fault. items are not arrange (sort) automatically by date in both app and widget. please fix this.,
It's very easy to get started using the app in a simple way and then grow to use some of the more advanced features. I like the UI. So far so good!,
I didn't care for some features because I had trouble using it but I had mixed feeling about a team to help keep me on task.. but I need that sometimes I like some free apps more .,
easy way to list daily tasks and create recurring ones. I like thst the lists are synchronized between phone & laptop.,
"It's just awesome. I tried a few different tasks managers before but I wasn't really happy with any of them. This one is so well made, though, I would recommend it to everyone, who wants to organize his life.",
"by far the best Todo app I've ever used,and I've used plenty...the design,the minimalistic look and feel,the many features under the hood....its awesome...highly recommended",
"Cracking app, surprised it's free. It's just like my old filofax. List what you need to do in order of importance and urgency, works really well, especially for an old duffer like me",
"Have been suffering with ADD for a long time, Todoist is one of the only apps that has helped me to function and stay on task. A life saver in the most literal way.",
"I really like it, it's great. The location based notifications are perfect for my ADHD mind.",
"Layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm, reminder etc are available only in premium version.",
"You will be asked to upgrade to a premium just for the sake of adding reminders. Well that is not satisfying, reminders should be available just in the beginning.",
"This is just for latest update. The UI gets blank, the tasks don't show and it keeps hanging .... Please fix the bugs",
To remove my account I have to install the app? What poltroon designed this? You'd have to be addled to think this is a good idea. I get email spam and to stop it I have to reinstall the app? Beware getting this.,
"Basically perfect. I just wish there were a native UI for Linux, but the web app is solid enough that I'm satisfied.",
"I have used todoist for several years now and it is simply spot on. Easy to use, easy to customise as you wish and so useful. I can heartily recommend.",
"Almost perfect, the only thing is missing is a persistent notification that works like the widget, just to add quick things",
Easy to use tool for becoming more efficient with my limited time and multiple projects. Great reminder!,
"Hey folks, it's an app I've heard lot of great things about, but it's not opening for me! I'm on Redmi note 8 pro. Can you please look into it? Thanks! I'll change the review as soon as it works. Best of luck!",
Been using todoist for around 3 years now...it helps me keep track of everything! Also love how easy it is to reschedule the to-dos that don't get done.,
"After connecting my Google account, the app is stuck loading the front page. I can't do anything on the app. Restarting the app and my phone didn't help.",
"It took less than an hour for the developer to start spamming my email, so this app was uninstalled within 1 hour. No idea how good it is. The day after uninstall, i keep receiving spam...",
"As a GTD and productivity enthusiast, I think Todoist is the best task manangement app on the market. Simple, yet it has all the advanced functionality you need to effectively manage your work.",
"super handy... quick set up and entry of tasks, clean interface, good function set for free version.",
"Todoist is enjoyable for me to enter, organize, prioritize and plan what I want to do, to remember and keep lists like wish lists.",
"I'm still learning and I like the app, but I wish there were task durations and I wish I could easily review tasks that I have accomplished.",
"This is definitely the all round to do list app that I need. Nice UI, text recognition, and tasks management",
"I love this app, this fit my needs. I would give 5 star if you also put a calendar widget, then this app would be perfect. I highly recommend it.",
"Greatest App I have ever used. Well thought out, organized, the only App I can honestly say that I use every single day. Never forget a thing! Helps me sleep better at night.",
Really well thought out app. I like how flexible it is and the way subtasks are visible within the project.,
"My go-to task list app. I basically run my whole life through Todoist, it has great UI and it syncs super well.",
"Great app and it really helps me stay on top of things, though I do wish I could be able to put events in too for example :friends birthday from maybe 10 am to 2 pm and things like that",
"It was working fine until last update. Now it can't recognise what date I'm typing. Instead today ""at 10"" it skips to some other day. It is very annoying to use app like this",
Really been useful in keeping me productive and on track. I've started over after a recent kidney transplant and this app has helped me keep the structure I need in my life.,
This used to be my go to app. Now you have to pay for even the smallest features like setting a time on your reminder. Uninstalling and finding another.,
Makes me feel very productive. nice app. i like the fact that there is a chrome extension for this app so i can sync my to do list on my laptop and phone.,
App is great as a Wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money? It is not possible. Unfortunately i won't use this app.,
Perfectly easy to use and follow. I appreciate the reminders every day too. I accidentally ended up relying on this app instead of my calendar app. It's just so much better!,
GAME CHANGER!! It's multi functional so you can view what you need without being overwhelmed yet super easy to use.,
"Great app, I love how well thought UX it has. Thanks to the free month to try it I could really try if the app is good for me and now I am happy premium customer because it is by far the best app for todos. I am using it for my a bit enhanced GTD and my productivity has actually skyrocketed ever since I use Todoist üòä",
"Please add the task anounser in this app. Because, if we are away from yhe mobile then we can easily leason it . But now it only remember us in the form of notification but i want it as like alarm means more sound please please solve my problem please",
"Good App, the only things I would add is a visual user face and remove the glitch of prevously typed task being posted with the new ones.",
"todoist is easy to use, has all the features I want, and really organizes my life. game changer, highly recommend!",
Was great before the new 'redesign'. Now it's a PITA to reschedule things. I wish they'd stop messing with things. May have to check out a different app,
"I like the concept but it is very complicated, specially entering recurring tasks or editing.",
Anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless. Uninstalled.,
Successfully used this app to manage my professional and personal life over several years since first installation. I cannot speak highly enough of its reliability and ease of use.,
"Best to-do/productivity app. Amazing and feature-rich, clean and organized look. 10/10.",
I love using this app. I moved from Wunderlist (canned by Microsoft) to To Do and the featuers of Todoist are the most intuitive and helpful.,
Great program to keep myself organized. I just found out that I can send projects to my employee and they update on his app as I update mine which is very useful for work.,
Absolutely great app. Use it to monitor my packed engineering college schedule. It works across my phone and computer! Can't recommend enough,
By far the best app I have ever managed to find for productivity üôå Brilliant in every way. I'm addicted and feel like I am achieving much more without feeling overwhelmed.,
"I suggested this in the past, but the ability to set a persistent reminder, like an alarm, would be a great addition to the app.",
I couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks.,
"when you use it like it's designed, it helps incredibly to get your task laid out, your life organized, and things accomplished.",
"Since last major update, rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled, preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day. Productivity killer.",
"Good application, it keep me focused on my goals. One downside is whenever I put a new task on a specific day it doesn't areange it automatically, i have to do this manually",
"Latest update causes app to crash and stop syncing. Quick response and an update later, seems fixed. Thanks team",
"Solved: my two filters' queries was replaced the string ""query"". -> logged out and re-logged in the app and the queries were recovered. Thanks so much ‚ú®",
"quite a few tasks are unavailable unless you pay. I like the reminders, but think I will stay with my Outlook calendar",
Why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app.. what dev.. you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that. Ridiculous.. uninstalled.. just needed a to do list app as simple as that.,
Clean interface that doesnt get in the way. Also enjoy how it parses your tasks for things such as due dates.,
Absolutely love the app but the new checkboxes take up too much space. Please add an option to hide them.,
"Very easy to use. Love that I can just type ""tomorrow"" or ""Friday"" and it knows to just add it to that particular day. Very intuitive to use.",
I just love this app! I link this to my laptop one too! My organization in tasks and to-do lists have never been more satisfied with an app!,
"Brilliant, some quirks but once you learn them then its great. Love its ability for sharing into todoist as comments and tasks, from other apps.",
"Great app. I'm a 'list person' and am loving this app as i no longer have loads of paper lists, and have my list handy wherever /whenever i want it now :)",
"very useful, especially since it synchronises with your account and can be updated from all your devices!",
"great design, intuitive, and a very robust free version that is not intrusive with ads on every action",
I started using this for 1 week and I already fall in love with the product. The app is simple and intuitive yet powerful enough to make your days much more productive.,
Simple. Brilliant. Love some of the extra features like sending via email and all that.,
The ability to easily reschedule tasks I can't complete today is SUPER helpful - and makes it easier to end my day with a clean slate!,
"Great app, easy to use, no bumps or lumps so far, no annoying 24/7 interruptions like a lot of apps produce !!!",
It's easy to set up but one downside is that to set a reminder on a task I have to upgrade to premium and its not something I wanted to begin with,
I use to love this app until their current terms of service. It gives them a license to use my data any way they want without limitation. NO THANKS!,
Even though you pay for a subscription. It doesn't save your previous lists of you stop paying for a month. Sucks.,
"have been using it for years. very quick and easy to add a to do with the project hashtag and date tags (eg ""tomorrow"" auto adds it to my list for tomorrow).",
"Really good app and nice design, nice features! Unfortunately no reminders option for the free use, no one time purchase option",
Been using for more than a year now.. the way to set up recurring tasks is a game changer. It really helps me to be more productive.,
"so far, this app has been my way of organizing my tasks and myself. i'm glad that it's also integrated with Google Home so i can check my tasks as i dress up every morning for work. good job!",
Really helps me keep my projects in order. I always have 10-15 construction jobs going at one time. Being able to walk in a house and making my list by project with reminders and emails is awesome,
i used to have severe prejudice towards planner apps but this one certainly made it beyond. The free version does what pro versions from other app offer. Looking forward to upgrading later.,
"I just would like to have also the possibility to set and see the amount of time estimated per each task or group of tasks, otherwise I am just in love for the app.",
very intuitive and easy to figure out. good team collaboration too. helpful notifications.,
"Great helper in my everyday life. I use it literally every day and all the time! Thanks a lot for your work, I really appreciate it. And I like articles from the Doist team! You're great!",
To-do lists are the most powerful tool if you want to be much productive. Todoist is one of the bests in this era. Highly recommended!,
"I really enjoy this app, it is great when u haven't completed the thing you were supposed to do so it sends u a little reminder. I would highly recommend.",
"Its a really good app, but I wished that I am able to see the full agenda through the widget and not just for the next week. Maybe there's an option for that but couldn't find it.",
"Fantastic app, excellent service!  Moved to this from Toodledo, and couldn't be happier.  The Todoist team actually built a high quality Android app.  Thanks!",
"Really great app that has helped keep me on track as I juggle work, studying and home life. Premium is well worth the price if you use it daily.",
Great app and constantly improving. Appreciate the hard work by developers which made a difference üëç However agree with other users that the ability to open the app from the widget was helpful and was taken away,
Been using the free version for a week now. Really helping me keep track of my work and personal tasks. Love being able to use it on my desktop and phone,
"Enjoying the app, but can't figure out how to get it on my Galaxy Active 2 watch. Whenever I try to find the app for it, I get directed to the phone app.",
This app helps a lot with organising my life. its not complicated to enter things and it's easy to form habits because it runs simply.,
"Hi there , can you add a option to select all task and delete in the show complete task section ? Is quite annoying you have to select each of the task and delete . Thank you",
Fantastic design and functionality. Pls update to new Google material design and add a calendar widget. That'd be awesome.,
"Works really well. A great to do list app, while offering so much more, even on the free plan. 10/10.",
"Very well designed. Natural language is very useful. Works well on Android, Windows and Web",
"Please I need help. When I try to log in with Google in the app, it said ""Unknown error occurred. Please check again in a few seconds"". I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but no such lucküò¢",
"Exceptional experience !! Thanks to all the team. I don't see any mistake for the moment,but surely, you can increase the app. Courage !!",
"Todist is intuitive, easy to use and effective. It gives you all the functionality needed to manage all of your activities no matter the size or complexity.",
"It's easy to add all my task and schedule them. Even I can create projects and many other things. After starting using this app, things are in my control",
It is easy to use and fits my needs pretty much. Cost and time on the task level would be a 5 star review,
"so far, better than any other app doing the same. very easy to use, but the free version, which we use now, lack of many features we found in others.",
"Seems to be a good one, but some critical options and features will only be available when you upgrade your app which demands some money per month.",
"The best to-do app out there, for certain. Downside: not compatible with Android System-wide dark mode.",
"Better than MS To Do. Almost as good as Wunderlist. Only thing missing is the gratifying ""ding"" sound when checking things off.",
Simple and easy to use. Available for windows too so i can sync with my laptop. Good eficiency.,
"not bad for organizing, would be nice if you could set tasks to repeat as necessary, or allow you the option to categorize tasks",
"I used many todo apps ,but this app has fullfield my need for having a board for tasks that i don't know even when i gonna start ,to my daily habits that no longer to be recreated and can be scheduled percically and also normal todo task",
The most expansive task management system I have ever had the pleasure of working with. If you are following the Getting Things Done methodology by David Allen there is no better one than this!,
"Great app, only using the free version. Its a bit expensive for me to get to full version, but i love how easy it is to use and the practicality is great!",
I truly love this app. It helps me my daily act together and look ahead at my week. It's simple to use and I love the ability to break down big projects.,
Simple. Organized and yet flexible. Wish the alarm feature for to do items was on the free,
I would like to be able to move multiple tasks as subtasks instead of one at a time. That is the only criticism I have the rest is awesome!,
"- installed this app to compare with Google tasks, which is free - realized I can't create reminders with the free version, which I can with Google tasks - uninstalled after a few minutes - receiving email spam for 4 days now Come on, guys.",
"Reminders are premium feature ? really ? i understand you need premium subscription to make the company survive , but making the main functionallity of a ""to do "" app premium is a bit much. no thanks .",
Why didn't I find this app earlier? Great app!! Since I started using this app I have been working faster towards accomplishing my goals. Very easy to navigate and is a definite game changer. Shared it with everyone and now you üòÉ,
This app was really helpful for me and made my daily life easier. Unfortunately the last update with the new HUD has completely destroyed my workflow.,
"Updated to pro but reminders are VERY clunky. Why should I physically write when I want a reminder, why can't I just use the same UI as when I schedule it (that is, by using the clock)?",
"Doesn't let you say you did something yesterday, which is for me a big deal, as I browsed the options looking for a way to do that almost everything was only a premium option",
"I keep coming back to todoist... why is that? ive tried 30+ task managers, but keep coming back. You definitely need to review your tasks weekly but its just a reliable tool.",
Easy to use. Integration with other devices and applications are seamless. Well done with a slick app.,
I've never been able to stick to using a To Do list until now. Great interface and features.,
Used it for a month and am loving it so far. It would be great if you add a feature which lets you add an estimated time for a given task,
"Absolutely loving it, been using Todoist for years now and it only gets better with time. Simple, logical, and available both as an app and via web.",
"This app is so cool. Before using this app I used Google task and that was not that perfect but it was okay for me for a long time. But when I got Todoist app, it changed my whole experience. I highly recommend this app. This app is so fun to use. I love it.",
Very good app....good interface Easy entries and keywords Seeing Whole year review was truly good and that's why I came here to rate them. Thank you.,
Horrible update. It removed Sub-projects in widgets which is used to be very very very useful for a Neurosurgeon like me. Please update again so that I can use my widgets of sub projects.... please please please,
"Really great. It is clear & effective. I can create my own projects and follow them, It shows me tasks from yesterday that I forgot to do and so forth.",
love it! love how it lets me edit on Android widget. also love the amount of subcategories there are! lots of options and pretty easy to figure out.,
"Intuitive UI, but no way to customize fields. Also no reminders for free accounts.",
"Todoist sent me a welcome email, although I never signed up. Now I'm getting email reminders for a task related to crypto currency. Hackers are using this platform for social engineering and fraud. Todoist, please do more to verify new accounts.",
Easy to use app. Well designed interface. Email and phone notifications are very useful,
Great application! Since I started to use it just cannot stop. Really improves your time management skills.,
the app is working well for me so far. somethings i wish it had. 1. A description space for each project (to write the goal statement) 2. End date for each project 3. an option to feature a task in more than one project,
I really enjoy the app. It's very efficient and helps me stay motivated about getting stuff done throughout the day.,
"Love the options for managing individual tasks, and that I can also interact with the list via web browser.",
Very easy to setup a project and creating subtasks required; and checking out completed tasks - achieved when subtasks menu is empty. üò∫ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è,
Easy to use and works well across devices. having reminders set by location is pretty nifty.,
"Didn't stick with todoist in the past, merely because there was only one subtask level. Now there are 4. Todoist is the best. Hands down.",
Was a waste of money and time. More time making/managing to-do lists than doing the projects. Not worth the money.,
This is a great tool to keep me on track with my tasks. The recurring options are very flexible!,
"Could somebody explain how do i make this app send me a notification at a scheduled time of my reminder? Right now it works like a list of reminders, that don't remind me to do anything at a time.",
Todoist feels like magic on UI part. NO other app in entire universe look beautiful. Rest is all good. Although I am not using it because notification is not free and Its far precious than i can afford,
The most simple and best user friendly app but as a productivity tool it lacks some features like a weekly view and setting days (not just date),
"Would be a great app if notifications worked. I only get the daily notification, no others for specific tasks set to be done at specific times.",
"Working like PA, always behind me to complete the task. IAM new this but good experience, I would like know about full function of the app then I can give more and better Reviews.",
"Its a really great app! I love all the different things you can filter by - project, tab, priority, date. Awesome üëå",
This app has changed my life. I used to be a procrastinator but with the help of this app I have taken control over my behavior. I would highly recommend if you struggle with getting things done.,
The best Todo organiser I've used. available on all devices I've used and syncs perfectly. Can't really ask for more,
This is a great app used it for quite a while but lately now when I try to add projects in the app not on the web it doesn't add my projects just takes the phrase and puts brackets around it,
"Worth getting Premium, I miss having Things from iOS but now that I have an Android I use this! I tried all the other to-do apps and found this one to be the best available!",
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app,
"Very nice! Wish it was completly free, but obviously the creators gotta make money. No ads, very smooth, must use app for productivity!",
"Amazing, easy to use system that works well offline and synchs seamlessly with the chrome extension.",
It is a great app. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications,
"It's a SUPER COOL app! BUT it would be EVEN COOLER if we could customise the rank names we get after a particular number of Karma? ALSO, just a suggestion, but can we have the ability to customise what we want to call Karma? Like for example, we want to call Karma as Mana or EXP but it still has the same function as Karma. I think that would be AMAZING if it were to be implemented. (‚óï·¥ó‚óï‚úø)",
it works great for simple tasks that I always seem to forget to do like pick up dry cleaning or call insurance agent.,
"This tool, once setup to your style, does an excellent job of keeping you organized and on task.",
I am extremely happy with the app. This app is user-friendly and Absolute best reminder app in the market. I would encourage others to use this app as daily reminder app. Thank you todoist team Fantastic job & Keep it up!,
Requires login/account I don't see any reason to require a login for to do list management. Not clear whether it will work when the device is offline.,
"excellent app i use it with work projects and college studies, great tool for both would recommend to anyone wanting to be more organized",
It's a gr8 app. Very useful for daily planners. But i would suggest it to have even weekly as well as a monthly planner.,
"Login required. A to do list should not require an internet connection, let alone login. I would rather pay with cash than with data.",
No week numbers!! The app very well built but there is no option to enable week numbers. Please add week numbers features in coming updates.,
"This app is a game changer. Google Calendar is awesome, but this app takes productivity to another level.",
10/10 recommend. I've tried a good amount of reminder apps but I love the simplicity and ease of this app. It also has a lot of cool features.,
"Perfect task tracking app I absolutely love automatically set repeated tasks. For example, you write ""pay rent every 25th"" and the task sets repeat every 25th day of month",
"Touch & go, plus Google Assistant stated: it's not support with devise (integration). I'm using a Android phone and have the app on it.",
"Absolutely fantastic app! I've read many complaints about the lack of flexibility of the app, but I think that there's plenty of wiggle room for personalization. I rate it 5 stars. Why does it show one star then? Because the app prompted me to give a review :)",
Totally love this app! I had no idea they had something like this. You have no idea how much of a relief it is to have something that I can keep organized and get those 'things to remember' out of my head! I don't have to worry about forgetting anything!,
did it help with getting my tasks done ? id say yes to an extent. even if I procrastinated a bit it is very satisfying to check the boxes when done. i didnt delete the app right away. still have it,
"I've been using it for years, it was great, all of a sudden I can't create more than five projects because it's a pro feature. Disappointing.",
"it all what we need. Its simple, intuitive and look minimalist.",
"Just let me buy the pro app, why does every thing have to be subscription based? I simply want reminder functionality and it'll cost me 4 bucks a month in perpetuity for that VERY basic function.",
i feel like im more productive durring the day and i can get more done. i like with the premium you get more features like the colors. i change my colors out every month.,
Nice clean app (I use it for personal non-work-related projects). I use it to remind me to do things instead of just watching Netflix.,
lets me make tasks with reminders. which is all i need. they charge for that though. theres probably an app out there that would let me do that for free. but im using this one that is not free.,
"The google calendar integration is awesome, this feature alone makes it better than most other todo apps. Really enjoying it",
perfect solution. I was in trouble about finding best solution for my daily to do listing. After i use this app I niticed that I alteady found the perfect solution. Thanks!,
"Really useful as a college student, but would prefer an easier way to avail the student discount.",
It's great for organising but the app is bugging out. A lot of tapping etc makes events disappear!,
"I BOUGHT this app, then they switched to a subscription model. There should be something that grandfathers their existing customer base in, I'm not happy with this financial arrangement",
Loving this app! But there's a problem I'm facing that the widget doesn't get updated until I reboot the phone. Please fix this.,
i love the fact it won't come in your way but helps you track any task that cross your mind in middle of work so you can review and organize them later. Todoist made me a more productive Person. Thanks üôè‚ù§Ô∏è,
just great I recommend paying the subscription for the added benefits because this is the to do list that will never let you down. I use it on my pc/tablet/phone and its so seamless,
A light feel with heavyweight features ready to go! I've combined this with IFTTT and my mail to make flagged emails and email's keywords to pull tasks to Todoist. Love the web interface too!,
This is a very clever and intuitive app. for some reason the widget is slow to respond to taps.,
"I use this everyday to check off tasks and to remember tasks. I have used it for personal projects, family remodeling projects, and family shopping lists.",
This app has been a wonderful addition to my quest to being more productive. it's one of the few apps which I'm considering getting a paid subscription.,
I think this is exactly what I've been looking for since. This app is so perfect to track my daily method of operation DMO. I loved it. Keep it on and up. Thank you all for creating this app,
"It's really convenient and beauty app, but I need more functions and they are paid. Can I watch a lot of ads to have paid functions, please?",
This app keeps me working with no rest for the many things I scheduled for myself. I've should not have downloaded this app because it doesn't miss a thing.,
"Amazing, life changing. Just wish that the phone version showed all the project colours, please fix!",
It's a wonderful support to keep your schedules intact even when one is too busy to keep track of events..,
"How have I not given Todoist 5 stars yet? Love the web experience, and the app ia just one extension of that. I use the ""add task"" widget almost every day with google voice to text to take notes.",
Repeating previous posts- don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium. It's just a shell not worth the space it requires.,
I've tried a ton of todo list apps. This is the easiest and best one that syncs with web,
"amazing time management improvements- has changed the way I do things to make me not miss things, be more efficient and feel more confident because I know I'm organized.",
"Very easy to use from my laptop, tablet, or phone. I can't believe I stuck with paper lists for so long.",
"It was working perfectly, when it suddenly started glichibg and kicking me off the app every 3 seconds. I then deleted, and I'm using a different app now.",
"Works perfectly. Incredibly fair subscription system that's worth the money, but not necessary for a good user experience.",
"This sucks, entered a bunch of tasks and the app set them all to completed and removed them - now after start over! Using something else for sure.",
Simple and effective. Had a great experience using this app to help improve my productivity. Reminders were very helpful.,
I request you if it is possible then please add a list which shows all our comepleted/uncompleted tasks on the top with date and day so it would be a lot of favour on me I'm tired of finding my comepleted tasks in the huge list.,
"Really good for managing all my tasks for the day. I particularly love the widget, that always reminds me of my tasks.",
"Stupid app, only usefull for setting a to do list, which you could do with google docs or other things that you would usually already have, the reminders require payment, I would recommend using another app.",
"This app is simple and useful. I really didn't think I would use it, but after a week of entering all my tasks in the app I'm impressed. Again, simple and to the point.",
"I Iove this app. But I am so urgent to know can I make finished task as"" checked"" this allows me have overall look. But know I have to use ""undo"" to see fade color finished task. Please please reply thank you,",
"Very useful, quick to understand and start using, quite effective for managing general tasks or recurring reminders.",
"Incredible app! My life depends on it! So smooth, so user-friendly and so easy to use. Made my life much more productive! Thanks a ton to the development team!",
"Todoist is as simple as you want it to be or as complex as you need - it works great for organizing my tasks, whether they are work related or just personal things like chores",
Tried Trello too involved and expensive for small operation. Todoist Works beautifully and just what we need. They obviously care about taking good care of their application,
Intuitive and capable. Integrates well with Alexa. Couldn't enjoy it more.,
the best app i have found on play store to organize and prioritize my tasks and share the same with my friends and colleagues. Thanks to the team for making such a wonderful app.,
"Pretty happy with the app, but reminders are a paid feature. I think they should be free, because they are so basic for a todo app",
"i quite happy after using this app.Before this,I dont know what i should do in my life,everyday feeling guilty for not doing anytjing productive.But now I can set up my goals,the hobbies,learning plan in this app,then I just relax and see at ""Today"" section,i just complete the list then I will be good.Plan my life everyday,complete it everyday.Everyday is moving forward",
"Its the best and cleanest free app in the genre, i especially love it since its ad free and so easy to use, wonderfully designed with the user in mind",
I put everything in todoist. My day does not formulate without it. I know what I need to do next with todoist. Set things to be completed tomorrow or next month. Perfect for a person who needs organization to function......or else we don't know where to start. I love this app. I'll be a lifelong user.,
This app is easy to use and has helped me to get and stay organized. Honestly one of the best time management/to do apps I've ever used.,
Didn't like the interface and deleted the app. It started to sent me notifications to my email. Too annoying,
"Damn man! I am a graduate student in Civil Engineering. In this busy hectic schedule, I have to keep in mind about varoius doings throughout a day. This app surely made it a lot easier for me. Thanks and hats off to the devs. Take love. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
Can't manage my life without this app. Only issue I'm facing right now is that I get logged out of it often when using it through the chrome extension.,
Easy to use across all devices. Brilliant for keeping everything organised. Excellent app.,
"The free tier could allow more projects. 5 is pretty low. But the app is truly great, the best in this category for me.",
Great app. The only thing missing is tighter integration with Google Tasks (most of my tasks originate from email ang Google makes this extremely easy).,
Todoist has all the features I want and is simple to use. I have high hopes of it revolutionising my organisation and productivity.,
App consistently crashing within seconds of opening. Still crashes with latest update.,
All my unnecessary stress is gone. I tried other apps before but this 1 is the 1 i needed. FREE or $48 for a year ($4/month).. thanks so much for making it!,
Wasted too much of my life trying to get a receipt for my expenses (twice) and finally gave up. Probably because i downgraded back to free. I promise never to use this app ever again. Ever.,
one of the best app if you want yourself to stick to a schedule. put icon of this app on homescreen of your phone so you dont mis your focus and other things will be taken care by app,
I've been using Todoist since 2016 for personal and work projects. I simply love it. Paid my premium subscription yesterday. Couldn't be happier!,
The only to-do app that I need! Just right features with no nonsense. Helps me stay on top of my work and personal life both! Much appreciated!,
"Being able to declutter my mind by putting the tasks I need to do on it, has been helping me sleep better already, since I don't have to keep thinking on all the things I have to do the next day or week.",
"This app is exactly what I was looking for , I have organize my projects and personal life with an eagles view and I don't have to worry about forgetting anything.",
Been using this app maybe for 8 years now and daily for my business ... couldnt ask for any better. Helpsbme tremendously Improve my business This is my first review on play store and it goes to this app because really deserves a bit of my time .,
"Not easy to use at all, especially the reminders. Also, can't put to-dos in calendar.",
I have this on my phone and desktop so it's really straight forward to add and keep track of tasks and set reminders whilst on the go would definitely recommend,
Easy to use and tracks at exactly the right level for me. Premium is definitely worth it.,
"Amongst all free todo apps I've tried, this one is the most simple yet feature rich one. I wish I could have 2 accounts on the app.",
I have been using todoist for years for my personal life. It is my personal assistant!! Juggling all the commitments in life is alot easier using todoist.,
"Not intuitive. I swear items have disappeared. If you want to see what you have already done, you have to pay for premium. No thanks. Back to using Keep.",
"After the new update, adding a task to a section in a project doesn't work. It just doesn't do anything. Samsung Galaxy A52",
Adored this app until they intentionally broke the recurring hourly on completion. Now I have to waste a lot of time looking for another app.,
Excellent app for planning both home and work life. Integration with Alexa and calendars very good and I use this across multiple devices,
I love the app. It has saved me countless hours. It has given me insight into my productivity and has MEASURABLY improved my life.,
Honestly i really love it! Easy and fun to use! I have tried a few to do list apps and this is by far my favorite! And im a picky person.,
"Everything cool and it would be better if we could be able to set deadlines and have more freedom with the date setting (like ""every mon, tue and friday for three months at 5pm"")",
I love the fact that I can create a list of items to do and check them off as I go right here in this app. The notifications are like my own personal secretary. It has helped me tremendously with productivity.,
This app is where I have outsources my brain. My entire life runs on this app and it's so smooth compared to many others. I love how seamless the experience feels between devices,
"can be 5 star but if you add an option to repete tasks and it contains some additional options ( how many times it will repete , 3 day a week , on mondays , ets ) it will be more professional thanks in advance ..",
I've always struggle with planning until this app came into my hands. The integration with G Calendar and the ability to create subtasks makes it easy to mannage your activities.,
I been using this with the getting things done process and it has been a huge win for being productive! It isn't perfect but works better then anything else I have tried to use.,
Todoist is a great app and has grear integration between the mobile app and my gmail account in my browser. it's simple and easy to use. highly recommended,
This app is truly awesome. Best to-do list app I've ever used. I have no problem paying for the premium version. Has definitely added value to my life,
"I am a new user and mostly use the widget, but neither can I tick the DONE tasks nor am I able to create new tasks from the widget. Infact none of the buttons work on the widget.",
Upgraded on Wear OS but now does not open; Edit: the app has been further updated and has fixed the bug described above so increased the rating; Edit 2: Reduced the rating as Wear OS app really slow,
Hi Team Any chance there's a web version I can use in my PC? I'm loving the app so much that it would be handy to have it on my PC to view and sync at all times!,
"Simple, Clear and very helpful. I'm a Graphic Designer and I mostly use the app for managing project tasks and it works very well for me.",
"The app is good, but notification emails are so annoying and can't be stopped. Please fix it.",
Best Experience of recording the to do list and planning my week ahead.. I like the aspect where you can view 7 days tasks together.. Good work guys.. Really appreciate it.,
I'm someone that needs a little bit of assistance to make sure I stay organised and on remain on track. Todoist does the job perfectly.,
"5 star is not enough for review this app! Such a great app of productivity series! I use this app and I find some unique feature than any other to do list app! Afterall, It is a great app for productive to do list.",
I have been using Google tasks for a couple years - switched to Todoist a week ago and I love the change. Grouping by project is a game changer.,
"Great app, does everything it says it would, I would recommend to others who want to follow a planned routine to maximize productivity.",
most organized to do list. and it's so so nice when the free version has so many useful features! thank you!!!,
Very cumbersome to use. Can't even understand how to add repeated Reminders. I happy with ticktick. No switch required.,
"after I updated my android to the new system, I havent been able to tick off one singular task. I have to select multiple. what is the fix for this???",
"Too much brilliance,marvelous and outstanding,as an app developer I strongly recommend,kindly give project limit exceeds atleast ten. Add some alarm notification if todo planned activity occurred.",
Very useful to keep me motivated and helps my time management skills. Wish some features weren't only for premium members like adding comments to tasks.,
Still learning the ropes. But loving being more productive and planning ahead. Great app. And on different platforms. Thanks,
"Thanks for creating this app. It's really good but I hope you can add a ""PLAN MY DAY"" feature where we can easily schedule our today's tasks within the day and a summary monthly view with color tags so we know whicb project are on that particular day. Thanks and God bless",
"Need to make an account, and spammed with emails after signing up. I wanted a to-do list app not a way to sell my data.",
They send email spam without unsubscribe links. Update: You don't consider an email about pricing a marketing mail? That's an Olympic level of mental gymnastics.,
awesome app. I am so much more productive! love it. has changed my day greatly. if you feel overwhelmed and do not know how to start this is perfect.,
"This is a best app made easy. most of the time I accomplish my days tasks because of the email reminders. End now that I write things down i do more, this is must have. Thank team Todoist",
"5 mins in and im already having a bug. Created a new project and clicking on it doesn't do anything, way to go as a first impression.",
I really enjoy this app I use it everyday it is super easy to use and has so many options from board colours to different years.,
I love how easy and intuitive this is to use while being so detailed and thoughtful. I really like the way this app is organized and this will really help with my ADHD,
I am a raw beginner but looking forward to finding out the finer points. Several videos posted online have given me an insight towards what is possible.,
"Free version missing key functions and paid version is VERY expensive now. Unfortunately there are now better, more inexpensive options.",
Please make it possible to quickly switch from the widget to the app. One star to attract attention. Will make it 5 as soon as widgetToAppButton appears.,
I'm using the premium version a few days now. I'm not getting any notifications for my reminders. I checked the menu and everything is fine. Is there something you can do to help?,
The best app for managing your tasks. The Karma motivtes me to do my tasks on a regular basis. Highly recommended!,
I haven't explored everything but what i have i love it. Easy but not plain. I'll give a more detailed once i dig into it's entirety.,
I've been using it for several years now. It's the best. My wife and I are using shared shopping lists with an app widget. Synching is perfect.,
"Its been a year since i last had this app and i must say it is already a majorly huge improvement than what freemium was before. 3 stars since its day one still, but i have high hopes that this will end up with another star or two. Thank you!!!",
Everything is premium. lots of useful things are premium and you actually have to buy them. everything except that is good.,
Never been able to get organized. Todoist is the first system to ever work for me. I'm new to it but it's already become such a part of daily life I think it'll be a real game-changer for me!,
No support for Arabic language from next version... It's gonna be the only to do list with no support for Arabic!! Time to look for a new to do list app.,
"Very useful app for this who can't organize day and has a mess in the plans. Tried for free and like it, now going to premium for more functions. Hope it will help everyone üéØ",
Really good free option. Works well for me and my girlfriend (Apple user) to be able to make and share a variety of lists and information.,
"So far, it's been nice to keep track of projects and things I need to do. I like the sub tasks option and this app is amazing. Thank you developers.",
"Simple design, clean UI, useful for use as GTD and also very powerful when using its filters. The best IMHO.",
Best app for managing tasks. I live by GTD and Todoist is the perfect tool for this. And it's always improving. Love it!,
I've relied on this app for years. For some reason now I can no longer find completed tasks when I search for them. When did this change?,
Now it is working (from my previous review). The integration with smartphone and desktop is really good.,
I can't believe I forgot to rate this app. I absolutely LOVE it. I pair it with Alexa to keep track of the things I need to do. It helps at home and at work. I cant think of anything this app is lacking.,
Very handy. as i have this horrible addiction to look at my phone I thought I might as well use it to improve my productivity. ;-) its smooth.,
"Have been using the premium version for a couple of years now and its the best for organisation by far. Simple, does what you need it to do!",
I've heard such good things and I was so excited to try this app... but it just keeps crashing. My phone tells me it has a bug. Now I'm just disappointed,
I've set up several reminders but none of them went off at the time I had them set for! Figured it out. I have to pay so I'll just find another app.,
Loves it!I will recommend this to other's. I also loved when it stays on my phone screen of the list.I can see it.Good job.I enjpy seeing it right there.I not evrn need to open the app to see my list.I had the theme black.,
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know.",
"Used to be 5 stars, but now you need pro version for reminders? Isn't that a basic feature of a decent to-do list app. I'm changing it to one star.",
Thanks for bringing back the 'open app' button on the widget. Now just let us decide if new tasks should be inserted on top or at the bottom of the list please.,
"It's revolutionised the way I work as a medical student. Makes going from one task to another effortless, allows me to stick to breaks, etc",
This app is awesome for keeping To-Do lists and collabotaing with others. I have the pro version and I find it to be well worth the money.,
"""reminders are a paid feature"" That's one of the most basic feature of a to do app!! Why even bother to have a free version? THIS IS STRICTLY A PAID APP.",
"Super simple to use. Simpler than Asana, plus with both labels and projects, it allows great ways to cross reference. I'm using it to implement GTD with great success",
This app works well and had some adv features. I am only interested in a basic app. It does all I ask very well.,
"it's good, but I can't find list of completed tasks, they disappear from everywhere after completion, is it possible to see them in the app?",
"I have barely began using this app (less than 15 minutes) and I am already in love with the app. The Terms you have to agree to alone are just so assuring and satisfying. Kudos developers, kudos!",
Best todo list app I've ever used. I've been a happy premium customer for over 2 years now. It's well worth the $4/month.,
"Much more polished than Google Tasks. For example you can search for a task, which last time I tried want possible in Google Tasks.",
"This saved me as I journeyed into my career of teaching. So much to do and so little time, this app kept me organised in my new chaotic life!",
Buggy. Also I'm looking for a list with specific alarms and alert to keep me on task daily. Can only get that feature if you pay for it,
"I love it SO much! It's skyrocketed my productivity level & my focus, it's easy to use, & the features in premium are so worth it- thank you to the Todoist Team!!",
"this has completely changed the way I work and get things done at home. makes it easier to get everything done, has just enough of a game element and is easy to use",
"Love this app, just one thing what I don't like is that I can't turn on notifications somehow, so I do have to visit the app every time to see what plans are there written",
"I was already organized, but now it's even better. The connection to drive Gmail and android is the key and why I chose todoist over Omni focus.",
"A piece of garbage considering the hype around it. Without paying monthly or yearly, basic one DOES NOTHING SPECIAL! $5/month to add reminder !!! I get it from Google for free. THIS APP IS GARBAGE!",
I use it constantly to remind me to get things done. I love that I can set times and it will give me notifications. It's the best app I've got!,
"The most basic feature of setting a reminder is behind pay wall. Instant red flag, Uninstalled. I'm not paying a penny for poor design like this.",
"I think it's a really great app, it helps you with planning, it has proved helpful to me as I always need to plan prior to something I do...",
helps me keep track of things I need to do throughout the day. It's very helpful when reminding me what I haven't done the next day as well. Overall this app is great for keeping track of things you need to do.,
You download the app and then have to upgrade and pay for something and you dont even know what it is? No free trail or notification before downloading.,
"useful to remember your tasks. User friendly. many functionalities such as priorities, tags, labels, comments etc.. keeps you motivated with the karma points system",
this app is missing subtasks and obviously no prioritizing subtasks. when subtasks are added if they ever are please make with all the primary task options and a next action option.,
This app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has. The only negative I would say is that I would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free,
"Easy to use, a simple to do list. Next step is to test Slack integration with my team. Will update after results.",
"Fantastic! Really appreciate the new sort functionalities. Excellent app, continuous improvements make app be in the top 1% of Productivity category. Thank you!",
"Great app. Keeps me organized. Can't get it to integrate with my Google calendar yet, but that's not a deal breaker for me.",
Love the app cause it is available on pc too. I have a reauest to the team. Please add an option that a task we add comes everyday.(same task every day) please!!!,
"I use Todoist for uni and personal projects, and it is the best to-do list ever! Kudos to the team who worked on this amazing app! ü§ó",
Overrated and not helpful at all especially for people with ADHD. It's really complicated to get by aswell if you do not pay for premium.,
Really easy to use...I can even check my list while on the computer... Really convenient and has helped me get a lot of things done!,
I can complete tasks without being pressured and even just jotting them down and never looking at them again can still remind me that I have to do that task.,
The best task list app on the play store.. Whenever I feel dizzy...I complete my tasks for the sake of this app atleast ... A big thanks goes to its creators...Love you all !!!,
How can i set a task to repeat daily or weekly ?? Thank you for your backup. I have another question? Is there any settings to do to see today tasks in their own project? Like a tittle and then related tasks,
Dear developer Please add 2 more features: 1. Alarm reminder 2. Duration of task and What if I want any task to be recurring but every Sunday off for that particular task only?,
very useful app. would greatly appreciate more flexible karma goal planning like finish 5 tasks a day with priority 2. ie goal planning using queries. is that available perhaps in paid version??,
"it uses an algorithm that understands your timing based on your Task. all you need to do is just write the task like "" I want to book my tickets tomorrow at 9:30"". no need to set the time nothing.",
I am a new user and have only used the app in a minimal way to date. So far I am encouraged to make more use of it to manage my tasks and appointments.,
"Great app. Synchs immediately. Intuitive. Love this app. I've tried a few to do apps, and this one is the best",
Solid daily to-do app. Especially when having the widget on your main screen to tick things off as you go about your day.,
"Really helping my mental health and self esteem journey by making my day more manageable, SMART goals are easily documented and tracked over long term as well through the projects tool.",
Awesome app. A request to the devs: I wish there was some way o take notes in this app that is linked with a task. So it will be better for future reminders.,
"I love this app so much and I use it everyday. Even on the free tier, there's enough features to make this one of the best to do apps out there.",
Love this app. If you use it it helps a lot,
"Very good app, it keeps reminding me every week to do my weekly review, and that's what I do, can't wait to actually start using it properly tho üòÖ",
Easy to use and full featured. Connects to Google Calendar and elsewhere. Project structure along with Categories and Keywords allow Flexible use. Filters allow you to Zero In on the Key Tasks and Actions to Be Aware of NOW and Here too.,
I use this to organize my study time at home and helps a lot! it's not very hard to use imo. highly recommend:),
so reminder is a premium feature. then just put a price on the app. this feel like a scam. i looked for a simple FREE application here. wasting my time.,
"This is a great app. I installed it two months ago, and I use it everyday. It keeps me awake to all my appointments, and helps me to organize everything. I recommend it to everyone.",
It's just my forth day using Todoist and I'm absolutely loving it! So simple to use plus it's really motivating. Highly recommended! üòä,
Excellent app. Tried everything and this is the best all around productivity app out there. Well worth the premium upgrade.,
"This really helps keep track of my to do items every day. I manage to the day, and not the project, and it really helps.",
"Brilliant application for to do list, notification and mail feature keeps me updated each day help me out to do my work more consistent manner. Thanks devs for this",
Would give it at least 4 stars but I can't. I uninstalled it a long time ago and it still sending me notifications? Idk if it's a glitch but it's annoying.,
"Very good app, but It would be nice if you add lasting tasks, for an example a task that starts at 14:00 and finishes at 15:00 I hope you understood me :P",
"Great organizer, however, too many features require you to have a paid membership, while similar apps don't require any membership fees.",
"Pretty good for keeping to do list - nice interface. Takes some workarounds to make it work for Getting Things Done, but nice. Thanks",
"I'm totally dependent on this app, use it everyday. I wish it was more seamless to move multiple items to the next day, but otherwise great",
The best mobile app I have ever use for everyday tasks. You can customize everything by your own and you needn't pay for it! Incredible!,
I didn't think I would need a to-do app. But it's just nicer to offload reminders. And setting tasks to stop myself from procrastinating.,
"I wanted remainder features and therefore installed it , but unfortunately I didn't get . I was totall disappointed. The screenshot showed had remainder. Please try doing them.",
"The feature of able to detect time, label, & projects on what i typed when editing tasks within inbox is now being removed (auto-detection still available on adding new tasks though) please consider to put it back",
Reminders are a premium feature? No thanks. Id pay a one time fee but subscription for what other apps do for free? No thank you.,
I like the app. But I don't like that they want you to pay for reminder alarms. I would give it more stars if that option was free.,
Best to do list app out there. I have been using it for 3 years already and achieved great productivity with it. Everything is great so far.,
This app is sooooo good for productivity. Love all the features you can use for creating to-do lists. Highly recommend. :),
"It took me a little bit to get started, but it us easy ti move items yo next day as needed. The email reminder is helpful as well.",
It's exactly what it needs to be. A good app for those with ADHD.,
"This app is making me manage better! I love it, specially when I use it on different platforms and web. I definitely suggest it to my friends.",
Crazy fun totally functional to-do-list. Good reminders for anything you need to be reminded of. Sinks with your Google account.,
"Not sure why a todo list app needs total permissions to see everything in my Google account... so no thanks, looking elsewhere. Surveillance capitalism is not inevitable, control yourselves not others!",
"I have only been using this app across all my devices for a few days, and it's the best app I have in my life. It's perfect for business and keeping on top of things!! Highly recommend üíØ",
"Useless app, I can't use the reminder. I need to pay to use thr reminder. I hope the reminder, can also available in free version.",
amazing. helpful. i use it for work and personal. it helps me sleep better because my tasks are so organized now!,
"Easy to use for the most part. The only ""issue""i sometimes have is the number of clicks required to access some actions",
"Well, it's a To Do List maker and that's exactly what it does. Love the capability of having a dark theme though!!",
"love it, takes some time to get it set up how you like but its kinda life changing when used in conjunction with GTD. Carl pullein youtube vids are great tutorials",
I love the feeling of ticking off things I've purposes to do and actually accomplished at the end of the day and todoist aids in that great sense of accomplishment. Super grateful,
"Minimalistic, clear design. Very convenient, no bugs, no lags.",
GREAT EXPERIENCE! Note for Devs: Please add true Dark Mode (AMOLED) on both the App and Widget. Options of Font Size for the Widgets would be a great bonus as well! Thank you!,
"When i type some words in the task they just disappear (eg sun) Doesnt allow me to rearrange the tasks under the project, this is a basic feature.",
"Starting last week, the app no longer work on my phone. Even after I uninstalled and reinstalled several times.",
"Still learning how to better use it, but certainly one of the best apps to implement Getting Things Done and free your mind from microtask clogs.",
I use this across platforms and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good and useful to do list app that they can use on any device,
"Fantastic productivity app. I am very suprise how it had change my habit, i am able to do more work on time because of this app. love it..",
Cant unsubscribe from mailing list despite deleting the app. Its very underhanded and for that i will forever trash your app. Give me an option to unsubscribe!!!,
Just amazing. I just want an option to set the list in order that i prefer even if I set them by !!1 !!2 !!3 or !!4.,
"Love the app. Is there a way to remove or reduce the animation (transitions, etc)? I'm autistic and they bother me a bit, I'm always looking for way to reduce cognitive load. Thanks.",
"I really like the app but I'd like it even better, if i could see all the things i've marked as ""Done"" aswell, so i can see how much I've done this day, or so",
Before I could even use the app It demanded my email and Google log in. It's a check list. I'll stick with a notepad that won't steal my data thanks.,
The thing I love the most about this platform is that you can also access your tasks in your computer. Very useful feature for when I can't access my cellphone.,
All good but completed tasks disappear when you tich them and there's no way to find them and monitor completed tasks.,
"It's a free todo app that does not offer a Reminder feature unless one pays for the ""PRO"" version. Deleting it immediately.",
"I cant live without this app, or so until and helps me organise what I need to do so well, its interface and wigets are great too.",
Everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it. A simple push notification and you want me to pay for it.,
Was extremely dossapointed when I had to give up Wunderlist and could not find a good replacement until Todoist! Literally me new favourite organizing list app!,
Best to do list I have come across so far. The way the app grasps keywords especially for setting dates is really cool.,
"That's the best todo list I've tried so far, and it 's surprsingly compatible with ""Getting Things Done"" system by David Allen. Using this is a pleasure .",
Its a great app. I am so organized now.its easy to use. It sends you a email every day telling you what you have planned,
Uninstalled immediately. It said i already had an account. I went through the entire reset process and still couldn't sign in. Waste of time,
"This app is awesome. I have a sugestion, in the app can't see the projects order by folder, will be good can see by folder",
Great app...todoist is a very easy to use and very easy to customize and set up. Highly recommend!,
It has a really useful ability to add sub-tasks to other sub-tasks. Great to use for ordering tasks.,
"Latest update has changed how to set a date and time, and it's not great. Prefer the old version.",
"Great to-do app that does everything you want, also syncs perfectly with planner for Elementary OS.",
"Haven't had it for very long, so I haven't gotten the hang of the scheduling yet. I do like being able to make projects. Nice feature.",
I love this app. If i could add contacts through sharing the app via whatsapp that would make it great... cause i dont have all my friends emails.,
Really good a combination of features that I've looked for in other apps but never found. Really well designed and very intuative to use,
"The app looks really good and it has widgets, but why can't the widgets automatically switch between light and dark mode?",
"Easily the bsst to-do list in the market. Don't be intimidated by the price, which, is pretty cheap. It is worth every single penny.",
very simple design that makes adding a task complex! also most useful features are premium.,
Has its own strengths. Not as easy and intuitive as Trello or Wrike but can handle Subtasking well.,
Todoist is an Outstanding Piece of Code! I highly recommend it!!! It dramatically reduces your stress in life if you use it vigorously!,
"Okay for making lists for tasks due same day, but not much better than notepad.. Very difficult interfacewhen creating long term goals ie not due same day",
"Very useful, but when Google keep is there as another option there isn't much competition , with keep so easily syncing to reminders in wear OS",
Latest update with lower screen controls great and hope others take this lead. Giant phones shouldn't need giant hands.,
Great app with an awesome widget! Love the projects section and the different lists you can make. Helps me get stuff done!,
Excellent app except the large widget. Is there an option to change the text size of the widget and make it a bit compact ?,
"great app, especially because of the syncing between devices! Helped me get my things back in order - seriously.",
Perfect interface that is easy to use. Just enough features for me.,
"Ive been using this for a long time and it has been a joy. However, after a recent update, the widgets stopped working. Able to help?",
Amazing app l. Helps me with everything. Good job paid features. Very helpful widget and little to no distractions.,
It was really nice it really makes me so productive during school and it usually be my reminder if I forgot to make my assignment or the thing that I have to do.,
Love this app. Makes life somewhat easier....so much to do so little time but nice to have someone or something helping you all the way.,
"Best app when it comes to organizing and planning your tasks, great UI , easily syncable across devices",
Fix this asap If we add task widgets on home screen then ..if the task is written long then it gets hide with the dotted lines .... Fix this so that whole statment shall be visible,
I have found this tool to be really amazingly useful for me. It is enabling me to get more done and also keep track of a vast variety of tasks in my work and personal life.,
"I want see my finished task in widget but I can't .I want also add some task that I want to do all days during week, but I have to add this same task every day please add this function thanks for your perfect app",
"I would rate it 4 or 5 star.. but it's just that the main features aren't free... Otherwise you can go for it.. It's an ""OKAY"" app.",
"Very good todo list program. Use it for home, work, and school tasks. Good use of repeating tasks as well",
"This definitely is one of the best app in the market. Although, it would be better if I could sync my other calendars with this app.",
"I've been organizing my life with this for years. I wish I could share lists with people who don't have Todoist, but otherwise super!",
The easy way to keep your schedule flowing and remain on time in a messy world,
a very focused goal-attainment app. it made me think about how my goals were stated and kept me honest about my work.,
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!",
These guys take theirs todo list management very seriously. But they also made it easy to use. Great job! And the free tier does all I need :),
"does exactly what you would want a to.do manager to.do. easy to join, doesnt need huge permissions or try to tie you into other apps. very happy",
I'm an unmotivated highschooler worried about scraping together a graduation: this app has helped me become more productive. It's an excellent tool ü§ô,
"Please add support to add a task at any position (something like ""add task below/above"" )this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version",
Have to pay $4/mo if you want the reminders to work. I have ADD. The reminders are the #1 thing I need in a to-do list!,
Hi this is the greatest app ever I'm using for completing task. Can you try to put Voice recorder option as well? If possible.,
I cannot re-edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it. I want to edit it from the text box not from the calender.,
"It's pretty much my one stop shop for all my schedules, reminders and todos. With Google calender sync and IFTTT I have all my GTDs here, including timely reminders to bring an umbrella to work daily if it's raining using IFTTT.",
I love the new design! And the drag-from-the-button gesture is so great! Thanks so much for one of my favorite apps ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üôåüèº,
Straight forward platform. We're all on our devices all the time anyway so might as well be productive and this is a great app to do so.,
Uninstalled. This app has 7 user behavior and personal data trackers including a few sending data to Facebook. Todoist obv has no concern for privacy or protecting users.,
Todoist helps me keep organised and keep track of various things I need to get done. It's the best app I found for doing this.,
"It is a good task manager but the font size is too small, especially in the browser.",
"It is very very easy use and after spending hours longing a to do list app , i can say this is the best app i have ever used. Download it and install it i promise you will not regret it",
"""Add Task"" button in project doesn't work unless üëâüëâüëâ With new update ,I cannot create task under any project (add task doesn't work when project is opened). This can only be achieved by 1Ô∏è‚É£ creating the task in the main dashboard and then moving it to other project which is a hassle. Or another way to directly create a task is 2Ô∏è‚É£ to open app in split screen and then open that project , then only the add task works. Otherwise it doesn't work in full screen",
"Apps like these who include ""on time reminders"" in premium are red flags for me. At least let users get habituated in your app for a week or so & then let them get premium. Why would you want to force people to get premium as soon as they download your app?",
"The tasks do not coninue to the next day, alternate day, week, alternate week etc. I am unintalling it for that reason. also removing it from my watch",
I've tried several different to-do apps and this is the one I've found that does all I need it to do. I've stayed with it and for me that's saying something. the Karma stuff is a bit silly though.,
"great app with 1 recommendation, would like to see this app also include a due date. perhaps its already there but cant see it in the widget versiin, thx,!",
Really useful for tasks but I am unsure how to repeat the tasks and feel like manually typing every day is a bit much.,
Bad experience. The support is the worst ever. And no thought has been put except for the visual ui. The ux is bad.,
"This is my favorite to do list app. I literally use it everyday. Its great, works perfectly, and makes my life so much easier.",
I like it I can plan ahead in advance for things,
This app had helped me a lot in completing my exam preparation schedule!!! I would recommend this app to use..it is very helpful!!!,
"Best to do list app, great options to personalize your workflow and organization, helps me to increase productivity and task management, customer service agents are so so sweet and kind.",
"I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it.",
"Perfect application !! It helps manage all tasks and connect to google agenda, even the free one is full of options ! I REALLY LOVE ITT!!!",
useful free features make this my go to task tracker for personal todos. not powerful enough for professional project management.,
"really really good app - just what I needed. it does have a few little quirks I had to wrap my head around, but overal very good",
"Lovely app for managing tasks and projects, with incredible utilities. The fact that it has a web-app thing for my old tablet is awesome",
"This app provides the common function of to do list. in addition, it organises tasks similar to the way JIRA does, which I am familiar with through work.",
Can't make multiple tasks of the same type for different dates. Have to do them individually which is a waste of time.,
"Just an idea, can it be possible if it contains an app block too like if we select some specific apps we wont be able to access them until we complete our to do list",
"Never had any other app get my things together in very short amount of time. For starters, I recommend using Eisenhower's matrix technique with priorities.",
it's great for reminders and for work . great app,
Love using this but I just wish I could customize the widget more like the opacity and such to make it fit my phone's theme more (I have the premium version),
"This is the best task management app I ever used! It's simple yet complete, it is very aestheticly pleasing. Recomend 100%",
To focus on studying with this app is a brilliant idea cause it reminds you to do homework even more strictly than your teachers. A must-have app,
used todoist for several years. I hate long to do lists and it helps me view the right stuff on the right day so I'm not overwhelmed,
"Great app! It has a couple things I find annoying, that most people probably wouldn't. The developer is quick to respond to any questions I've ever had.",
"I love how easy it is to add items, and that they sync across platforms and devices Also, that I can add them to /through Alexa",
"I've tried dozens of task and habit management apps, and this is the only one I've been able to stick with.",
"Very very useful indeed to keep track of all my project tasks, both business and personal.",
Really helped me to level up my organizing and productivity! I wouldn't need all the premium features really tho.,
simple and does exactly what i need it to without getting in the way. really useful for keeping on top of everything!,
"Great, simple app for managing daily tasks. Keeps your tasks in sync on all devices.",
I rely on it heavily for organizing and remebering tasks. Syncs seemlesly between all of my devices.,
Great app for managing your todo lists. Very intuitive and easy to use.,
"Great, Amazing. If keywords for Due dates, Filters were pickup list, it may easier.",
You can't set up a reoccurring routine and setting an alarm is behind $3 pay wall. Don't waste your time.,
Widget is not working. Will show up but then it freezes and you can't do much with it only remove it.,
Great app! Nice and clean UI. Very useful for monitoring daily tasks. Works awesome for some group projects!,
"If you want a quick and easy to-do list that synchs across platforms, this is for you.",
"easy to use, simple layout. set tasks get reminders tick them off. perfect",
My time management has really improved since using Todoist. I get through tasks strategically through the day and even have some spare time for me üòÅ,
Seem very friendly app. The only thing I dislike you need to upgrade to pro for reminder/alarm feature.,
"Very helpful, I really felt productive and organized. Easy to use and clean UI and designüòäüòä",
"Really like the app, and developers are very responsive to suggestions. Does everything I want a task app to do.",
Very fluid and multifunctional. A bit hard to understand at first. Serves its purpose and makes you feel good about it.,
Personally thought this had reminders I could use but cannot without buying features. Considering I have severe ADHD I wouldn't even remember to pay for premiums.,
Im loving this app! Its really helping me get organized! Im really going to need it when i start school this fall!,
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help,
Probably the best piece of software I've ever owned. Both in terms of ui / design and in actual day-to-day usefulness.,
"It is useless if you do not buy premium features. No attachments and comments, no labels, nothing. Piece of trash.",
I love this app. Its such a great way to stay organized and on schedule. I upgraded to the paod version and am loving it :),
The entire point of downloading this was to get reminders. However to get reminders you have to upgrade to premium. Which is stupid.,
there is an immediate problem: to review any of ypur completed task you need to buy a pro version. Then it is not worth to use free version at all,
so easy to use. I wish I could bring back categories I wasn't using before. easy to access on all my devices. absolutely love it,
This app has introduced me to ways to organising I didn't know exsisted. So many options! Exactly what I was looking for and more.,
"Best task list I've come across. Very functional, and I use for work and personal. Best of the bunch",
Can you please add an option to see the caledar (monthly) in order to quickly view the total tasks for the month.,
"I got premium subscription just because hiw convenient this app is! And the price is very reasonable as well- thanks developers, for giving me this opportunity <3",
I was using a different app. for my grocery list. Now I just tell Alexa to add items to my Todoist! So easy!,
"I do not understand why they do not implement start dates, otherwise it is a very good app. The reason for not doing this is not adequate in my opinion. I want to not be able to see some tasks every day and I can accept the risk from being hidden.",
"Great app, nice intuitive design makes it very low friction to use (crucial for a decent todo app), and the natural language input is fantastic",
"Super polished, quick to learn and useful app Using it to manage everything (home and work). Highly recommended.",
"This was a solid replacement for wunderlist, but it isn't simply a to do list. It's more of productive tasks",
"The app should return to the previous version when all sub-tasks could be displayed directly on the ""today"" view (right now this is only possible on a project view)",
"I wish reminders weren't just a premium feature, they should be a basic feature. Everything else is fine.",
Updated review: the developer helped me out in an email exchange so i can put my review back to 5 stars. Haven't been able to find a better to do app than this one.,
I renewed premium upgrade. You now have my money and I don't have access to my created projects! This is one angry customer!,
"I love this app. I may not use all the features but there are some great features that I use everyday, I really think this app is worth a shot for anyone.",
"Most often used app daily! The most reliable, most used app on my phone, laptop and desktop.",
Keeps my entire life organized! I love that I can access the app on my phone and desktop. Definitely recommend!,
"The whole point of such an app is reminders, they are paid features, that's okay. It's very expensive.",
"Please, make an option to use the old style widget. Unfortunartely letters became too small for 4x6 home screen grid.",
Excellent update. Thanks Todoist team. I would suggest customizing the font size on the widget as it seems small.,
"I do not appreciate the automatically added tasks. Also, I cannot save a task unless I am in the middle of editing thd tags which is not helpful",
Filters stopped working after the latest update. Logging out and logging in back fixed the issue.,
I love this app with all my heart :) it is absolutely perfect! Thank you for creating it! Stunning work!!,
"The App was really amazing but it keeps shutting down everytime I open it, I have tried to re-install but was still unsuccessful",
Best To Do(L)ist app I've found yet. Customer support is quick. The latest UI is ü•µü•µ Appreciate the free features! Kudos to the Team.,
I wish i could see completed task in my list just tick or cut off. I don't like the fact that it disappears to completed section,
"A ""free"" app that charges for notifications. Basically useless if you're unwilling to pay.",
"works for my girl and I. she's a planner and I'm a doer, so it saves us the long beaurocratic meetings about what needs done and instead of TALKING about tasks needing completed, I just DO it, which is more my style.",
"Capturing the gold. So good to have a means of capturing those fleeting thoughts throughout the day, which sometimes lead to gold.",
"used to be my favorite apps, but sync bugs drove me crazy too many times, auto replace link with title made me mad, cancelled subscription & uninstalled",
I've been researching To-Do List apps for myself and clients for years... this is the absolute best!,
"I've tried a lot of organisation apps and this is my favourite, just really simple, easy to use and effective.",
"I am a busy person with lots of different responsibilities: three jobs (including a business co-owned with my wife), three kids, church, and a doctorate program. Todoist just helps me find some order and not go insane.",
"Incredible. Takes some up front effort to learn, but I now organize my entire life with this tool. Seriously.",
I love it. it's amazingly helping me organising all my tasks and life. Moreover it is make me becoming more focused and reliable,
This app helps me plan my important tasks and keeps me reminded when needed but the only thing is that there is a problem with setting manual alarms for certain scheduled tasks,
"Love it, used to use Asana, Toodledo, Trello, DGT GTD but this app does it all more easily, quickly and cleanly. It basically organises by life now!",
I find Todoist so easy to use. It is so straightforward and useful. the application is very effective and well laid out. I'm so glad that I have it.,
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved.",
"It's really good. I dont want to have to pay for premium and I wish I could see the tasks I've completed, but at the same time it works really well for what I need it for.",
"In my opinion is one the best todo apps that I ever download on my phone If you ask me why I think so? Because for me, firstly, in todo apps only the incentive to tackle the task matters to me. That's one of them",
"A brilliant little to do manager! Check out the free version, then upgrade if you like it.",
"Extremely complicated to use. can't understand a thing. good app, but it needs a whole tutorial because it does so much",
Subscription model for to-do list? Are you a joke. Upd: figure out that most of the things are not hidden behind paywall change from 1/5 to 4/5. Still can't justify subscription model,
"Just uninstalled it It looks a great app, but one its fundamental features (reminder) was available only in premium mode.",
This used to be such a good app until they implemented a poorly thought out sort functionality that renders any 'living' list almost unusable.,
"Easy to use, and I love the way reminder pops up on the screen everyday and doesn't let you forget your duties!!",
Great app. simple but very effective. being able to use the app and the online version interchangeably is very useful,
"Great app, easy to use, you can schedule times and create priorities. I highly recommend.",
Tried as few. Todoist works the best for my needs. Love the Alexa and calendar integration.,
Very intuitive. The integration with google cal is the reason I came back.,
"Good overall user experience. It was unfortunate they removed metric tracking, however. Otherwise, great.",
"Intuitive UI, very easy to use (though difficult to master!).",
"The best to do list app ever, I already had used others, but no doubts this is the better, minimalist, simple and faster!",
I love it! Would just be great if it also had a function where you can see your tasks in Calender format,
just started. great so far. better for college than chipper if you make each class a different project.,
"tried a few of these apps, this one seems the most intuitive and feature rich. has a linux desktop client too, community maintained",
"i like it because i can just put down my todos as they arrive during the day and organize them in my calendar later. as suposed to seting it all in my calendar, wich takes time",
I'm a grad student with lots of tasks and like time. Todoist helps me to effectively manage the little time I have.,
"I've only been using it for a week, but so far it has been fantastic. I love the design, and more importantly I have been significantly more productive since I started using Todoist.",
Loved Todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me. Can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore.,
"It's a good assistant for daily life. But I don't like, that in there's a premium upgrade for money.",
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.,
My favorite app on Android! Great planning app. Fast bugfixes. Often new cool features appears.,
Great for More Productivity,
Okay I was happy until the sound on my in app tutorial did not work ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Of course with assistance this review can change.,
Have to have this for the edge bar panel which I purchased now I have to purchase this to use the specific features I wanted for the panel. Should be more upfront about these things people.,
"Love it. It's bit annoying that windows desktop application is not working but otherwise, it's awesome.",
"it technically does most of things you would want a list app "" to do "", but it seems to make them a bit tougher than other apps, or charges",
"Actual dogshit, spent a good portion of time setting up tasks for it to be all deleted the next day, nice job with the unintuitive menu",
"i like this app but the real reason I'm leaving 5 stars is in an attempt to stop it sending me notifications asking if i like it, even after leaving a 4 star review!",
My organisation skills have never been as good before I used this app. Its on all my devices. Makes sure every day of the year is not wasted,
"i love this app so much, helped me to finish my tasks on time way better! people who have a hard time trying to organise their tasks should try this app!!",
"One of the best apps I used in my whole life. Superb, thoughtful, subtle design makes you want to use it, and this is the key!",
Using the free version which is very good! may update to the pro version for the premium features! Definitely recommend,
Started using this app years ago in Chrome. Simple to use and does what you want with great flexibility.,
So helpful! Love the latest update that lets me indicate a completed task in one click. I depend on this app.,
"Its good for making lists, but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium, its just not for me",
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled.",
I been with out the Alex integration for a loong long time. I just got so use to using todoist. Now I'm moving to any.do and back with the Alex integration. Bye Todist!,
"i wish it supports smartwatch os as well where i can add, complete and modify the tasks thru my watch.",
The best to-do app,
"Optimal for work and private, a good Tool to stay on track while your 100 Tasks are burning your head. Write them down in todoist",
"Amazing app, after using tons of todo apps, I'm sticking to this one, checks all the boxes for me.",
"I couldn't figure out a way to sync with my Google Tasks, and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch.",
best app . and a small request that I want a reminder for my tasks because reminder is a premium version.. üôèüèø .. I like this app but more than other app ..üòäüëçüèª,
"excellent detail, organization and support in managing the details of life. also good link a d coordination with calendars.",
I've tried a lot of task tracking apps! Todoist have every essential function I love all combined in one app!,
"Difficult onboarding, no integration with google calendars, documentation is not very clear.",
It's a good app love the simplicity and layout of it but I don't think reminders should a Premium feature.,
Great app to keep you organised. Love the integration with Google calendar which ToDo doesn't have. Easy migration from Wunderlist.,
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...,
"Good, simple, clean, fast and easy to use, i prefer to choose a cold color like sky blue or turquoise because cold colors are more comfortable and calm",
"The widget stops working suddenly and doesn't show tasks. It says ""no tasks. Anything to add?""",
"Nice app, useful and easy to use. The free version has lots of options to serve the goal.",
"Had this app during college and it great to quickly add in things to do and also to have schedule projects, very clean and easy to use",
Near perfect app for boosting your productivity. I love it despite the developers breaking some features while updating.,
It is a nice app. But I don't like the fact that an alarm is a premium feature. But other than that everything works fine and great!,
"the only thing im not a fan of is the fact that there is a premium version, id prefer all to be free. however the free features are still supurb!",
free version has a lot of functionality but i do plan on paying after a few weeks of using it... just to see if i will use it consistently,
"I use premium! It has really all the features you want from task manager: GTD support, tags, hierarchy, Google calendar integration etc. Great product!",
Amazing...keeps on task and love the ease of using this ap. Love the Karma levels...makes motivated to get more done. I will reach Enlightened!,
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding me? This is an absolute deal breaker. I deleted after trying for 2 minutes.,
brilliant app and easy to use! have premium as a free trial but will definitely be paying to keep using it!,
"Love it. Has all the features i was looking for, yet still easy to use and available on all platforms.",
"love it, highly recommend it. it makes my life so much smoother, very easy to use and clean interface.",
Awesome app.. nice and simple to use. It really makes my to do tasks easy to manage and gets things done.,
"It's simple and to the point, but has the power to get complex when needed to. Loving it right now!!",
Good app but not very user friendly. Reminders behind a paywall and no way to repeat tasks :(,
very nice even in free version. I wish though that free version would have more unlocked features like comments and stuff.,
why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date? i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date.. can this be fixed???,
"Great, intuitive app. Helping me with time management and productivity.",
I like the regular updates. It shows that the Todoist team doesn't stop trying to make the app better.,
"great app! Really helped me feel happier and more productive! Makes it easy to plan out your day, week or even month!",
Easy To Use! I've been using it for the entirety of my college career. So easy to use and helpful to not have to carry around a giant calendar.,
It can not even start normally: Im clicking loflgin via email but nothing happened. I can not trust productivity app who fors not work from the beggining,
Excellent app but expensive - Charging an annuality for a service very similar of what Microsoft To-Do is offering for free now is something that needs to be considered.,
App sucks. Will not open. Kind of hard to cross off items from my to do list when I cannot access it.,
Very helpful tool for clearing my brain so I can focus on what is most pressing in my week with less mental fatigue.,
"So, when will you guys add a ""do when"" feature as well as a ""due date""? Like Things 3 has. Can you please consider it? Perhaps something similar?",
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review,
"I love this app. It's easy, intuitive and makes managing a schedule very easy",
"I would much appreciate a ""for later"" category for tasks that I have to do, but I haven't decided when to schedule them. like in the app anydo..",
"Simple, intuitive and yet quite useful. Oh, there is also no ads.",
"I would give todoist more than five stars; However, you keep ignoring users for enabling them to show completed tasks by default is just irresponsible, please add an option to always show completed tasks!",
The app keep crashing everytime I tried to create a label. But the app look interesting. Too bad üòî,
"Easy to use, would like to have desktop version that will sync with mobile.",
5 trial projects... There were much more and than they reduced the amount of project to increase sales. Also price is too high.,
Wished there's pomodoro timer function like ticktick or focus to-do. Hoping more features will be added on premium.,
Love this app was using a planner but I'm 100x more productive it's super simple but also very complex at the same time learn new things about it all the time 10/10,
Very useful and does the job. It's a shame some features are in the premium version.,
Missing the possibility to easily enter repetitive tasks without having to put the same task every day/week/month manually.,
"Has been the only app that had helped keep me organized, I have tried many, this one is very flexible.",
"Alexa shopping list integration is rubbish, items are added correctly but if an item is removed by another user they never leave the list.",
"Super useful, have been using the free version for a few weeks and feel like I have more control over my schedule.",
Thee absolute best task app I've ever used. Does everything you need and more omce setup with the GTD (Getting Things Done) principles.,
Almost perfect. Has some annoying quirks but it's the best task manager I have found so far.,
Make the program free without any pro features And then make a lot of people happy,
Great app. Helps me organized. Would love to see a better UI. Great app overall. I would keep it installed,
Excellent. Changed my appreciation of how much I can achieve in a day. Truly a game changing app. God bless you all mightily in Jesus name!,
Very nice format for constructing to-do lists. Have tried many and this is one of the better ones.,
"It's okay. Easy to use, just wish incould add a topic/note header toneach individual note.",
Best app for productivity boost. You have only what is needed in a really simple to use interface.,
"Highly recommended to focus attention in the many roles we play each day in our work, family, and personal lives. Suggestion for users: Add a task to check Todoist with #daily!",
Great. But it would be nice if the Android app icon had a count of tasks for today like the windows version.,
this app has been so amazing I paid the extra for premium and to be able to ha e scheduled push notifications. highly highly recommend!,
good app! I guess I miss some of the premium features in my free version but that's the order of things üòã,
This app is really useful. This app had helped me achieve more productivity. Loving it. Best for students.,
"Great app, ima kid. My family makes me watch videos about jesus each day and I do online school. There could be improvements but it truly is a great app.",
"Good, but you should allow to set default date to tomorow when creating new task. I schedule what todo usually the day before.",
"Wonderful app across all devices, not much is behind a paywall. Best free to do list with great integrations",
"super helpful, easy to utilize, smooth navigation. a great asset to any job.",
"great app, dinged 1 star for cost... but perhaps worth it as its the only wear os watch + mobile seamless integrated to-do/ task app there is.",
"The best. No matter what device I'm on, I can capture every idea, every thing to remember, and find what is important to do now.",

"great app ! i find the widget really useful and also the features , they have a stufent discount too which is awesome !",
"Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders.",
"Very easy to use, nice, simple interface. Nothing to extra",
No free trial. Notifications don't work. User interface is not user friendly.,
"easy to use, fast enough to set tasks but simple features are put in premum mode.",
"This app is useful and make my day productive , it should have voice listening so that we'll just have to tell our work and day nd time nd it will automatically schedule than it will become much easier nd convenient",
Not bad but keeps on deleting my recurring tasks... Which makes it unusable for me. I need something to remind me of it... Not to be adding them daily,
I paid for the subscription and now it doesnt show up under manage subscriptions for me to be able to end my subscription!!üò°,
"Very. Useful user friendly app to organise meetings, handy reminders to keep you focused.",
"It's helping me in my day to day activities, and facility to add subtasks and daily mail update makes it more valuable.",
"Good app, but lots of stuff was pay walled. Worked fine, but there might be a better option for free somewhere.",
The app is very good and literally helping me to stay productive and record my achievements and to stay aware of what I want to and but I have a concern is that I love to see the analytics of my work but in this app I am not getting in the more analytic like I want my monthly analytics just like there are day analytics for days and B okay so my basic concern is please add more analytic,
Does not let you use reminders in free version which should be a basic necessity for any productivity app!,
Why Free features like alarm are premium now ? Can't find widget and after leaving from the beta the install button disappeared. It's been 1 day I leave from beta testing,
It's a great app to chart your productivity.... Simple easy to use features make it all the more accessible.,
Great! Really intuitive interface and the natural language comments work like a charm :) very happy!,
So helpful. Keeps me organized and i don't forget anything and the tips and blogs are also really helpful. Love it.,
reliable and easy to use,
My favorite cross platform ToDo app by far. Alexa ToDo integration is great and sharing list with family members is the icing on the cake!,
Great app. The best thing is that you have both calender and to do list on one app. But can add Persian calender as well?,
"Free version has some limitations, but great productivity app so far--longest I've kept one going on the phone yet...!",
This is the absolute best todo app or website i have ever used! It has so many great features to organize tasks.,
The free version has a minimal functionality. There more advanced free apps on the PlayStore.,
"Todoist is really useful if you have a variety of tasks that you need to carry out, but don't want to write it down on pen and paper.",
This is the best app when it comes to to do...the free version is ok...,
"I need an account to store my data on your server? no local copy of my data? I can't work on my data offline? you want a monthly fee to retain my data? sorry, I need an app where I retain control of my data and you can't see that data. sell me an app, not a subscription service. uninstalling.",

"Integration with Outlook, web browsers, and other tools really makes this the best activity tracker I have used.",
"I love this app! I use it to keep track of all my assignments for my college courses, as well as to keep up with maintaining my daily life.",
Highly recommend if you're like me and have trouble remembering things. Just waiting until i can afford premium!,
"Despite its bad UX on the web (e.g. it's a pain to add tasks to projects, Trello-like shortcuts would help), I like this app a lot!",
"that doese what it says, even free version gives plenty of options. can share a list among others and keep track thank you",
"This is amazing, it has been helping me to keep track of what I was supposed to do according to the plan that I designed. Thank you for making me be mor focused on my daily routine!",
Great app to organise your days in tasks by the hour! Very useful for busy people that wanna keep track of their productivity.,
Requires a sign up/login. How about an option for offline only. If an app requires a login it gets uninstalled immediately.,
"Easy to use, quite intuitive and not littered with advertisements. Win-win in my book.",
"I have tried a lot of todo apps. This app have everything i need, eccept making multiple list... Instead I have to make multiple projects.",
IFTTT integration makes this the best talk management application available. You can shorten the usual long Google commands to be short and sweet making among notes to TiDoist with your voice a breaze,
Its been 2+ years i am using Todoist. Thank you for this amazing app. It boosts my productivity and help me remember my tasks.,
Easy to use and great format with different levels of importance and goals to keep you on track,
"It's a great app for keeping me focused. I use it every day. I enjoy the karma levels, too. it makes everything feel more like a game.",
I like that you value privacy. So I'm disappointed that tasks within a project can't be broken down into more tasks. The comments feature doesn't seem to be enough of a supplement.,
"Recently moved from Wunderlist to Todoist. Very pleased with Todoist, especially the recurring task feature.",
if we could input estimate hours and actual hours for each task. and get summary on finished tasks each month. that will be perfect.,
Excellent. Very helpful with keeping track of things and is a perfect online checklist in my opinion,
"Not compatible with older Samsung tablet. What a crock, it's a to do app. Explain why Wunderlist can run but not this app...",
"I wish i could have started using this app earlier. This app is freaking so good. 10 star This app should editor choice app Genuine review Abhinav From india Just one request, premium version side little bit on pricey side. I can understand developer cost. If price is reduced, more people will start opting for premium side.",
its great to keep track of the things you have to do and it allow you to seperate things by projects.,
Incredible app. It's really helped me be a lot more focussed and productive with work and general life.,
"Using the app solely for daily tasks (creative work, exercise, cleaning). Works well enough for that.",
"Nice app, decent sublist setup, yet a little confusing, possibly me not understand doing his it works. Good app, just not ready to pay at this time.",
I use it every day to organise myself - couldn't do without it. The best organising app that I've found.,
Satisfied. But to me too little functions for free version. I'm not able to judge whether I'm ready to pay for full version,
"I love the flexibility of this app. There are a number of ways you can choose how you see and enter info, yet it is very easy to use.",
its really good for reminders of some important tasjs and for creating a daily to do list and tracking one's progress and dedication towards his/her progress.,
this does not work im a student and i forget things easily so yesterday i put task and add them for today and they werent there so after that i added a task today it aint show up so 0 stars.,
Their team won't add sorted by date ascending/Descending or created date of task since 7 months ago I created email their team about suggestion. Bec it's lack of focus without this.,
This is a very simple and powerful self-managemnet tool. I can add a new task at anywhere.,
Three stars because we can't set time to get a notification from a task. Please add that option even for the free users,
great for planning!. I was the caterer for a memorial reception. Todoist helped me to outline event and prep schedule to deliver food for the event. Love this tool!,
"It has helped me so much with school, and the google calender integration makes it even better. Thank you!",
Very intuitive interface. Love tracking tasks in it. Fun!,
Great app so far. It does some stuff that I'm not crazy about but it sorts thing well and keeps track of everything I need it to.,
Excellent app. Helps me to organize my day and remind all activities I have. Works good online and offline.,
The app's not opening. It always is having an error. Each and evrytime I'm installing it.Pls look into this problem.,
"Easy to use laid out to be user friendly, mixed bag on email reminders. All in all a helpful application",
"Does exactly what I want it to do, it's easy to use and a good reminder for my various taks and errands.",
An essential part of my life / brain. I especially rely on the widget to quickly add tasks.,
"Would loooooove the option to be able to add items that are not necessarily tasks, just notes I don't want to forget.",
"This is a great app.I use the free version, I know there are many features that I don't get to use due to that fact, but it does what I need for the most part.",
"Great organizational tool, really helps you define the steps and timetable for each of your goals.",
Easily the best task manager. And I've tried about 15 of them. Even works with Google assistant.,
Really like it. I can organize all of my tasks easily and across platform. Keep up the good work,
"Intuitive, easy, and motivating! Great to use on multiple devices",
I hate that marking a task as completed doesn't automatically mark the sub-tasks that were part of it as completed too.,
Riddled with bugs and the UI gets more and more unusable as time goes on.,
"I very rarely leave reviews, but this app has had a dramatic positive influence on my day to day productivity, I highly recommend it!",
I have tried many to do list apps. But this is the best. Just renewed my premium subscription,
It opens but won't let me add the to do tasks I need to keep track of. I uninstalled than installed pocket brilliance which is close to perfect,
So far everything has been working well. I don't really need the premium features so everything that's available for free is just enough for me.,
"Love the interface. easy to organize with combination of projects, tags, and priorities.",
Im in love with this app soo much .but one disappointment is that it is not fully free .i was ble to put only 3 projects.but daily use of this app is perfect.,
Excellent! I found it really convinient to be able to edit my to do list both from my phone and my laptop.,
"A very helpful app. I'm using the free version, it would be nicece to have an sms type notification system.",
integration with Google calendar is pretty good and combining that with a pomodoro timer is great for productivity.,
The app is good but 50$/y for premium is simply ridiculous. So frustrating to have to move to another app.,
The most well rounded task manager app out there. Premium necessary for most features but is well priced for students like myself,
Todoist & GTD methodology has completely revolutionized my life and my way of doing things. Forever grateful for this software and the GTD methods that it helps me apply.,
Overall the best to do list app to organise your daily schedule. Actually helps in easily completing the task.,
"Todoist helps me to manage my tasks and to control my productivity, especially I really like collaboration feature. Good job guys.",
"One of the best apps ever, I've tried plenty of to do apps but using todoist for years I simply cannot live without it.",
It's a simple to-do list app. Exactly what I needed. Without annoying adds and very simple,
"Very helpful with creating tasks, prioritizing, and execution. Great tool to have for organization!",
Latest update has broken the app and made it unusable. Creating a task makes the app crash.,
Update: Recent version 9498 has bought the app back to its reliability on older Android versions. Thanks for your persistence.,
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.,
"An app the puts me on the, with Todoist I break down big aims into small tasks per day helping me enjoying the progress Its the best out there, after I've tried several",
"Ultimately the best to-do list. I've been using it since years already. Highly recommended. Noone paid me to write this. I pay Todoist for Premium version, though.",
"Sorry but I won't install this app before you do install it check this app and privacy concerns, check under the tab about this app permissions and you can see that it has more or less acces to all your phone's information that sucks no thank you.",
Very confusing User Interface I tried to add a few tasks but so its confusing I decided to uninstall it and not to mess it anymore.,
"Reminders are a PREMIUM feature for some ungodly reason. They are a must for a todo app, what's point of writing it down if you keep FORGETTING it?!",
It spams your mailbox with reminders and it isn't obvious how to unsubscribe. Not very user friendly. AVOID.,
"Very useful. One can make tasks repeat, and rank them based on priority.",
On the free version. Very intuitive and has made a difference to my organisation. Thank you!,
My go-to app for taking note of my college assignments and exams! I won‚Äôt turn back to any other app cuz Todoist is just THAT good.,
The free tier is close to useless and coming from Ticktick I found Todoist pricier and work fewer features.,
"Found something that works with me, not against me. I'll never find a perfect solution, but I keep trying and todoist is the closest to my ideal method.",
Great app over web and mobile. I love the ability to sync with my Google Calendar!,
"Best task manager I have used. Simple, straightforward and works seamlessly across platforms.",
I just want to put a time in the task without it triggering the date function... it's too good at its job,
Love Todoist. Use it every day on desktop and phone. The widgets could be better but the app is amazing,
Need to pay to get reminders? The whole part of a to-do list is too be reminded. It's so pay to win =/,
"A lovely nice looking interface but one that isn't cluttered and confusing, just what I want in an app like this",
Nice and lightweight tool for my personal project and weekly todos. Some small ui quirkiness which is only why I don't rate it 5 stars.,
"Pretty good app, but crashes sometimes if you do something unexpected EDIT:contacted you with a crash description",
Amazing App. Does exactly what I need to capture and organize all that I need to do as an executive.,
Great app. I use it to remind myself of payments i need to make. Very simple to use and also handy.,
Good app too organize yourself. Not spammy. I get one notification a day. One in the morning and thats pretty much it,
"Great App! Purchase Plan, i.e. subscription, the necessity to subscribe guarantees that I have no way to have it.",
"Powerful and flexible, Todoist has the best feature set of the various productivity apps I've tried thus far",
"This is the best app for task management. I love the UI, especially the dark mode.",
"This is a really good app, the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do.",
First day of really actually using the app and they want me to rate it. so far the app works good. I haven't used it much at all.,
A really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it.,
The Best! No doubt this is the best todo management app. It has all the features I want. Todoist has the best UX!,
"Great app, switched from iOS to android and the app I used before isn't on android. Minimalist is great, I think this app is a step ahead.",
"Worth every cent. I don't regret paying for the premium. Being honest, this app is an essential part of my productivity.",
"Vry good app, tho I was just deleting one of my tasks at night and almost got a heart attack from the sound it made 3 seconds after üòÇ üòÖimma find out tmrow if theres a setting",
Very helpful for school and organizing. This has been my go-to app for the past few years <3,
Good way to organize all my tasks. Love the rescheduling option and weekly view !,
"Game changer. Most productive I have been in years, primarily use the upcoming view and schedule tasks.",
"I tried several To Do List apps, and I like this one the best. I especially like the option to assign priorities.",
Easy to use and helpful for keeping track of my schoolwork and personal goals.,
"Would like more options for when I can view things but overall, one of the best productivity apps on Android.",
"Back to being the best Todo app. Had some issues in the past updates but got fixed very fast with this update, good one!",
Best app of all time.,
"Great, but lacking moments feature - still you can simulate this technique by adding recurring tasks which remimds me to review my todo list",
Great. Minimal. Sublime.,
Great app to organize your tasks and plan your day. I'm very satisfied with the premium features as well.,
"Stops midway, no response for days.",
"Looks good, works well (except on windows) and nice calendar integration.",
very good app.,
Gets the job done. Simple and highly efficient - no learning curve.,
Use this app to keep track of all my school due dates - simple app I can access from anywhere. Love it!,
Easy to use. The layout is good. I used this app for homework tasks and errands at home.,
Quick and simple to use. I especially like the long press on the app icon to add a task quickly,
"It really has a minimalism design and functionality, as I prefer to be. Helpful app, thanks devs!",
Gets the job done very well! Helps keep track of things necessary and streamlining is awesome!,
"This app was so amazing. I don't feel disappointed after downloading this app. Actually, it is simple and great. Keep up the good work. (Sorry for my bad english üôèüòì)",
I have just uninstall it cuz you have to pay to get the basics options. If i can give it -5 stars i will do it. shame!!,
It's disappointing that basic things like reminders are a paid feature.,
"What good is a todo list app without a reminder, why would you make the most important thing a premium feature. Don't download this app it's USELESS!!",
I'm using this app for a few week now. It's the best app I've ever used for my to-do lists and schedule. Beyond my expectations.,
"Brilliant App, seems extremely intuitive, i find using this app keep everything organised which helps with busy lifestyles.",
"I find the app very comfortable and easy to use. I recommend using it, as it very meaningful and helpful for me!",
The only task management app I have been able to use for more than two weeks. Now at 4 months. Love it!,
"Great I'm still working out a solid work flow, but there have already been drastic improvements in my organization and productivity",
I've been using this for years and it helps me stay on top of my daily tasks! I would give it 6 stars if I was able. Definitely recommend this application.,
"First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app.",
"Doesn't display instances of recurring tasks, making it totally useless for forward planning. Uninstalled.",
"it helps me to manage our day to day things.& also didn't let me to forget things that I have to do. thank you & a better app, so anyone could have this.",
Downloaded to test alarm /reminder capability but was unable to trial without paying. Come it wouldn't kill ya to offer Pro features for a week,
"Exactly what I was looking for. Free version is sufficient for most use cases, and the full version is great!",
There are better options available. I just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app. I tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and I am going to try another.,
I only use it for simple reminders and lists but it works great and syncs across all my devices,
Adding a picture to a task is a paid feature... So free version is not great.,
it's been a best app to keep track of the planned task. I have been using this app for more than 5 years or so. I couldn't use and found any other app like this.,
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme.",
an amazing app. very well built and really helps my productivity. I highly recommend you give it a try!,
We use it for running our home & project improvements. It is easy to use.. not as user attractive as some but ok.,
Already such a great app and then you guys release more premium features for the free version. You guys are the real MVPs!,
one suggestion: allow the return key to work so as to make a vertical list under one entry. Other than that it's üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,
Looks great but reminders need a pro subscription. This is what I basically wanted the app for. Uninstalled it.,
"Haven't tried it yet, but give me some time to analyze it's performance.",
Great app! I use it every day. I use a list for everything. I love having different types of lists too.,
Had to use email or other login to start using. Not great when i want to see if the app is any good. Uninstalled instantly.,
"App is good, but it's stuttering in my phone. Kindly update it and make it smooth.",
useful so.... way to schedule and add i often do .. reschedule stuff. keeps a good running list of this things i need to get done,
So far so good. Helps organize my scattered thoughts and keep track of what I should prioritize.,
"great appüíñ but I think more can be done considering aesthetics, things like making the home screen widget transparent and so on :)",
Very good. It's worth using properly. Take a little time to learn everything about it and you will find that you have more time and less stress.,
"Simply the best organizer app I have ever, ever had. It changed my life forever. I just can't say how greatful I am for this app. Thank you!",
Great app. Wish it would sync with a few more business tools but it is a great organization app.,
"Such a nice app to keep you on track every step of the way, too bad half the features on it are for paid subscribers only,",
"Just started using, really enjoy it the more and more I organize my projects. Will update again in future.",
Full power app! Sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own. Otherwise amazing.,
Good app for keeping track of things. Wish it'd be easier to make notes on specific tasks.,
The Android app is a bit buggy: when switching view the task list remains frozen on the previous view until you scroll or tap.,
"Just needed somthing to record things I have to do and to remind when I should do them, then got hit instantly with a paywall, not a cool start tho.",
"Quick to add to dos, organize them and move them around. I'm quite forgetful, and this keeps me effective.",
Great app with a simple to use platform. Keeps all of my to dos in priority and organized for a steady productive day.,
"Very simple and intuitive. Easy to organize, and clean ui.",
Delightfully clean interface and a great range of features even in the free edition,
Love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now I do not get reminder for anything on time.,
find the reschedule function especially helpful. it's been a superb tool so far.,
"Team , I took subscribtion but app is not working. I try to add task but I can't see the text etc. Something is wrong.",
Really enjoy keeping track of my tasks so easily. Fills my need for accomplishment by checking off completed tasks.,
"This is a wonderful app, thanks to which I became very and very organized. I am grateful for its creation to its developers!!!",
The best productivity app ever used. My day starts with this app. Well designed and continuous improvement makes it the best app.,
I use the free version and it's very easy & helpful with adding tasks & reminders.,
"Easy, useful app that connects all my platforms. Makes connecting in the business a breeze",
"Very good but could be better e.g. sync with google calendar, tag people in tasks (not just on shared projects).",
Very good and practical to-do list app. I am using the free version and it is doing what it should perfectly.,
"It's a great app! But the main thing is, it is easy to use. And also, it automatically recognises the date I have set. So, I'm giving it 5 stars.",
Great app. Used it to run projects at work as well as day - to - day task. Have great control regarding day.,
The app is good. But I am unable to sync it with Google calender on my phone. Please help,
Werry cool app to memorise things that you need to do. I recommend this app for everyone that don't want to write tasks down on real paper.,
"Its a great app, but I can't give it 5 stars because the app asked me to rate it and I don't want to reward that behavior. Devs if I really want to rate your app you won't have to ask stop begging me to rate your app. Cut it out.",
Unhappy with the paid version. The reminder function isn't straight forward and hasn't worked for me,
A beautiful piece of software. It's only downside (which is an upside to some) is that it's SaaS.,
Widget buttons do not work,
Solid to do list app. Even at the free/intro level I don't feel super constrained.,
"simple, easy to use and not bloated with useless options or features. I love it!",
It's great at organising my project's tasks for home DIY and helping me get a lot more done in a note efficient way.,
I have uninstalled this app and unsubscribed from emails and yet it continues to send me emails. FIX THIS AND STOP SENDING ME EMAILS!!!,
I'd like to try apps that don't require an initial log in to see how to use.,
I'd like a faster option to delete tasks instead of selection and using the side menu.,
I've tried a bunch of to-do apps and this is my favorite to date. Versatile without getting too complex.,
Thanks for this very helpful tool,
It's great both as a free user and premium. I've tried both. My favourite app for keeping all lifes task on,
Condensed widget is amazing. Really good use of the space and a confirmation popup to prevent misclicks.,
"It's got a lot of features, even though a lot is in premium it's got everything to keep everything organized.",
Very easy to use and the best app in this category. I had this app on iphone and now I install on my new android. Todoist makes me an organized person :),
Love it. Recommended by a class I took on productivity. Huge boost to my planning and way lower stress.,
"Best ToDo list, has projects, priorities and integrations like Google Calendar sync. Use it daily and love it",
"Like it, helps me a lot. Just sometimes it opens on Today despite my project is customized as landing page.",
"Good app, I have used it steady for a couple of months now. The filtering feature is handy",
"Todoist suddenly starts reminding me that I have no tasks for the day. I have all notifications off, stop that!",
Great way to track personal projects and be motivated to complete the steps. Really love this app!,
Really nice app. Very user friendly. 5 stars when subtasks are usable (when I can view them on my daily task list),
Seriously? Reminder is a premium feature? What's the point of all this then? 1 star. I can understand comments and labels but reminders? At least other paid apps give reminders.,
"good clean app, would be nice if there's an option for loopable tasks (daily/weekly/monthly/twice a week)",
"Best ToDo app from the ones I've tried. Elegant: everything you need is there, but there is no over-functionalization.",
Todoist is very intuitive and resourceful! I'm really enjoying my experience with this app!,
Very functional and well designed. Actually aids in getting tasks done.,
Firdt of all thanks a lot for the app! Would be great to have an ability to create subtasks for todays tasks.,
i hate the checkbox so much... Please make an option to remove them. Totally ruined the old nice swiping experience.,
Widget does not sync to app. The app was listed as not-optimized as well.,
I wanted to try this as an alternative to Any.do or Microsoft ToDo but it's a joke if a basic function like a reminder is a paid feature.,
"Hands downs, without a doubt, the unequivically best task management app available; full stop.",
"This app is a surrogate for my memory. I'm using the free version, and it's been extremely useful so far.",
"Please make your widgets follow System Dark Theme. UPDATE: Close they have ""Dark Dynamic Color"" but it still doesn't change depending if the device theme changes to light or dark automatically.",
"In use for over 2 years, it has all functionality needed for slef organization. Thank you.",
Latest update has made the app practically unusable. Constantly crashes when actioning any item.,
Great experience. I will have love that there will be an added feature to have notes against task created or completed.,
"Users are choosing privacy more, so should this amazing app. It's got Facebook trackers embedded & no focus on privacy. It should be implemented.",
Super useful. Templates for recurring projects are an awesome feature.,
I would probably call to do as the second best task application there's definitely a lot of room for improvement.,
It has no option for offline mode without account. You have make account and things to get started.,
"A pretty easy way to keep track of tasks and set reminders, whether recurring or not",
Ease of use is fantastic. Helps add some organization to my schedule without much effort.,
This app options is more than other similar ones specially priority but there is a problem that would better if you add timer or focuos mood,
"Exceptional, really helps track objectives and goals in a clear way.",
"good application, the free version is very limited since most of the functionality is in the payed version.",
"If you are a free user this app not suitable for you, because the most important thing ""task reminder"" option only for premium user which not available for free user. Most to do app give this option for free user üôÑüôÑüôÑ",
Great App so far! I only have a question: Is it possible that the completet tasks don't disappear when checked?,
"Best to-do app ever. Easy to use, easy to organise. It clearly made me more productive.",
Keeps me structured and organized. Premium is definitely a game changer.,
"Still figuring it out and getting in the habit of organizing myself, but I love how I can break down projects or task",
Solid to-do-list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7-days ahead. The best app in my opinion,
"Great app, seamlessly syncs with the PC app as well. Very well polished.",
it is still killing my time.,
"Custom Filters, Labels, Comments and attachments ARE THE PREMIUM FEATURES with around ‚Çπ3100 per year... I wasted my time by downloading it.",
This is an idiotic app. First asks fkr all details including email. And then sends lot of junk mail. Uninstalling it. Nothing special about it.,
It's the best GTD based time management app out there. And it works fine across all platforms.,
So easy to keep a list of everything from work and home together and section them out. I love it!,
I'm new and still learning. It's a great app for planning your daily schedule. enjoying it so far.,
The to-do board is an absolute must for productivity gains. Loved the UI üòª amazing job from the Todoist team üí™,
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.,
"One of the most overrated to-do apps. When I point out the issues, I receive cold response.",
"I can no longer get reminders with the free version, which makes this useless to me. Currently looking for a new app to use...",
"Awesome app! Smart natural language syntax support for task management, cool UX and multi-device sync.",
"Still getting used to it. I prefer typing tasks in on my laptop, but really like that I can see them on my phone when I'm out.",
"This would be a fabulous app if you could set tasks to reoccur weekly, monthly, yearly. Ugh!",
Love it! Allows me to write things down as they come to me then prioritize and schedule accordingly.,
It was a really good app you may add reminders and if you didn't it from time to another push a notification for you,
Great way for me to manage a time sensitive workload for multiple design client's and keep my home life organised at the same time.,
"Its the most amazing app i have ever come across , helps with managing and organizing tasks , its awesome , ddefenotely recommend it ,,,",
I've used several and this is the best I've used. Clean interface and every feature I want.,
Simply the best planner. Love it to the core. I have introduced your app to over 2000 students we train across various mba colleges in India,
Desktop version is great! Mobile version is almost as good and I use both. would recommend,
"Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects)",
This app is completely amazing. Many colleagues in my workplace use it. The pro version is worth it.,
Ok. Not as easy to add a project after task has been entered. A little clunky moving task to next day.,
really like the app a lot. the projects make it great to organize a bunch of disparate things,
Most features gated behind premium. UI difficult to use for setting recurring tasks for a future date.,
Amazing app. Such a simple yet brilliant idea. I've already seen a huge improvement in my productivity.,
"I like this app, but maybe you can add some schedule like note, not just to do list",
It does not have a language change feature But it is good in other respects,
"Oh God, I was searching for this for so long, and I mistakenly though any.do was it, and I remembering it just not being correct. Here's to hoping, this is just as good as it used to be! :D",
This is a great to do list app. And it sends reminders so you don't forget your tasks!,
It has been very helpful in getting to set and achieve the various tasks and reminders I have!,
"It is really an awesome way to clear your mind and to make sure you never forget anything, big of small.",
it's an awesome app I just wish that it would work better with Google. The system for creating new tasks using ok Google could be a lot better.,
"I first used to use this extension on my laptop, but I found this app, and I was delighted!they both are very nice.",
works very well. would like to see an option to make more than one list and choose which one to display,
"Love it. It's simple, but just the thing I need to keep my to-do list written down and handy for easy access.",
"eventhough i am disable and terminal, todoist allows me to be productive. I can not tell you what a wonderful gift that has been to me. It pushes me to live life to the fullest! I praise God for this program ... there is life after a career. Thank you!",
Helps me keep on top of everything I need to do. I especially like being able to organize my lists and even color code them.,
"Great application, use it from mobile, home and office desktops. Also sharing from Microsoft Teams is very useful",
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue.",
"Loads of features, everything you'd need in a todo app, very critical part of my life and managing my day to day chores as a brain injury survivor.",
"its just good. stick to it and you will see results, and see how much more time you really do have!",
Can't even use labels for free - it's a premium feature! Uninstalling on principle.,
Very basic. No reminders in free version. Useful UI though.,
"love the simplcity and intuitive-ness of this app, the layout makes it easy to use and helps me stay organised",
The best app ever !,
This app is such high quality in its usage and visual design. It's on par with the quality you'd expect from Google.,
one of the best ToDo/Task list apps i have ever used. it seems to do it all! BUT TOO EXPENSIVE,
"Long time user. Works well for my use case, which is mostly basic to-do-list, but also GTD method.",
"an amazing app, helps me keep myself organized while I'm under severe pressure from university and work load.",
Is a great app to help you keep track of your schedule and also help assist with breaking down tasks on projects üòÅ,
This is really good how it links into Google calendar.. keeps me on track with random day to day jobs id otherwise forget or be late with.,
it has a user-friendly and super easy interface. kudos!!,
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists,
"excellent. free app that syncs lisys across browser and phone, works oretty seamlessly.",
"Easy to use, great repetition features, helps me keep my tasks in sync between my desktop and mobile",
"Has every feature I need, basically the ultimate todo app! I loved the syncronization with Gmail and Google Callander.",
"obsessed with this app - with the integration with google calendar, keeps my entire life on track. 10/10 would recommend",
Love having Google assistant integration (through IFFT) and being able to share lists. My two deal breakers!,
"Superb to-do list that is so much more as well: project manager, business planner etc. Highly recommended.",
Use it every day to organize my life. It is easy to use and synchs with my Google calendar.,
Splendid app that I believe has the perfect mix between utility and simplicity.,
Great transition from our beloved Wunderlist. All tasks imported and now enjoying additional features offered by Todoist.,
"This app has changed how I manage my life. I am less stressed out because I can keep track of everything in one place, and I can feel at peace at the end of the day.",
I'm only a week 1 but so far it's been very easy to operate to go in to make changes. I can't wait to figure out how to use it to its fullest!!,
I never got further than the first screen because I don't see why I need to login with an account to simply make lists.,
"Excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment, reminder etc are locked on free edition",
This app is great but can you please add a Black amoled theme,
Does everything I need it to do. I like the natural language code you can use to set up repeating tasks.,
Sync across devices easily and quickly. Easy to create lists and love the layout,
awesome!!!!! i use this app everyday. it keeps me organized and i get so much done. I love checking off things on my list!,
Simple & easy to use. Task capture is excellent. Super easy.,
Great app. Can you please add transparent widget show that it will cover my full screen and look good with my wallpaper?,
"Best todo app i've ever used, and has helped me with alot of personal and professional work.",
Really enjoy the simplicity of this tool. Great for organizing my thoughts and actions.,
Excellent. Is so helpful helping me out with the reminders and I love how I can schedule things for future days as well,
"No easy way to import or export tasks in a non-proprietary, other app (e.g. Google Tasks) compatible format.",
"Can change the layout for Android tablets, it would be much better than now it is. It's good and I like it",
"There is tricky way to crash the app: delete task from widget, tap ""recents apps"" button, open an app (infinite loader is here), tap on three dots menu.",
"First heard from Tim Challies in ""Do More Better."" Very helpful productivity app. Use with browser on laptop too!",
"Good alternative to clickup, notion etc as far as personal productivity hours. Good for eisenhower matrix lovers.",
This app is so easy to use. I enjoy finishing my tasks a lot more. Really boost my productivity,
I think if there was a bit more flexibility wi5h how you can combine multiple deadline dates then it'd be 5 stars.,
"Handy tool I use daily. No ad junk interferences, simple, clean. I recomend for ppl who like simple.",
"This app is ok, but it really needs start date functionality. Their reasoning behind not adding it is terrible.",
"I think it's a bit silly that reminders & labels are premium features, but other than that: great app!",
it helped me to stick to my newly formed habits and organize my daily routines. thank you!,
Fixed the crashes - works perfectly now. Can't remove my earlier review for some reason.,
Reminders locked behind pro version so this app is useless to me. I will not pay for features I haven't had a chance to test.,
"The best time management app 3 years using it and it keeps me organised,efficient and productive.",
"good üëç, meets my expectations",
"this app is good, but I would like it if you guys could add like shopping list to it, and not just to do list. :)",
"The unpaid version is still useful enough to be beneficial, and has been a great help in managing my tafe assignments",
"I absolutely love the GUI and widgets, keeps everything organized and in my face. Exactly what I need",
I use Premium option for 2 years and I really like it. Simple but nice application.,
"Pretty much perfect. Love the natural language pickup mostly, feels great to use.",
Not as advertised,
"Requires a login to function, making it pretty clear what they're in business for. I'd rather pay for the app.",
It is good but mobile app doesn't have many options and many features are not accessible to free users.,
"I am really enjoying this app...only complaint is I am not sure how to make a list, within a single task, but that may just be lack of knowledge on my part",
this app saves time and is convenient to all students or workers. I absolutely love it!,
"Two word - Paid mess. Please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice , just go for a better app.",
"It's so easy to work with todoist as a planner , but I just have a tiny problem. Where can I see my completed tasks? Is there an option to make them visible?",
Perfect balance of useful features and a minimalist interface.,
I've been using Todoist for years. It's lightweight and does everything intended well in a simple way.,
Love this app. Use it with the chrome extension on your laptop to quickly task email follow ups and project goals.,
Love all the ways to categorize my tasks. Also great that it integrates with my Google calendar.,
"I wish there was a way to check the things you've already done in a day, but it's still a great app for what it is. It's a to-do list and it feels good when you check off an item.",
Very useful app for managing school work and long term projects. Highly reccomend!,
Top notch. Simple and effective. Wish it integrated with Google Assistant.,
"The monthly payments make the application a bit expensive, but the functionality is great",
"You cannot sort list in alphabetical order! That's a very basic feature, seriously?",
"I really like how they register tags like 'Something to be done everyday', it will take everyday tag and will actually remind you everyday.",
Easy to use across all devices. Helps me keep track of my dozens and dozens of due dates a month.,
Really helps me keep organized and on-time. This software has become my everyday tool.,
So far so good. I've not used any other function besides listing the activities and scheduling.,
Limiting sections is ridiculous .... so if you want to add things for 30 days you need to have seperate projects.,
Monthly sub for a reminder feature is laughable. App is totally basic with no features your basic note taking app doesn't have,
LOVE their open API which lets me automate and add my own features. It has completely chsnged how i organize my life.,
"After the latest update widget stopped working. It's blank (have no tasks) all the time, no matter what I pick. Latest version + zenfone 5",
Thank you for this great app! Is it possible to force RTL layout in the list items that appears in the widget?,
An excellent online to do list that updates on various platforms. Very pleased with it.,
Awesome! Finally found what I was looking for and it's straight forward. No typical bait and switch,
Very useful task manager. It's really intuitive and simple to use.,
"the UX for selecting date/time is terrible! otherwise, this is the best tasks app.",
"Stupid app. After you created list of tasks, it will be removed then they will ask to restore if you buy the premium license. Fraud!",
"It really is useful I love the interface itself, really is straightforward and aesthetically pleasing",
It is a good way to keep track of what needs to be done. I like the features that allow me to prioritize tasks or color-code projects.,
"Simple, modern, easy to learn application. My productivity soared with todoist.",
Great app that helps me organize and track the many projects and tasks I have to manage and complete on a daily basis,
"Looks great but no option to save to SD card, and I need phone space, so have to uninstall.",
Free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done.,
"Overly complicate, have to pay if you actually want to get reminders. Waste of my time!",
I love this app. It syncs to google calendar and helps keep me on track with tasks.,
"It keeps my life organized, and gives me a sense of accomplishment know if to do items.",
"Great app, easy to use. Would love to see the addition of Defer/Start dates like OmniFocus has.",
Great tool. Enough functionality to adapt it to how you want to manage your day to day.,
love the app. but could you give the option to toggle whether you want tasks of sub projects to be displayed or not?,
Its perfect for student's like me who take every day as challenge and tend to forget what's important each day.,
Great app for getting things off of your mind in order to stop having to constantly remind yourself of what you have to do and when you have to do it.,
"Honestly, the price point for premium is a no brainer. Combined with free toggl account is just about anything you'd need",
"Really like this app, even if you chose to stay with the free version it's a hell of a useful app.",
Amazing amazing app. The UI is so convenient. I maximised my productivity in a month with this app.,
Its a really great app to keep track of your activities especially if you have trouble with staying organised,
To-Do List is much better now and wish it would and will help me on my Schedules and reminders. Thank you Todoist.,
cant change my email it just gives me an error message,
"Helps me get more things done, very useful since I have ADHD, which can REALLY get in the way of being productive",
Finally found an easy to use to do list app with all the functionalities it needs. Very satisfied with this,
Uninstalled for only 1 reason. It syncs only alexa to-do list and alexa shopping list. Does not sync custom lists created on alexa.,
I liked the markdown support. Links editing in WYSIWYG mode is a total disaster.,
Life saver! This app has been a great help in increasing my productivity. Well organized and easy to use.,
Very useful app in managing tasks and getting them completed in timely manner on regular basis.üëç,
"Best to-do app I've ever used. So simple, yet so effective. And the dark theme is just something I cannot live without.",
I am trying to login from my mobile device but unable to login through my email it's only working with Google Apple and Facebook. Look into this matter please.,
Fantastic app to set up repeating tasks. I love the interface across phones and it's web site,
"Its practical, intuitive, well designed. They obviously have good product managers",
This is my preferred app for managing my priorities and obligations. This app is simple and has a very clean user-interface,
It helps me keep up with daily chores. Having the reminder emails is a plus.,
Please don't install the app. Their use and keep your email to send spam if you already unistalled their app long ago.,
Made life simple....awesome app. Does exactly what I needed. Simplified my day to day appointments.,
"Super cool App that allows you to plan different activities with couple, family and friends!",
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding?? I've never deleted an app so fast,
Great task list app. Would love more customization options with the theme colors and font/UI choices.,
"Straightforward goal-setting, considering upgrading to premium because I like it so much.",
Very efficient way of organising notes and keeping track of what tasks have been accomplished.,
Not too complicated like clickup. The basic functions are enough for me to stay productively..,
I really enjoy the simplicity of this app! The sub-task feature is very helpful.,
This app is very useful. It divides your whole day into multiple tasks to make the day achievable.,
I have found this app to help keep me on track throughout my workday and reminds me to do things for home as well.,
By far the absolute best to-do app! The free version is great and the paid version is even greater!,
"Easy to use, intuitive, simple interface, effective.",
sync is a nightmare. email support just going in circles. basically a broken service.,
"Quick to add and complete tasks, effective reminders, good integration with Gmail.",
"This is a really good app, always helps me stay organized. I 100% recommend this app, you will love it,",
This app and platform works wonderfully. The user interface is friendly and easy to navigate.,

"Pretty cool app, simple, does what's intended to. Wish I could plan longer more easily though.",
I very appreciate that this Todoist app can really assist me to make important things done! Thank you! Let us have a wonderful summer!,
Use to be my favourite app but I can't recommend because they don't send you a notification when a task is due :(,
"I've been using it for several years. I wouldn't change it with anything else. Very stable, fast and easy to use.",
This app was great until recent update. It now crashes regularly and has become unusable.,
"Tried a few different personal productivity apps, this is the first which feels like it will stick.",
My favourite to-do app of them all! This one isn't complicated at all to use so it makes me want to use it more!,
Keeps me on track with all of my many projects and the minute details of things I work on. =] I really have a lot of projects!,
First task mgmt app that I have used almost daily for 3 weeks so far. Very easy to use.,
Loving it! And I can share different projects with different people. Pretty awesome!,
No integration with Google assistant. Will probably leave for more integration of hands free control.,
"Very effective app, works across platforms, simplify your life, outsource your short term memory",
"Everything is good but there is a minor bug while using the widget, i hope you guys will figure it out soooooon...üòÄ",
"When the virtues that set it apart are premium-only features, there's no incentive to stick with this app.",
Please solve bugs. On android I cant see any projects. Something went wrong after the user interface changed:(,
Very helpful for reminding me that I haven't done certain tasks and keeping me doing things I otherwise might procrastinate over.,
"Absolutely beautiful app. I couldn't do without it. Well done guys. And the best thing is, it is always being improved and updated. Love it. Cheers",
"Really intuitive and clean interface, much better than Microsoft To-do",
"I started a new job as head of the department, and had no organizing skills. This app has changed my life.",
LOVE this app! It helps me aave paper and I still get the satisfaction of checking my to do list boxes!,
One of the best to-do list apps i have used.,
"Best to do list and project management in the market, and the paid version really worth it!",
I don't use most of the app features but the widget is really nice for quick notes and reminders,
Finally a to do that really makes life better. Accessible from everywhere with great UI,
"Great app, I use it daily and find it very useful. I have tried many ToDo apps and keep coming back to Todoist.",
"amazing app tbh, love that it's available on both pc and mobile. features are extraordinary and easy to use",
I have legitimately been more productive since using this app. Very appealing design and solid user experience. üëç,
so far so good. upgrading makes it easy to use additional organizational tools.,
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634,
Really easy and great that it links to my pc. Just what I needed to try and get organised!,
It's flexible when I'm on a creative streak & easy when getting out of bed is a task.,
I had a real improvement in my workflow some I've started using Todoist. It became an essential part of my daily organization.,
Getting works done thanks to this app! scheduling tasks both individual & project groups is super easy üëè PS this apps Ui is better on iOS than om Android,

"simple, clean interface, awesome for sharing tasks with others on collaborative projects",
Perfect - does everything I know to want and I keep finding features I didn't know I wanted until I saw them.,
I really like the widget feature with that so I can put the to-do list on the first thing on my phone it's really nice,
Great app supports cross platform and overall great experience and and one more thing it would be nice to have shared labels,
The widget does not function with respect to updation and also no function works properly on the widget.,
"Great to-do app, I truly adore the whole ui/ux. Super smooth, intuitive and extremely useful",
"Switched after using Google Keep for years, and it changed my life! I'm laser-focused and productive now :-D",
It does pre-loaded tasks that can't be removed and it's not free if you want ut to set a reminder you have to pay for pro,
"Exactly what I was looking for, simple, intuitive, unobtrusive todolist",
It's wonderful for keeping track. Even the free version contains so much!,
"App crashes constantly after latest (Feb 8 2023) update. Was an excellent app before, please fix!",
todoist has made me feel more productive than ever before. have been using todoist as a college student now for a year and I love it!,
"great overall, some annoying bugs in the automated but over-zealous scheduling algorithm",
Some premium features should be free ! Otherwise good tool to manage one's projects.,
Great app to help keep me organized. It's become a regular part of my day. Highly recommend!,
"it's the best to-do list app i have ever used, i used to use wunderlist, evernote, keep. but none of them is better than todoist",
Overall it's a great app I just wish I could link it with my Google calendar or that it worked better with Google assistant,
Just the thing for this ADHD adult. And the premium features are well worth the price.,
love it! use it as part of my t r o system. especially love how I can link tasks directly to open emails.,
The app was doing well but it doesn't let me order the tasks in the way I want.,
This is an excellent app with good integration with gmail and is an apt replacement for the native google tasks app.,
"free, syncs lists, intelligent... nothing more was needed. Love it!",
"first login and the app keeps stopping after not even a second, have unistalled and downloaded the app again still the same problem",
so simple so effective. add the widget click plus add a task. click complete from widget too. changed my life,
extremely annoying multiple Popups to get the full version when creating a quick (!) task,
"It's exceptionally good app, i can reach it from my pc, mac and phone at the same time!!!",
I love having a widget on my phone where I can keep track of important things. I use it to keep track of bills and their due dates.,
Great everyday tool.. Have been using it gor almost 2 years now and cannot imagine being without it.,
"A lot of features, have not explored them all. Thus far very helpful.",
Overly complicated. Overpriced. Paid for a month. Wasted money. Need a manual to use it.,
Go for Microsoft To-Do list. It offers everything for FREE and it has also has native windows app.,

"I live by this app, never forget a single task but the alarms rarely go off on time.",
I really like how it walks me thru becoming productive and learning how to prioritize with the tutorial.,
"really helpful, enjoying having my work much more organised and less daunting! thank you todoist people, you guys are ok!",
The one change I'd make... I wish I could change push notifications to only show tasks from certain projects,
Free version is great! Syncs up 2 ways with Google calendar which was a must for me.,
"My life is definitely going smoother wuth this app.even the most basic functions are useful, lots more to explore",
the app is awesome and does exactly what its supoosed to. the only flaw is in the operator.,
"Great experience so far, I have been using it for almost 2 years and it helps me not miss a task !",
works good! nicely persistent in reminders yet unobtrusive to be able to continue to focus.,
"Stupid app,even a reminder which is pretty much basic is under premium useless.Don't waste time in exploring this.Just go to any other nice applications",
"Works really well: simple to use but if you want, there are a lot of features you can use!",
When I open app only black screen appears and after sometime it shows the app is not working Thank you for fast reply,
Best to do list app I have used. It has all the features I want and works the way I expect it to.,
"Very good, but I'd like to be able to set a specific time in the day to do a task. But I love that it's ad free.",
I prefer Todoist over all the other tasks apps. Being able to connect it to Google Home is important to me.,
Best I've ever tried! You can stay organized as simple as black and white. It gets me.,
I'm using it daily since 3 months. I enjoy using the premium version as it is very handy to use.,
"Looks like it would be a nice app, but basic functionality like setting a reminder is an in-app purchase",
No longer useful. Task reminders are made premium feature. Moved to TickTick.,
I use it every day! it's great for keeping track of everything I need to do. Organized and easy to use: I love Todoist.,
Not for me. I couldn't get the integration with Google calendar to work. I only need something simple.,
"It's great. Sucks that you have to pay before you can access most of the greatness, but it's great.",
"Todoist is a clean, easy-to-use application and the Android app complements the web app perfectly.",
Love this app. The best organisation tool I've ever used. Would like to see a calendar view,
I use this daily. Very user friendly. Good repeating and postponing features.,
"Awesome app!! Theres so much u can do, so many features...way more then just a ""To-Do List""!?!",
"Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks",
"Reminders only available on prime if you purchase it. Nice way to catch you, be careful.",
"love the interface, the aesthetic and the functionality. I endorse this app.",
"The reason for 1 star rating is , there is no notification feature . At least give a notification feature for free",
Todolist has helped me organise and manage my work list very efficiently. Highly recommended!,
"This is a great app, it has made my life so much easier. I have tried other apps but this one has to be the best one so far. If you are thinking about getting it you should.",
Greatest scheduling app I've ever seen used. That's why I paid for annual subscription.,
It's very easy to add tasks with its incredible Natural Language Processing.,
Super easy to install and use. Highly functional free version with integrations üëèüèæ,
"Great productivity tools i use it with my linux desktop,please add feature pomodoro timer for tasks with statics it will be the best app.",
Honestly the best app I could ask for. Managing and completing tasks in a form of projects.,
"Easy to use, compatible with Wear Os. Use it as daily apps for tracking my task & really love it.",
So helpful for my productivity. really helps me stay on top of all my jobs and sort them into areas so I can juggle work (multiple jobs) and home and everything.,
"Awesome app with great features and user friendly interface, definitely recommend it 100%",
"Close to perfect, and I appreciate the integration with Microsoft Outlook.",
Very simple UI and great experience. Great work team todoist üëç.,
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?,
I don't understand why the changes I make in this app don't sync with Google Calendar. What am I missing?,
"Easy to organize with due dates, categories and sub-tasks.",
Very good task manager. Works on all popular platforms. Has good free plan.,
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.,
In order to get reminders (which is what a to do app is for) you have to pay for their premium subscription.,
"good but no reminders in free version, sole purpose of to do is getting reminded of the stuff we need to do.",
Brilliant app. Has given me greater focus and helped me reorganise all the jobs in my life. Great job üëè,
"Needlessly complicated and doesn't do reminders. If I remembered what I needed to do without reminders I wouldn't need a to-do list in the first place, would I?",
Who wants to pay $3 a month? The free version just tries to upsell you the premium version while you're trying to use it.,
Excellent to-do list application. I came from My Life Organized; I just need something simpler.,
"I really like this app! Wish it also had pomodoro timer like feature, have to use another app just for it.",
"Definitely worth the money for premium, it's built for organizational people (or disorganized people trying to get organized)",
One of the best investments in my life so far. This app really helps to offload things which need to be done from your head.,
"Not easy to set recurring dates or access calendar, interface looks good",
"great app, just wish for the ability to integrate with my calendar and send reminders",
Everything I need in a home and personal project management app. Not too complex but not too simple ‚ù§Ô∏è,
Clean interface. Excellent work flow. Intuitive.,
"Will be really helpful to mark a task as cancelled, for future rafferance, rather than deleting it or change the labal. Thank you!",
"What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!",
"It does everything that you can expect from an to-do list app, help me to be much more organized.",
"If we complete 1 task through widget, it close all other tasks already shows in widget. Irritating.",
Todoist helps keep me organized and productive. I highly recommend it for a to-do app.,
Microsoft To Do does almost all of this for free. It is pointless to pay such a hefty sum of money for these so-called premium features!!!,
Instantly uninstalling after finding that just adding a reminder is a premium feature.,
"Be a Do-ist!! Organized My life a lot. Even in free version, you can enjoy a huge utility.",
I tried a number of todo lists. This is by far my favorite. I keep it open on my computer and phone all day.,
I would use the app but it's a paid app and I'm not sure of its true value because I haven't used it. How is it better than keep or others that are (for lack of a better description) free.,
"$4 per *month* and no reminder functionality without it? You're joking, right? One star, uninstalled.",
"The widget doesn't work, I am not able to modify anything through widget",
"this really helped me get my work done, i can always trust it for a plan in a time crunch, when i need to just SPLURRRGEE my brain snot into something that could be productive",
"Great app, lots of useful features. Helps me to remember what I need to do throughout the day.",
Love it. Best way I have found to capture all aspects of life and keep my mind clear.,
I use it for over 2-3 years and really like it. Love the new boards too.,
This has been the most useful app I ever downloaded. Very easy to use too. I paid for the upgrade. Well worth it!,
Absolutely amazing. Really easy to work and the Karma points motivate me a lot.,
It is a smart click in mind...üòç üòé‚òùÔ∏èNow I am able to perform my tasks in an easy way.. very smoothly‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è..! I love todoist...üíûü•∞,
Well designed app / desktop task list. It is very customizable.,
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc",
Everything I clicked on its for premium account. That means I cant use it smoothly for free!,
"App works smoothly. Though I'd like if ticking a task produced a ""ting"" sound.",
"The idea of the app is great, but many services are paid. The free version is more limited than I thought.",
Great easy to use list making app. Just wish you could print lists,
"I like the fact that I can make a list, some call 'em projects, multiple lists of whatever I need",
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked,
I like using this app. I would love to see a sync between devices in future.,
Sporadic. Doesn't show notifications anymore. Only when I open the app.,
Upgraded to pro and never looked back. Single most important app on all my devices now!,
Its cool but ive been using it for a week now but sometimes i forget to check my tasks in-app dont know if it will become habit eventually or if i nees a reminder for that as well,
It is well organized and perfect for quickly recording homework for school.,
"Neat, does what you expect, with handy reminders and useful organisation of projects.",
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.,
It does what I want it to. Plan and get tasks done. Not overly complicated by things that I don't need.,
Pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added. I dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me.,
"It's a really great all, except that you can't make it buzz when you need to do something unless you pay.",
Truely exceptional app for staying organized at work and at home. I'm a Todoist for life!,
Excellent app. But... According Exodus contains 5 trackers. Come on... 21 century. Privacy is matter. Only 3 star.,
It's been an amazing app so far especially since I'm starting college and helping me organize my monthly drills,
Very intuitive UI and nice for the project management!!! Recommend! ++,
Reminders shouldn't be a paid feature. Basically undoes everything the app does well.,
"the best app Ive ever used for this. love their chrome extension. simply fantastic, might buy premium",
"Easily one of the most important apps I have in my aresenal. It seems simple, but wow is it powerful.",
Easy to use but some features are not clear. Nice dark theme.,
Why can't I reset my password no matter how much I try? App interface is good but so lagged and buggy.,
Wow after the last update i lost everything. All my notes. Insane. On samsung galaxy s21+. I hate it.,
phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer,
"Really great app! It's been few months I've switched to this app, and I haven't looked back",
Extremely helpful app! the interface is great and quite intuitive!,
Great UI. After trying other task management tools this is one of the best so far,
Just what's needed at times reminders until tasks are completed. Good idea.,
This app does not have reminded option. If we want to use remainder we have to upgrade and asking money to subscribe. So it's useless app,
Todoist is user friendly and it is really working for me in the way i like to schedule my tasks.,
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!,
"I love this app, using it for a while now, and I would love to continue using it, but since the latest update it constantly crashes. I can't even open it. Not sure what to do with it now...",
Strikes a good balance between being both feature rich and elegantly simple.,
"Since I usually have my phone nearby, this app is the easiest way to capture my to do thought as it comes to me.",
Helps me stay on track. Has reminders for tasks which I find invaluable.,
I need more details about the advance of the projects also a difference between a complete task and the death line (thanks for answering),
Best reminder app on the market. Easy to enter dates and times.,
Best thing is we can track the tasks completed on a particular day. I used it as result scoreboard,
this was the best ever app I used. I was never used to be productive like this ever before.I am achieving my daily goals every day. I am becoming different human being every day. thank you,
Great app! Even free functionality covers almost all my requirements! Kudos to developers!,
"Very nice working space, but the display of things can be a bit nicer.",
"Great To-Do list app that handles reminders well, it is perfect for my needs.",
"I just loved it, it helps a lot and you can implement your own organization system or prove others",
"works fantastic. effective and easy, lots of productive features. 2 thumbs up",
The widget feature is great. Everything can be done through that.,
"Good App does what it says, sometimes the inline text recognition dosen't work like it's suppost to be.",
I've used todoist for years. From time to time I've tried other systems but I keep coming back.,
The best and easy to use. Great widget. Very helpful for planning days,
"using this app with GTD method has changed my life. I am now more productive, more focus and less busy. thank you",
"It still says Todoist has stopped working ,was looking forward to the app,I'm very much disappointed.",
"Excellent! Does what it says on the tin, is easy to use and is definitely helping me keep track of everything I need to do",
"Even the free version is very useful! Great app, pretty clear design.",
"brilliant, simple and totally changed the productivity of my day to day life. 100% recommemd this app",
Great app. Simple and clean without sacrificing functionality.,
My husband and I are using this to stay organized through a move to a different city. It has worked out great!,
"Amazing, couldn't do without it! I use it for my personal to do lists/notes.",
I have been using this forever. The best app to get stuff done. I use it for my personal and work life. Kudos to the Todoist team!!!,
The tools that reminds me my todo list. Love sharing with my partner as well.,
"like being able to access my lists in different places, and that I can have multiple projects. I feel I'm getting more done",
"Super great app, drastically improve my productivity until the reminder feature was moved to premium... ‚òπÔ∏è",
All functionality comes with premium account only... Shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version,
"It works well, but please make it for free we can't enjoy the full app unless it's fully paid.",
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app,
Most simple and excellent solution for task and time management.,
Really love the app. As it keep me on time and improved my productivity too.,
"Love it, but definitely needs the ability to sign into multiple organizations.",
Difficult to add items and navigate,
Great Todo app that nearly and visually groups things .. found it incredibly useful and would recommend,
"the beat application which I use on a daily basis for more than 2 years. thank you todoist, team",
Great experience. Great Interface and excellent system of Notifications. Thanks,
"Easy to use, integrated well with other tools and very intuitive, great app",
Literally the best to-do app. SO WHY IS IT NOT CONNECTABLE WITH GOOGLE HOME? Singlehandedly ruins my use for it despite the fact it's simply better than every other list app out there.,
Without it I would be a lost and stressed professional... For me it's an investment for my mind's health,
"quick, easy to do list generator. easy to add, easy to reschedule.",
Great app. Too bad they're now nagging you in the app to rate and review them. Otherwise super useful.,
very complicated to use. can't make my own personal task by deleting the tasks already updated.,
"I love the app, help me to organize my whole life in a minimalistic way.",
It's been a while since I was this impressed by an app in such a short time. It's not even been a week! Amazing stuff guys!,
I really like this app but I wish it had the ability to set progress on each task.,
Everything I was looking for! Great way to track tasks and progress.,
Lol how dare you. Use Microsofts to do list instead everyone. This app charges you an insane amount for reminders. Greedy developers. Microsofts note application lets you do all you want including reminders and they do not ask you to fork them cash.,
I highly recommend this app if you have an ‚ú®attention disorder‚ú® it is wildly useful if you can find a way you like to use it!!,
"I love this app. This app makes my life easier, but i miss reminder feature in free version",
"Great app, super easy to use and keeps me organized with my college workload.",
Game changer. Best app I've used. recommended to many and one of the few apps I have happily paid for.,
"Recently upgraded to the paid version, and found it's even more helpful.",
Nice widget. Syncs across platforms well. Easy to use online as well.,
"Even the free version is awesome, i use this app everyday and it really helps me keep organized",
"ToDoist is a good thing but...did they really need to add the ""Karma"" function? I don't think so. I know how the actual concept of karma works. Life itself will ""punish"" you if you don't do the things you say you want to accomplish. If you don't have the drive right now to do something, maybe figure out why. The concept of Karma in an app, giving you more productivity guilt isn't going to motivate you either way in this case. I speak from deep personal experience.",
Reorganize my whole calendars tasks and keep in one place. @todoist app rocks for teams work and play!,
"Clean UI, ease of use, every functionality you need. Best todo list app ever",
My push notifications doesn't work promptly. I change my phone and then also its doesn't work,
this is a great app. simple & intuitive. just how i like it for productivity apps. thanks @ dev üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç also AD free which deserves more star!!!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,
Fantastic task tracking app. I've been using it for years and it keeps getting better.,
Simple easy to use not only helps with to-do lists but tracking your limits/habits ^^,
The full version allows you to do this. On the free version once you have completed a task you cannot see what it was.,
Great task management app but keeps crashing after updating a task or two.,
To do list app with lots of functions and integrations. One of the best,
Very very good app.. Free version is enough for small to medium companies..,
"Reminders, the MOST important feature, aren't included in the free version.",
outstanding fit making a task list. have been using this over my bullet journal and so far so good.,
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.,
"not exactly great for work, but perfect for civil life. has windows mac droid iphone apps. bit too simple for my taste.",
great app ! super easy to get into. the swiping function is very satisfying!,
"Nice app, i would recommend to anyone who wants to organize there day and get more done.",
I have tried many different to do apps and I haven't found any other that fits my needs as well as Todoist. Good job!,
Awesome productivity app. Filtering and tagging in the premium version are especially useful,
"User friendly and although my needs for an app like this is basic, I am totally happy with it.",
Perfect to do app. Integrates with my Google home. Thanks so much for this smooth slick app.,
Love this app üòç great switch. Such an easy app to use even with just the free features!,
"Useful features ask you to get premium version but when I try I get to this page, which is the app I already have installed. 1/5",
The app is great but atleast you could have added reminders in the free version.,
"So far, it's very useful for staying on top of my work tasks. I also appreciate the email reminders.",
"Good but I think this application can improve, for example i want to see total table with a calender",
"Very useful application, thanks! Could you please add tags grouping? Because I have created multiple different tags and now it is really mess!",
"awesome app to keep track of home, school, and work. I have it on my phone and my laptop and it's perfect.",
"Great app, with well thought out details. It has really helped me get a handle on all my tasks",
Free version is no use and I'm not paying for an app I can't try before I buy so I'm uninstalling. Sorry developers but not for me.,
More features now in the free layer. Basically all I need for a to-do app.,
Very simple and clean UI. So far would recommend to pretty much everyone,
Great product. Efficient and easy to use. Would recomment to anyone.,
"Great app! One of the best things about it is that you can run the app on Linux, iOS and Android, which works great for me.",
"Great app, I use it everyday!",
"Excellent application, I have been using it since 2013 with premium account.",
"Great app, it resolved half of my couple issues. I would definitely recommend it.",
Exceptional organization tool. Helps keep a bird's eye view of all open projects.,
It is goed better than I expected their windows app is bad but we all have a browser so that is not sometging bad.,
The first to-do list app that makes me wanna do stuff instead of making longer and longer lists,
Fantastic integration with Alexa. Any errant thought immediately makes it to my list.,
"Todoist is simple, customisable, and helpful app to get things done. Must have app for Productivity.",
Does exactly what I need it to do with an enjoyable ux/ui. Good integrations for my needs.,
"I liked this app because it has a computer version as well, however it's a shame you have to pay for reminders as that's what I need",
I love this app! It has made my life 100% more organized and helping me get things done.,
"Really great, but please add some more dark themes with different colors!",
This app is great for what it does. I just wish that reminders weren't a premium option.,
"Great app! Very easy to use, would highly reccomend. No ads or pop ups! :D",
"Very good app, smooth, organized, and functionality is amazing.",
"After extensive testing, the best one for me. I wonder if there is some easy way to create subtasks on mobile...",
Best to-do list app ever,
great app for tracking your progress and keeping on top of your tasks.,
Great app and it is way better than your regular reminder application. Gonna start using it for my daily life routine,
"Amazing, this is the app I've needed! Haven't even dived into all the features yet. üôåüèª",

"I'm loving your app, it's my humble and kind request please Enable feature of seeing Completed in free version üòä‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you for this amazing app :)",
simple interface and programing to keep track of your task and organize your day.,
"great app. But, you have to purchase the premium to set a remainder for your task.",
"Updated review -- Todoist fixed the issues I had complained about, and is now a 5-star app for me. Thanks!",
Best tool I've found for staying organized and making progress on goals.,
"Dev's response resolved my query regarding auto-change of date from the use of keywords like ""yesterday"" or ""tomorrow"" in task Perfect to do list app",
This app is amazing! It's really helped me streamline my productivity! Definitely recommend.,
an excellent app for organising your life on the go...,
That's amazing.... I used this app in 2014 and today I just installed it again and it still remembers my tasks in 2014.,
I love the fact that it syncs between devices! Overall great app!,
Easy to use and reminds me via notifications and email. Keeps my life on track.,
Very clear interface and a nice priority system to section off the most important things.,
Starting to organize my work time better thanks to this app. Reminders are great!,
So useful! I love it! It's a load off my mind to have a recurring checklist!,
Why has the daily notification stopped outlining the tasks due for today and now instead is giving a useless supposedly motivational message?,
"The best to-do app, love it. Easily synchronizes across all my devices.",
puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly.,
"Best productivity app, clean interface. No paywall for removing ads.",
Amazing app that has helped me accomplish a ton of task and keep track of my life.,
"Some basic features that other app provide are paid features in this app. For example, reminder and labels",
Helpful for everyday to do lists. Easy to create different catagories.,
great time saving and organizing software. i use it every day.,
This app is too complicated for me. After 3 days I canceled it and could not get a refund. Cost me $36.,
"Very capable app, definitely worth the setup if you have a complex to-do list",
Love how it keeps my life organized! The Google calendar integration is awesome.,
"Easy To Use, Aesthetic & Simple. Everything I'd want in a to do list app.",
Literally what is the point if you have to pay to be reminded in notifications?? Didn't give me any alerts at all,
"It's absolutely amazing, helps a lot to note everything down and then be on it.",
really enjoying being organised and I can see what needs doing daily... Great for lockdown projects,
"Last update.is bad, its hard to put time for the task i dont why you have updated that.... i paid for something easy to do why you are making it hard to put a time for the task",
"There is no option to add details for the tasks. Other than that, it is top notch in every aspect.",
"I need a choice of several notifications about the onset of a task. Now I can only choose one, it's not convenient.",
It have reminders in premium version. How it can organize when we can't set reminders,
It is really good and organises your work flow and do not have to worry about incomplete work :),
"As a student, not having at least 10 projects and one time reminders, forced me to switch to any.do...",
Unable to add a label to a task. The app keeps force closing. Using OnePlus 6T,
Mad thanks to Tom Frankly's recommendation. The one and only app i needed all this time. Will upgrade to premium soon,
Pretty helpful to increase your productivity once you get into the habit of using it on a daily basis. Great stuff,
"Useless, reminders are premium. Not going to pay for it before I can try it.",
does what it's supposed to and for free. only thing I don't like is having to make an account instead of keeping everything offline,
"Essential app, that deserves subscription. My life would be much harder without this app.",

Everything has a price.. All interesting parts of thus app are in the premium version...,

"Its a very nice organizational tool and thus, it's a mainstay on my phone for whenever i need to kivk myself to do something.",
"would give five as everything is perfect except that it lacks widgets, it only have 1 widget...",
Simple and I can have it as a widget on my homescreen so I can check without even opening up the app,
very good for a week. saving time and stress. sleeping well..üòçüëç,
Excellent program and several YouTube videos to better understand the use of the software.,
"Basically every feature other than adding a simple task is a ""premium feature"".",
Widget doesn't auto update. I need to open the app every time to do so.,
Moved to Todoist from wunderlist. Didn't want to change but it's great.,
"Great app, widget has a small issue where it keeps auto scrolling to the top of the list",
"Best I've used, and I've used several. Love the easy nesting and UI.",
Best to-do list app ever! minimalistic design and very intuitive,
Solid. Got the paid service and it's great for keeping me organized.,
a little shy on functionality but for the price it can't be beat. I use it daily.,
One ofe the few apps that works woth you and adapta to your style rather than forces you to fight with it.,
I'll switch from ticktick when subtasks get better. Otherwise it's a good app,
It's pretty good so far. I'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps.,
Really easy to use and great for setting future dates and tasks well worth a download,
Best app to use. 3 star only because it is not available in hindi language whenever it will be in hindi language i will add my 2 star. Thanks team Todoist. :),

"Outstanding, much better than Toodledo for Android. Several useful free features!",
happy to use so far. pretty smart one. need to use more to understand full potential though,

Good app to keep track of your to-dos. Has a nice karma thing to keep youself motivated.,

Great layout (good colours and spacing) and easy to use.,
I am getting what I need out of the non-premium option. And it has helped me a lot to prioritise my weeks so far.,
Only wish missed dailys wouldn't count for the current day too. Otherwise brilliant!,
Simple but flexible app for managing todo lists and notifications.,

helps organize my thoughts and schedules really well. easy to reschedule.,
I need an app with free reminders. I forget a lot of things so this is not fair...I'm uninstalling.,

"Being able to set a task's date, time, or project name by just typing is game-changing.",
"Simple, elegant and gets the job done. Really helps to keep track of a busy day.",
"Very good application, but its widget lags sometimes ... Overall it deserves 5 stars !",

Please don‚Äôt do that its not nice to delete apps because you say lies. Lies are not good and if you play with my trust and the world trust you are not helping the world to be a better place you are helping to continue destroy I don't want to open no more apps I don‚Äôt trust what they say,

I'd be lost without it,
It has everything,
keep it up,
"had this app for about a year. it was perfect for what i needed it for at first, but now it's practically unuseable. sections and tasks randomly duplicate and can't be deleted without also deleting unrelated items. i tried updating my app, which didn't help at all. sad to see it go, but i use my calendar every day, and the frustration of dealing with these glitches is simply not worth it!",
"It's been three months and the app still stops syncing periodically. It just hangs, as does the widget. The only way to recover is to delete the app's local data. And their support email address listed in the Play Store is still the same one that they don't actually support. I think it's time to finally give up :(",
The app is not intuitive. Subtask feature is great. Very hard to edit a task once entered. It is easier to just delete the task and re-enter it than waste the time searching for the place to edit the task. It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to move a task from the inbox to the project it needed to be in.,
"Great app. I pay for the subscription because I find the app invaluable for creating structure in my life. However, there was a recent update that changed how reminders are set, and while I do like the new feature, I wish they didn't remove the old one that allowed you to type a specific reminder with your keyboard. For example, I used to be able to type in something like, ""every other Sunday at 8am"", but now I can only select a specific date and time unless I use Todoist on my PC.",
"This app is the best todo list app. I have used this for almost 5 years I think, and it's been great for me and my husband. A todo list cannot get better than this one. However, my life circumstances have changed. This only works when I can do things, not when I want to give jobs to others. I have a kid now, and there are the family schedule, individual member's schedules, plus important things to always have in hand (notes), etc. Thank you todoist and good bye. [Edit below] We've moved to Twist",
"Really helps me keep track of things, love the integration of ""natural language"" for scheduling dates and times. If I had one complaint/suggestions it would be to make reminder notifications more noticeable. I feel I miss my reminders a lot. However, it's a small issue. Todoist has every feature I wanted from a To Do app, and more than a few I didn't know I needed.",
"I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there. There has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months, especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks, and it's been a bit frustrating there. But overall, it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions. Give it a shot!",
"So far, it's great. Just a small suggestion though: In ""comments section"" of tasks, if there are multiple images posted, and I click one to view, I should then be able to view the next one by swiping left/right. Instead I have to click off the image I'm currently on and scroll down the list of comments to find the next one. This was not intuitive to me, because in most SMS apps, whenever you view an image someone has sent you, if you swipe to the left/right, it will scroll through all images.",
"Very clean, well organized to-do list app. It makes completing tasks feel rewarding with the 'karma' feature. The 'projects' feature really helps to organize large projects into more manageable, easy to schedule tasks, which helps you to complete the larger project easily. The only thing I dislike is the fact that the free version does not come with all of the features unlocked, but this app is still my favorite to use even without the extra features.",
"I rely on this app daily for all my personal to do lists. But recent changes to functionality have made it less friendly to use than when I first got it.  For example it's much harder to add a time. Whenever I add a time to a task, it assumes I want to do it today, and I have to go back in and change it back to the original day.   Another annoyance is I can never use the word ""march"" in a task (like the March for Science) because the app thinks I mean the month. There are other words that happens with too, I can't recall them all right now.  Also like another use I don't like the circles on the left to check off the tasks, I keep deleting them accidentally.",
"Awesome but not perfect. Best I've found so far, and I've tried a ton. With a lot of my workflow being email/outlook based, the plug-in is incredibly helpful. It's a little complex, but with great power comes a bit of learning curve. I have an Android phone, an iPad, and work in Windows so the cross platform nature is key for me. Missing a couple things I think are key like being able to enter a completed date in the past (yesterday at least). I'm getting far more done using the app.",
I love this app and I count on it to keep me organized but am not crazy about the latest update. I love that my list appears larger and easier to read but I don't like how it automatically deletes it when an item is hit. I've accidently lost items on my grocery list several times. It has left me feeling less secure that I've crossed everything off my list.,
"Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either. So, no backward search for the events, calendar sharing and other integrations. Well, task and project-wise, this is a powerhouse! Much more simple and well designed than Google Keep I've been using for years.",
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first.",
"It's a great app, but just like any organization app, you have to meet it halfway with actual effort. If you don't actually intend to complete the work, don't kid yourself by getting the app. I only wish it included a calendar that displayed events in chronological order along with the list of events in bullet point format and that it sent reminders of events. I'm very picky about apps, but this one is actually nice.",
"Best to do list I've found. I used to use Trello but it didn't work for me. This does everything Trello didn't. Love the Inbox and how i can access it from a widget on my phone with one press. Also i have the other widget that shows my list of choice. I love how you can schedule items just by typing when you want them, even if it repeats. It's a very smooth interface. A few of the premium features would be really nice to have. It's tempting but i don't like recurring fees. I'd rather pay once.",
"Very good to do list app! Looks nice, easy to create new tasks with the automatic detection of dates, times, priorities, and topic. Does not show ads and is pretty generous with the free version. My only issue so far has been occasional desync between devices (can be solved by logging out and logging back in). Also, note that the free version doesn't allow you to set reminders.",
"Seems like a pretty cool app, I like how quick it is to set up tasks. Would be great for some people's situations, but since I'm looking for something for personal use and have no need for additional projects, larger files (or files in general), or filters it is a waste of money to pay a monthly subscription just to be able to set up any reminders at all. Guess I'm back to my search for a good todo list app...",
"Mostly pros but one big con.. Absolutely love this app. It is really is user friendly and has helped me so much with organizing my life. One big con though is I had a big issue with the Google calendar integration. I had to disconnect it as it messed up my calendar and I lost a bunch of data that I needed to reenter. Luckily, it was uploaded to todoist so I didn't have to hunt for it. I really hope they fix that issue.",
"I've been using todoist for years now and it's nice being able to access my list from my phone or computer. Bad news is that with the latest update, the ""add task"" widget won't work. It said the app doesn't exist, so I tried to remove the widget and place it again, but it makes the Home UI crash every time. It did the same thing on my husband's phone.",
"Updated review to 4 stars from 1. The usability was very poor, but I looked online, and on youtube and eventually solved main problem. It was that when I made subtasks in Today view, they remained as original, but also in the new list as well (subtasked only there)! So I had a lot of duplicates. I stand by my earlier assertion that this is very poor usability from a new user's point of view. Also, I upgraded to premium and it is annoying that they charge 30 dollars up front (annual), instead of a reasonable monthly charge. However it is proving helpful and I look forward to future changes as well. Original review: Poorly designed, subtasks listed in a nonsensical manner. Doing basic things such as un-checking items a hassle.",
"I love this app! I've tried a few other task list type applications, but this one really takes the cake! Their format is very flexible and has all the basics offered for free...except reminders. Data syncs well across devices, you can create subprojects, stacked task lists, and many other useful features! I check Todoist throughout my day and it's working well for me so far. If you need reminders, check out their premium version! It has plenty of features that are actually worth paying for. ;)",
"Reliable, flexible, easy to use. I have more flexibility in organizing my to-do list the way I want to see it, and still use GTD. Only minor drawback: wish there was another way to set repeating tasks other than putting it into words. Putting it into words might seem easier than the menus seen om most other To Do apps, but you have to put the words in a precise way and even then it might still take a few tries before Todoist picks up the repeat request.",
"Simply brilliant. Everything you could want. Thoughtfulness is the word that comes to mind whenever I discover a new feature. Some awesome big features like location reminders and integrations, and tons of clever little features too. free version has a respectable collection of features that don't let you down, but I'm seriously considering getting the premium version.",
"this app has been great for keeping track of what I have to do each day. it conveniently syncs on all of my devices so it's always up to date no matter where I am and what device I'm using. it's easy and satisfying to mark something as ""complete"". it reminds you when you have overdue tasks, but gives you the option to quickly reschedule them to another time so you dont feel guilty. all in all, it's a great app that does exactly what it needs to do! highly recommended!",
"So I'm moving over to this app from TickTick because I like how it looks. I believe ticktick is more condusive to time management, but Todoist seems like the better overall to-do list app. The big problem I am having is stability. When trying to create a label within a to-do, it crashes. I've also experienced crashes when switching projects. I subscribed thinking the $8 extra would be a better experience, but so far I'm a bit concerned. I'll give the app a few weeks before giving up.",
"I recently moved from a job where I utilized Microsoft Outlook's tasks. I struggled to find an app that could perform as well as Outlook. This app does everything and more! On PC...I love the predictive typing, Google Chrome attachment, flagging emails, typing notes, attaching files, reminders, and more. And it syncs across all my devices. On the app I love how fluid it is. It is so easy to use! After trying literally almost every to do app out there, this one gets my five stars! I have tried Google Tasks, Microsoft tasks, Wunderlist, Any.do, and many more. I've even paid for a majority of them. This one is well worth the money!",
"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.",
"Love the minimalist nature of Todoist. It's exactly the right number of features. Inbox, projects, quick add tasks with keyword support - all great features that make the app quick and easy to use. Too many other to-do apps are overly complicated. This is by far the best one I've come across. (Free version, single user.)",
"It is a great to do app that takes a little while to find all the customization possibilities for, but when you do it works wonderfully, and even the free version is clean with no ads as I'm writing this. The biggest change I'd like to see is the ability to visualize progress through goals, daily tasks and overall projects in a more helpful way that shows the percent progress made in each priority level.",
"I had been looking for a to do list app with projects and connection to my calendar. There's a lot of stuff out there, but for some reason I fell in love with todoist. I saw it in a few YouTube videos and tried it out for myself and it has worked flawlessly. Two of my favorite features are projects and synchronization of my calendar and todoist on both sides. So if I add something to todoist, it gets added to my calendar and vice versa. Awesome, awesome utility!",
"Best GTD app. If you are building a list system based on David Allen's book getting things done, I think this is absolutely the best app to use for that. I have had GTD systems on Evernote, Onenote, Microsoft to do, and a paper notebook, and this is by far the best in almost every way. It's easy to use, has no bugs, has a bunch of great bells and whistles, and it syncs seamlessly across all platforms. The user experience is great too. It draws me in to my lists, rather than repelling me.",
"Taking off a star because I'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update. I'm not a fan of having to click the drop-down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once. Especially because the task selection mode expires each time I make a single change to the selected tasks, requiring me to then go into the drop-down menu again to and then re-select all of the tasks I just selected. I really liked before how I could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks. I know this change was made to allow easy re-ordering of tasks, although I don't find this particularly helpful because I don't typically re-order my tasks. I would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once.",
"Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.",
"After trying *so* many different time management apps (even the $200/yr ones), this one the best. I love that the date you type in the add task bar automatically assigns it to the date. You can set events, tasks, and reminders all with voice to text while driving! The only thing I'd *love* is a more conventional ""calendar"" view where I can easily see what's in store for the month with one glance. Keep up the good work!",
"The app looked very promising, but there were too many ""Upgrade to premium"" notifications when initially clicking through the app. From what I saw, I probably would have paid for a year if I was able to try out the fill app first. Instead, I got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications. For these reasons, 3 stars and lost buisness.",
"This app has improved my life so much. It's true that once I get the tasks written down, it clears my head for better management of the rest of my day/responsibilities. I can either make a list of things to do in general or assign tasks to certain days/times. I can make different lists for different projects. I REALLY ‚ù§Ô∏è the homescreen widget that I see whenever I check my phone. Some features you can choose to pay for, but the free version has enough features to do what I need. Never deleting!",
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!",
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.",
Perfect for organizing big life goals and daily tasks all in one. I've been using the pro version for 5 years now. I love how easy it is to organize tasks within one another and i use the scheduling features to their fullest extent. I use it on all my devices. Works well with small teams too. Now i never worry about losing an idea or missing a task. It's all written down forever and I never have to worry about what I forgot.,
"Love this app! It's easy to use, and once you get used to it, it gets even easier. It's the first app I've ever actually stuck to, because of its goal setting. It gives ""Karma"" points for successfully marking things off, and makes me want to stick with it. I emailed the developers with a question just one time, and they were quick and helpful with their response. The Premium version is worth every penny!",
"Incredibly convenient and simple, but I hope that the feature to attach photos (from your gallery or straight from your camera), links, and documents can be without the premium. Just a really naive wish, coming from a student. Other than that,  this app is really good, and its customer service is as admirable. Good job!",
"This is a great to-do app. The interface is easy to use and looks great. Natural language scheduling works really well. ToDoist is supported on a wide variety of platforms. This includes Android and IOS. I really like that there is a phone app and web browser access. You can share projects with other users. Things to note: if you want to schedule your day, you can set due dates and time but you are better served using a calendar app. ToDoist isn't well suited for recurring checklists.",
"This is by far the best tasking app out there. As someone who struggles with ADHD, this has been a lifesaver. It can sync with calendars, remind you of things based on location or time, and lots of other cool things. The interface is intuitive and tasks can be as simple or as detailed as needed. Additionally, it can work as a kanban board and be used among teams if needed. It works on and syncs across web, mobile, even my smart watch. Could not recommend more.",
This is a great system! I'm pretty disorganized so I'm of the opinion that if it works for me and the mess of my life that exists it must work for everybody. The only thing it needs is an inbuilt monthly calendar. PARTICULARLY for events/appointments. Also while I am aware that reminders are for premium only (and as such are not a factor for losing a star) i am slightly unsure whether or not the reminder works like an alarm system where it will buzz at the time that you have set for the event.,
"One of the most useful apps I've ever used. It has a charming, professional interface that takes to-do lists to another level. For someone whose life runs on systems, this is imperative to making sure my day gets done. It has saved me many times and offers some nice extra features with a premium subscription that is very helpful but possibly not necessary for everyone. I could go on but I'll just say try it and make your own conclusions.",
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? The old widget could do things the app couldn't, and can't. Give it back! Matters have improved, though - it's now easy to open the app from the new widget.",
"It's a fine task manager app, a little bit hard to get at first with the weird natural language based task creation, but if you're willing to put in the effort it's pretty intuitive. The one big deal breaker for me is that if you have a daily recurring task it becomes overdue at midnight. If you tap it complete after midnight, it completes it for the next day which ends up with you missing a day unless you remember to do it on your own or manually set the next recurrence to today.",
"I use this app everyday at work--it's a great app with lots of options for keeping tasks organized. However, the latest update seems to have introduced a bug. Sometimes, while adding sub-tasks to a task, the app will auto-complete everything. All sub-tasks will simultaneously mark themselves as completed, and the only way to undo it is to go back and uncheck them one by one. Sometimes the cursor will also skip to the ""Comments"" box while in the middle of writing a sub-task.",
"This app has helped me re-establish good habits, remember things when I couldn't afford to forget (very forgetful person) and conquer my procrastination bit by bit. The slightly gamified interface helps to make the app fun, and more personalized for me. I do wish it were a little more like a game, some level-ups and rewards wouldn't hurt. Overall, very useful and encouraging. Doesn't feel clingy or noisy.",
"This is my dream personal planning app. I love the design, it looks and feels great to use. It's simple and intuitive but also very powerful. There any plenty of ways to group tasks, and the filters are very powerful for viewing them however you want. And it's fully featured. It has collaboration, a great widget, and integrations with a lot of other apps, including Google Assistant.",
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.",
"A few days in and so far so good. Definitely has a few non-intuitive functions. Setting custom reminders is weird...a pop-up should just appear to select a date and time, but instead you type it in then it tries to interpret what you type, then you select it if it is right. Very convoluted. Finally found the task completion statistics. Its next to your profile icon/picture when clicking on the three horizontal lines top left. Small circle with squiggly arrow with some numbers next to it.",
"What is the point of a ""To Do"" list without reminders? Nope, you don't get a notification reminder unless you pay for premium, you can't even try it to see if it will work better than Microsoft To-Do (which can't stay running for anything). Without notifications/alarms I can make a ""To Do"" list using a notebook & pen or the paper calendar I have on my fridge! The whole point of searching for a useful app is to use modern features, like reminders/alarms & custom days, dates, & times.",
"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works.",
"To start, notifications shouldn't be a premium feature. The main reason I want a to-do list on my phone is so I can get more from it, including reminders. Second, even the free features didn't function as the guide said they would. I tried to add a recurring task for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as per the instructions, but it wouldn't even do that. Edit2: sent image confirming smart recog is on, but you can't screenshot with the keyboard on and cannot turn keyboard off while setting time.",
"Great to-do list app, I just wish the task widget was more responsive. It's a bit annoying to tap a task to check it off, it takes a second to actually check off, and then wait several more seconds for the list to refresh before you can interact with anything else. I primarily use the widget to interact with the app, so the way that functions is very important to me.",
"No easy way to view your completed tasks. Everything else about this app is great, but this one missing feature is a HUGE dealbreaker. For 90% of people, the benefit of a todo list is to see what you have done easily, and get a sense of achievement from it. If they added that feature I'd give it 5 stars, but I find this app unusable without this feature.",
The app itself is good but the voice integration on Android is not intuitive nor powerful. I have to jump through several hoops to get my task logged and it often ends up wrong. This might be an issue with Google as well. But I am looking for a quick way to get tasks logged when I can't type. Instead I find my self fumbling to press buttons again...,
"Hi, The app's interface and usability is pretty good. But the time zone feature has some bugs. If I set a different time zone on my device and a different one within the app, it causes problems. I was hoping that you guys could overcome those. It would help a lot of students stuck with asynchronous learning and online classes ü§íü•≤.",
"Great todo app with minimalistic UI, however there is a bit of missing potential. The app is fairly full of features, however for key things like notifications you aren't given many settings to customize them. Another example is you can't have tasks auto-scheduled based on the project it is in or the labels it has. I paid for a subscription (only $4) to test out labels and everything this app and the desktop version offered and I was a bit underwhelmed by the lack of automation features.",
"Easy to use. It takes a second to get used to controls but then it super easy. I use the widget to add task throughout the day. My list stays condensed in my notifications. Only when I click on it, does it show me everything on my list. I love this app because it helps me remember things, and helps me stay on track when I have a million things going at once (I'm a Mom, Wife and Student).",
"Overall, the interface is just ok. It's difficult to sometimes figure out where to type things to add the event to your list and changing the date on an event can be annoying as well. Then you have to pay to even set a reminder alarm... But it functions well and is a fairly straightforward layout.",
It does what it needs to. I just wish instead of email notifications when things were over due that I would get push notifications instead. I think it is hard to balance having a free tool and a paid version for something like this and the free version gives you the bare minimum. I dont know how the paid version would provide me with any better service as an individual than the free version aside from push notifications.,
Love this app! started with the free version and upgraded right away. It really helped me get my life and schedule under control when I started my business. I am still learning some of the more advanced ways to use it and find it gets more and more helpful with time. I love that i can send emails directly to it and make them into tasks and also i totally get into tracking my progress and getting points! im a geek like that LoL,
"I have been on a mission to find a to-do list that syncs well between my phone, smartwatch, and google calendar. I have tried just about every to-do list out there and in some aspect, every single one of them fell short. I was about to give up hope when I came upon this app! Thanks to this app, I am now the organized and productive person that I always knew I could be but never could find the right tool to make it happen!! Thank you!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
"I love the app. I just wish there was an option for a one time payment for premium. I have too many subscriptions, and I always cancel new subscriptions in a short amount of time because I find that I don't use the app enough to pay monthly or yearly. The apps that I can pay once for premium are the apps I usually stick with. I use this a lot for tracking my spending and budget, so a subscription is kind of counter intuitive.",
"I am a fan of GTD which is really just a system of lists. I have tried all the big name task managers out there. Todoist is by far my favorite. Once you catch on to the natural language processing it is so easy to record everything that comes to mind in the ""In"" box then do a review later to decide what to do. Since I always have my phone I use the notification bar icon to record stuff as I think of it. Nothing ever gets lost or forgotten. It is wondeful to have a septem you can depend on!",
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it.",
"Truly my favorite to-do list app I've ever tried. My one small quibble is that it always has trouble accepting multiple keywords, for example if it's Monday and I need to set up an items that is weekly on Tuesdays, I can't just type ""Tuesday weekly"" but have to go tinker around in the settings. I'd also like more customization over the look, with fonts and colors.",
"I really like this app and use it everyday. However, these new Pop Ups that come out of nowhere congratulating me on checking off tasks are incredibly annoying. I don't need a digital pat on the back. Maybe some people like that and that's great. Personally, I just want to keep checking off tasks or looking at what's next to do and these pop ups just get in the way of that and irritate me. Can you please make it so I can turn them off? I've searched the settings and I can't find it anywhere.",
"Newest update completely renders filters and upcoming useless. Just a white screen. Testing before launching changes obviously didn't happen. Edit: the newest update renders the app functional. However, it is still very glitchy. Upon selecting filters, the view is not updated until you scroll the screen. And filter names are truncated to 2 or 3 letters.",
"The perfect todo app. It's so easy and quick to set up really powerful filters and workflows to make sure you're focusing on the tasks that matter most. Not to mention the performance and UX is super snappy, so you can note, organize, and check off tasks without wasting time you could spend getting things done fumbling with the app.",
"This little app got me through my finals this quarter. The simplicity and variety of scheduling options makes it very useful. At first I thought premium was dumb and I wouldn't need it, but they offered a free 30 day trial without having to add my credit card and I quickly got addicted. Once the 30 day trial was over I couldn't go back so I paid the 36$ year which I would say is extremely reasonably priced. Very recommended, especially for school. Helped me stay on track and never miss any hmwk",
"It's good, but the layout requires an extra click to get to the calendar week view, and that's my favorite view because I want todoist to be my weekly planner. If I have to click into the app, click the side bar, and then click into the calendar view, it's too much work. Those three views (today, calendar view, etc) I would like clickable like at the bottom always, or the ability to swipe between the views.",
"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget. These are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule. The widget could be improved, otherwise the app is great.",
"Fantastic app. I needed something like this to improve my productivity with reminders for work, and this app delivers more with cool features like projects, tags, priorities, comments, and so much more. The smart-typing and interpretation of text is amazing to set specific dates and tags just by typing, it really speeds up the process of creating tasks, which makes it easier to use and way more functional. I highly recommend the app, and the unlocked subscription fee is incredibly reasonable!",
"This app is easy to learn and use, and yet so powerful. It has been extremely robust and supports every common desktop and mobile platform. Adding a task with natural language scheduling is such a breeze! It also supports queries to view your tasks in many different ways. The free version is complete and usable, with no ads! But I'm seriously considering upgrading to pro just to support these developers. It takes a lot of skill and dedication to make an app this robust and well designed.",
"I used Apple Reminders for a while until I switched ecosystems. You have to pay to get the most out of it, but it's worth it to me. Excellent integration with Google Calendar and it works on all my platforms (Windows, Android, and Chromebook). Helps out a lot. Not the best voice assistant integration, but still great!",
"So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.",
"Over time I've tried a lot of to-do list apps. Todoist has long been one I've come back to over and over and finally, I've settled on it as my favorite. During the past few years Todoist has helped me stay focused to grow my freelance business. It's also helped me when I get anxious and overwhelmed. I can easily set my daily list to just a few manageable tasks and move things to the back burner or ""inbox"". I love Todoist and its Getting Things Done methodology.",
"Very positive so far. Installed the app about a week ago and it took a couple of days before I felt entirely comfortable with it. The learning curve is very modest overall, it's one the few to-do list applications that's truly multiplatform. It have it installed on my iPad, Windows PC and Android phone (OK already! I kno6, and so far it has performed brilliantly. I'll update this eval if I run into any issues. but so far so good. Highly recommended...",
A little difficult to get the hang of. But all in all a great app. Only issue I'm having is that my recurring subtasks show up twice on my daily checklist which clutters up the list. The duplicates also appear outside the main task so I can't unexpand them to clear up the clutter. Other than that everything works well so far.,
There are so many to do apps out there and so many comparison articles it was difficult to even choose one. I tried several and this one definitely seemed like the best so I purchased the premium version and it is great. Save yourself some time and aggravation just get this one. Try the free version first. The premium cost is $3 per month subscription bille yearly for $36 and although there is no free trial of the premium version you do have 30 days for a refund if you don't like it but you will.,
"Awesome App overall. I like how you can create separate lists for different categories. However I'd appreciate if the subtasks could be reworked to allow for the main tasks and the subtasks to be marked as completed separately. The reason I use subtasks in the first place is because they're related to my main task, yet I need to complete them at different times than the main task. Right now if I mark one as complete, the whole thing is marked as complete, which defeats the purpose.",
"Very fun and intuitive app! Completing a task is rewarding, and the app is very good at notifying me of my tasks for the day. It is also great at organizing my tasks, and I love the option of adding a task to the Inbox - a great way to still add something without the immediate need to file it under a category. One issue I have is on Wear OS: on my Fossil Gen 6 (Wear OS 2), scrolling with the rotating crown causes a frenzy of vibration and the app to freeze. Please fix this!",
"I got lucky that this is the first to-do list app I have ever used. It is excellent in every way! It allows you to add items, prioritize items, move items around on your list, categorize items, and has multiple inboxes all with the free version. More options are available for the premium version if you need them.",
"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that.",
"I adore this app. I type in everything I need to get done, then sort it all by date and priority. At the beginning of the day, I pick three tasks to rate as priority one. At the end of the day, I can easily postpone tasks I didn't accomplish without feeling bad. I feel organized, and like I can finally tackle my seemingly endless to-do list in a logical manner.",
Its good. WAY better than when I first tried it. The features are excellent. Esp because I use it mainlie for life stuff and to get the functionality it offers most productivity apps make you pay a per user fee. I've tried about 9 in the past year and a half so im prettie confident in the quality of Todoist. Runner up Asana as a for instance doesn't automatically remove completed tasks on their free version... bananas.,
"So-so app. The way to move a task to a different Project from the search results is obscure ‚Äî as described in the developer's response here, it requires scrolling a list that shows no visible indication it can be scrolled. In other contexts, swiping the task right provides a Move option; but, as is common with Microsoft, the way to move a task in the search results doesn't match how it works in other contexts, and isn't obvious at all.",
"I recently completed the forced upgrade for the app, and now it doesn't work consistently.....repeatedly, the app has frozen up completely and none of my tasks appear. If I'm able to get it working again (aftet multiple restarts), all the changes i made in recent sessions are gone. It worked perfectly before. I'm SO annoyed! I've been a todoist user for years, but if this isn't fixed, I'll switch to something that works consistently (already made that switch, for work projects).",
"Absolutely love this app because this is a digital version of how I've always organically done it. Can assign things to projects or labels. Have due dates and repeating events but also no dates if you want! Love how the website/desktop version is so similar to the app that navigating between the two is a breeze In terms of minor changes I'd like to be able to repeat but ""every other day"" or ""every monday, Tuesday, and Thursday"" for semi regular events/chores/tasks. Overall 10/10",
"I'm an OCD business owner and this app is perfect for me. If you want clean widgets on your home screen for quick and easy tasks and goal setting this app beats all the others. I personally wasted 12 hours researching and playing around with the task and to do apps and these guys take the cake. Great UI, great customizability, not too try hard. I love how you can create lists for different things and set different categories on the same list so you don't have to hit back when swapping lists.",
"You don't have to pay for Todoist for it to be useful. At its core it is a digital to do list with flexibility for whatever you want to throw at it. You can schedule recurring routines easily, break down large projects into smaller subtasks and organize it all to your liking. I use Todoist as a big picture planner. The desktop program is what I use for weekly planning and task input. But when I'm out in the world making it happen the phone app is just as valuable. I say give it a try!",
Prepare to pay. It looks like a very useful app if you pay for it. The basic features I have access to for free are good; easy to use & had a nice front end user experience. I can't give 5 stars because I'm not going to pay to access the extra features when I can use Samsung Notes for free for the same basic abilities. I don't need it bad enough to pay.,
"The repeat option is nonexist. The only time its allowed me to repeat a task is ""every month"". At first I thought ""every two weeks"" might be too confusing for it but I tried ""every week"" and ""every day"" and it doesn't pop up except for that first day. Also the fact that it often lists the scheduled date as ""today"" despite me not yet picking a date is stupid, and it resets to ""today"" automatically when I try to edit the task in any way (like change the name). It doesn't make any sense!",
"Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.",
"I really like this app and the smart tags feature of being able to tag it on a project which is super quick. You can also use boards like in Trello. A lot of really great functionality in this app. The only issues I've had is syncing between desktop app and phone a few times, but once I logged out and back in on app it synced my tasks so hopefully that will get fixed soon. I haven't tried doing that again, but I will soon.",
"Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!",
This thing just keeps getting better and better. These guys are doing great. I loved the google calendar integration and discovered to my delight today that since its inception it has been improved on and I can now add a separate calendar integration per list for those few lists that need it. Sync is instant and oh so helpful. Thanks a lot guys!,
"My experience has been hit or miss. After listening to the developer on the YNAB podcast recently, with my new role in IT as a Solutions Architect, there is immense value in a proper organization and to do list application, especially task boards. Paid for premium. Unfortunately, when clicking a label in the left nav in favorites, it does nothing and you're still left viewing the Inbox, Today or Upcoming pane you were in. It doesn't filter or behave as it should. Edit: I was doing it wrong!",
Pros: Can add two levels of subtasks to tasks. Four priority levels. Can drag tasks up and down to prioritize them further. Any number of color coded custom labels can be added to each task. Dark theme available. Cons: NO reminders without paying every month which is pretty bad. I understand charging for premium features but reminders on a task manager is one of the most basic features possible. Can't find a way to backup. *Also: stop deleting my reviews...,
Genuinely out of this world. This app goes above and beyond in creating a seamless organising system that really allows you to get your mind off and scribble as many thoughts as possible and then organise them. And it tracks it perfectly. It syncs with the PC version excellently and rewards you for every task done making you feel the progress and it gives you many metrics to further illustrate how much you've done in a short period of time. One of the best out there üëç,
I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.,
"It's okay. I thought it would be much better for tracking recurring tasks. Once you miss a task, it just says overdue. Even if it happens multiple times a day, you won't be getting reminded again. Not worth paying for pro with notifications if this is how it works. I paid for a year but I won't be renewing if this doesn't change.",
"Awesome! Best of all worlds. Inbox for ideas that doesn't clutter priority items to get done. Easy scheduling and projects with multiple layers of sub projects. Easy to hide sub projects and assign to different days. Easy to tag, prioritize, sort, etc. In the past, I would use a list, it would get cluttered and overwhelming, then I would start a whole new list in defeat. With Todoist, I actually get to the end of my list, before the end of the day.",
I almost went with TickTick because of the calendar within the app and the habits feature. But in the end I just couldn't pass up the level of organization that Todoist offers. I have ADHD and I really need visuals to get through my days. This app seems to work well with how I think. I feel good at the end of the day when I can clear out my tasks. The integration with Google calendar is useful for planning my days. I will most likely pay for premium.,
"I'm not 100% happy with how it's set up, but it's working well enough to help keep me organized. Since it's a web based app, I can still access my info when my phone acts up, and I won't lose all my data again the next time my phone craps out and I have to do a factory reset. My main complaint is that it doesn't work exactly the same as the other app that I'm already used to, but that one didn't reliably back up and I lost my data one too many times. I'll get used to this one.",
"Todoist is an excellent app with excellent support. I use Todoist to help stay on top of the flow of information coming at me, have and also utilized the repeating task function for regular checklist items. I also love using the labels for contextual tasks, like emails, calls, errands, at home, at computer, etc. It's been a game changer in my ability to be productive and efficient. Todoist support is awesome, too. If you're looking to become more productive and retain a sense of control over the things you are (and are not) doing, HIGHLY recommend this app! I also recommend reading GTD.",
"Worthless app. Have been using the premium version for 6 months now, and much preferred the previous free version from over a year ago that had the auto reschedule function in case you actually try to intentionally write down more than you can accomplish in a day to make sure things don't fall through the crack. Wish I had known thay feature was removed before purchasing, but without it, it's actually more work than just writing it as a simple checklist.",
"Very handy app. They are tons of tips and tutorials about how to get it to practically sit up and roll over. Really does help with productivity. Works with Alexa for the most part too. Updated now that I've used it for a while. I have the Pro version now, and it's very handy, especially for looking back at completed tasks. I know there are lots of tricks I don't know yet, but I do recommend this product.",
"It is an effective todo app with some unique and useful features. Paying $3/month for the premium subscription might be worth it...I'm still deciding on this app vs Wunderlist, the one I've used previously. Predictive typing for things like ""by today at 5pm"" is great but the free version has limited capabilities with reminders. Happily, no ads. It works nice between multiple platforms which is essential, especially since you can key things in on the PC VERY quickly. Karma points help motivate.",
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",
I appreciate how easy it is to create and modify a To-Do List. The ability to group multiple Lists under a Project Title is very useful. I also like the Sub-Task feature which allows me to add details to a specific Task. Another feature that I found to be helpful is the email notifications that monitor my scheduled Tasks. The Application feature set is well thought out. I would recommend this application to anyone who needs an organizational tool to help them be more productive.,
I set multiple test reminders to see what kind of notification I'd receive and I haven't gotten a single one. I checked permissions and settings to make sure nothing turned off by default. I set a few at different times for reminders and they all passed by with nothing. No push or emails or anything. I can't exactly recommend using a reminder app that doesn't actually give you reminders.,
"Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.",
"I really like this app... It's unique in that the commands are very simple and it can recognize plain-text times and dates, and organizing each entry into sections, or ""projects"" is easy. I would recommend setting up the app online or on a computer because managing projects and sub-projects is difficult within the app. My one regret is that the app is broken up into calendar days. I, and a few others don't necessarily consider it ""tomorrow"" until I've gone to sleep and woken up the next day. I'll have a daily task, like reading, that can float through my day... often times I'll get it done in the might before I go to bed, other times it'll happen in the afternoon when I have free time. I can schedule my reading task daily, but if I complete the task at 12 AM on the night of November 1st, it counts as ""tomorrow"" and won't automatically reappear until November 3rd. I propose that Todoist have a night-owl setting, in which we late-nighters can define when our days end. I don't want my reading to count for November 2 if I'm completing the task for November 1 before I've gone to sleep. I don't want Todoist to skip that task to November 3 even if it is the next calendar day because I won't have done my reading for November 2. I wish that we would be able to define our 24 hour period as one day instead of solely relying on Calendar dates.",
"I occasionally check out other list tools, buy come back to this one. The full UI works great, but the widget doesn't work that well on Android 12 - it behaves far better on my tablet stuck on Android 10. On my phone it often double/triple reloads, and some reloads just spin until opening the app. Plus, either due to that or having a smaller phone, I mostly fail trying to mark the completion bubble. bubble.",
"My experience with Todoist has been great. It has helped me keep track of all my college assignments that I must complete. It's also helpful that it reminds you when things are overdue. Making the list is very simple as well. All you do is press the + button, type the thing you need to do, press the > button, and BAM! you're all set.",
"This app is my lifeline but it's insanely buggy the past couple weeks, and keeps crashing. Always has had a problem syncing with browser extensions as well. Either browser or the app won't update globally. Usually it's the browser that won't but lately the app won't update and the browser extensions are the only ones working properly. Please help fix this todoist! All the typical troubleshooting is not helping. 2.14 edit back up to 5 stars - update fixed! Woohoo üôåüéâ",
"I've tried multiple to-do list organizer applications and have found Todoist to be the best for me. Sync was a big problem cross platform for me even using Microsoft's To-Do. I'd create my lists ans tasks on my PC and then go to pull them up on my phone when on the job site onky to find nothing I had entered was there. This happened time and time again. so began my search and I found Todoist. It is fast, easy to organize. You can tag, prioritize, add photos. I really like the karma too!",
"Best task manager I have EVER used. Much more usable than most gamified task managers, but still has a nice experiemce point and goal mechanic. Completely intuitive. Hotkeys make it fast and easy to input tasks, and having multiple project lists . My favorite feature is how I can dump an entire semester's worth of homework in my todo list at once, not get overwhelmed, and know that it will show up in my daily task list right on time. I recommend this so often.",
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.,
decent app for phone use although there are better options that offer more features for free if you strictly want to use only one phone. what makes this stand out is the integration with other devices such as android wear which allows you to add and complete tasks from your watch and easily see the next task you need to complete.,
"i love this app very much! its organization is so efficient and i love how you can automate recurring tasks and the projects are so amazing! will be looking into possibly getting premium. my only thing is i wish there was more graphics/fonts/theme options. I understand simplicity is the premise, but I like having a pretty schedule or at least a personal looking one. even if not, a pink theme for premium please üò≠ but other than that it is a fantastic app!!",
"After turning off *all* of the notifications, it's exactly the To Do app *I* need. Instead of sixty sheets of paper with projects I'm working on or was working on or ideas for art or groceries or whatever! I have this. I've been using it about a week, and so far, I think it's working out rather well.",
"The best feature is detecting date and time while typing. Free version is very good and doesn't annoyingly pester you with popup ads. I wish I could individually buy features like themes, but it is a subscription... If you're not too crazy about tagging and mostly about speed and efficiency, this free app is for you.",
"Downloaded the app so I could have a widget with my list on my home screen. shortly thereafter, tney added checkboxes, which can't be turned off, making it easy to accidentally ""complete"" a task on the widget. And unlike when you have the app open, this can't be undone. It was good when I downloaded it, but is now completely useless.",
"Pretty neat app, very simple. When you input tasks (I do it via voice input), you can simply add little details like ""change tires next Monday"" and it will automatically add it to monday. it parses your details bout very well. you can even add times and I dont even KNOW what else it could do. Great app! Also, i have different projects which have individual tasks, very organized.",
"User friendly but very glitchy. Drag and drop new task feature won't work if too close to bottom of screen. Selecting multiple tasks only highlights the first one. When collapsing groups of tasks, app sometimes freezes. When re-ordering tasks, the app will sometimes (15% of the time) move the task back to where it originally was. ""Reordered"" msg doesn't auto-disappear. I frequently restart the app to get past glitches. Using on Samsung Galaxy S8 Android 9 Pie.",
"Not very impressed with the app. The repeating task function in not intuitive like other scheduling apps which will have a ""repeat every"" field. The Watch part of the app (which I got it for) is wonky. Every time I open the app it spams asking for location permission (which I have no intention of using). It says I have 8 tasks to do today, but there is only 1 when I click on it. Also it adds a bunch of junk tasks when you first start it.",
"Love this app. I have debilitating ADHD (if you know, you know) and this app makes my life manageable. Filters and priority settings keep to do lists from getting scrambled and overwhelming. For example, I use the urgent/important paradigm for priority setting, and the filters are perfect. Integrate with Google calendar. Project management with subtasks. If you have executive dysfunction, even the free version of this is a life saver. Also desktop is Linux compatible so that's a huge plus for me",
"It looks nice, but a couple issues making it not great for repeated tasks. 1. When a task is overdue (either missed or forgot to check off), there's no way to check off that iteration or mark as missed, checking off the overdue one checks off the next iteration. 2. The widget has no way to apply both ""Today"" and a project filter. 3. No way to change what to consider start of day to be. A lot of my tasks personally I do around midnight, so it's impossible to setup for that.",
Used to be simple well organized app. Latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your data.... Most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared. For some reason timed ones seemed to stick around... Completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in. If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks. They claim all your information is backed up securely but when I asked for my completed tasks they were not able to provide my attachments.,
"By far the best task management app I've ever used. Supports labels, projects, due dates, has reliable notifications, a gamification system, a great interface, support for every major OS.. I couldn't be more satisfied. The integration with Google Home is less than ideal, but that is a small complaint.",
I really wanted to like this app but there is no way to order items on todo lists. I have at this point had to reorder all of my items over 10 times for each because when u use the drag and drop menu to change the order it doesn't save it permanently there is also no way to sort your todo lists by date because I figured if I input a deadline for each item it would show me what I had to do with the one due the soonest at the top but no. I wish there were more ways to sort or at least filter date,
Great app and gets more helpful the more you use it to keep.track of your tasks. Works across multiple devices. It offers a good way tp organize your tasks without an cluttered interface. One feature i would like is the ability to.have asporational tasks that do not count for or against your karma score ie things that you can do if you have time but no problem if they dont get done. This app.has definitely changed my life for the better.,
"Great for organizing tasks, assigning to others, creating subtasks and categories. However, my problem keeping me from coming back is my inability to check off a task once it's complete. if I don't check off the subtask, I don't move on to the next subtask, and that task can get forgotten (or worse yet, burdens my mind with the anxiety of all I have yet to accomplish). Home pages don't highlight what I need to do well, reminders pile on, and it get as cluttered as my mind once again.",
"Absolutely love this app. So easy to add and organize to-do items, prioritize tasks, manage projects. Works well everywhere. Technically, it's not supposed to be compatible with my Windows 10 64-bit version, but I use it there anyway, and it works most days. Totally worth the cost for the Pro version. I'd be far less productive without it.",
"It has the ability to add sub-tasks to sub-tasks, making the actual lists I create more helpful, y'all HAD a leg-up on Google, unfortunately there is no option to keep tasks/sub-tasks in a specific order, so the entirety of my list crumples because my list relies on being chronological, and Keep Notes (my phones default) DOES have an option for that, so it's 1-1 now. Hopefully that gets fixed, so I never have to look for a checklist app again. Also cannot see completed tasks AND have sorting on.",
"The task manager to get. I've used it as a professional task manager and light PM tool for work, and my personal to do list for years. Worth the paid license, making it easy to see my tasks on a widget, set up categories, add reminders, enable recurrence, put in notes, and reschedule. Integration across Android and Windows works. The 'karma' system for progress keeps one motivated to be successful",
"excellent interface for setting appts, rescheduling, and editing tasks. It is super easy to use and will help keep you on schedule as you watch your productivity grow. I would recommend it to anybody looking to increase thier production by staying organized and on schedule. I manage properties and so tracking lists and appointments are very essential to my occupational success.",
"Todoist has some useful features, one of the most useful is task reminders (although this is only fully available in ""pro""). However, a simple feature would be to check off tasks completed yesterday, but every day, daily tasks reset at midnight and there is no going back. Simple feature, I know other apps that have it, and I've seen comments online of people begging for this feature for years. So the most useful thing I get out of the app is paid for, and the rest leaves much to be desired. üôÉ",
Ive tried so many similar apps to keep my tasks and thoughts organized. I needed an app that made sense to my way of thinking. This app makes the most sense to me. The ability to have many layers of sub-tasks is a big plus for me. But my favorite feature is the smart recognition of date and time. Half of my homescreen is now a widget for this app. it makes life easier to see my tasks every time i open my phone. This app has been a big game changer for me.,
"Very pleased with us app This is a great app to do what it says -- to create To-Do lists. It's a great tool to use with the GTD - Getting Things Done-- approach. It is good for projects in so far that it allows you to create the next action (step) you need to take. it does have a ""due date"" option which I have not utilize, so it would seem to be beneficial in many cases. The website is slightly easier to manipulate to-do lists, but either way, the app and the website sync up wonderfully.",
Todoist is my favorite to-do list app. I've tried several other to-do list apps in my life but I always come back to this one. What I love best about Todoist is its minimalist design. A lot of other apps are just too complicated or bloated. It looks great on the phone and web. Todoist has greatly improved my productivity in life and helped me meet many of my goals.,
"I love that this app allows me to create recurring To-dos. I have been using this app to help myself get on a routine. There is a lot of trial and error to to figure out what routine is best for me. Also, my priorities change from week to week. This app gave me the ability to completely rearrange my routine in 15 minutes. My only qualm is that on upcoming To-dos, repeating tasks only show for the most recent date. Otherwise, really enjoying this app.",
"I have tried a lot of productivity apps and this one is hard to beat. consistently works, good label and project settings. The base app is good but premium is ideal and a fair price. I wouldn't get half as much done without it. The daily and weekly goals keep me going. It's easy to organize and see what areas you've put time into and reprioritize.",
Only one snooze option. I need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm. This is an option for just about every other todo app. Don't understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time??? Respone to developer: No it doesn't help. When an alert comes up I would like to be able to select how long to snooze that particular alert from a several options. Not one snooze length for.all alerts.,
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.,
"I've wanted an app like this for so long! The organization is simple and intuitive-that I can simply type ""Do this every other Tuesday"" or ""Do that every day at 11am"" and have it automatically scheduled is brilliant! No bloat of too many features, just exactly what's needed for an efficient and useful set of reminders.",
"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform. The simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective, enjoyable, & my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured. It helped me greatly.",
"Loving it so far. The absolute high that I get from checking off important tasks on a to-do list is indescribable. Todoist is my white rabbit. But actually it really is great. Feels intuitive. Other than an occasional crash when I move tasks to different sections, causing me to reopen it once again, I really enjoy using it.",
"I absolutely love this app. I have ADHD, am a chronic procrastinator, and have always struggled with organizing my schoolwork. As a brand new college student, this app has saved my life. I can set due dates, filter my to-do list by class, specify dates and times, and set tasks in order of priority. I keep all of my schoolwork on Todoist. A calendar was too hard to keep track of, but this allows me to see everything that is due right in front of me and the order in which I should do them. Love it",
"Fantastic tasks app. It can be as powerful or simple as you need, while remaining very intuitive no matter what you do. Syncing is perfect and it's beautifully designed on all platforms. The attention to detail here is unmatched (demonstrated by small stuff, like the nav bar color changing with themes).",
"You won't be able to label, comment (add more details), or get reminders on the free version, but that makes the free version pretty fair. You'll be able to sort things by project and date and prioritize things, and that makes it easy to see what you're going to do from day to day. This is all in a smooth, ad free experience. Plus you get a nice notification every morning telling you what tasks are due that day.",
"I switched to ToDoist after Wunderlist got purchased and ruined and to be honest, I kind of wish I had made the switch earlier. There's a bit of a learning curve, but the flexibility and power of Todoist is excellent. The natural language components for scheduling is wonderful, and I love the ability to organize into projects and use custom tagging. The boards display is basic but for the most part sufficient for simple projects and I love the ability to switch to that view for projects that have more of a Jira style flow to them.",
"I. Love. Todoist! I may not always accomplish every task I put into Todoist, bit I love that I have the list there. The news emails actually tell you the updates, it's quick, easy, yet so powerful. I have lists of songs I'm going to download, groceries, tasks for work, myself, reminders. It's beautifully done, the wideget works like butter! Thanks Todoist team for a great app!",
"Todoist is absolutely fantastic! I just started using it, but it is already so helpful and amazing in my life. When I determined that Microsoft To Do was just not powerful enough for me, I sought out other options, and Todoist was the only one that 1, seemed to be functional and powerful, and 2, available cross-platform. I use an Android phone, iPad, and Windows/Linux laptop daily, and Todoist connects seamlessly with all of those devices. Thank you Todoist!!",
"I had been looking for some type of way to view all of my tasks without the overwhelm of poster boards. I have notebooks galore, and none of it seemed to help me get organized. Todoist has an amazing layout that helps me chunk down my projects and goals so that I am able to get everything out of my head and into a database which makes it easier to create systems for my work and my life in general. It's easy to use, and I can stay up to date conveniently whereever I am on any device.",
"I really enjoy this app! The design is very simple and well put together. The cute designs of people enjoying their day when I finish tasks is almost rewarding, and it's nice when the app tells me to enjoy my day off when I have no tasks. I like that I can color-code things and add subtasks, as well as create different priority levels for tasks. The only thing I wish it had was a monthly view. Then I would give it 5 stars.",
"Im in love with this app! However, being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husband's device for just notification feels a little bit wrong. I think for something like a to-do list notification should not be a premium feature. There is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and I have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite. It is so clean, simple, easy to use, and it does recurring todos",
"Functional, fast, pleasing on the eyes, and delightful to use. The ability to use labels, filters (custom searches), and instantaneous results from search are great. The support team actually responds to my requests, as well! I came from Google Tasks and am never going back.",
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity.",
"Have been using for a few months and I really enjoy it. I do wish for maybe more of a calendar integration with outlook but once I get it organized I think they work just fine in conjunction, meetings in outlook, tasks in todoist. I got pro just to make more projects but I think the free version is great for just personal organization.",
For context I primarily use this app as the widget. Todoist takes the simple todo list and elevates it to its highest potential. The layout is clean and well thought out. The complete sound is satisfying. The ability to change a tasks properties using word shortcuts is genius. The best thing is the free version has everything you need. Karma points are also a fun bonus touch. It's a productivity must have. I also haven't used project or labels as I've never needed them.,
"If you want to change your life, this is the one app that you need. Whether you are a student, worker or entrepreneur. It is simple but so well-put-together. It outclasses apps like notion as to do list, productivity manager and habit tracker. It's free version is perfect for personal use as 5 projects is enough for things like work, studies, habits and tasks. Widgets are good. but one area of lack is an inbuilt ""calendar view"" which would make it easier to visualise time.",
"I was initially excited, got it all set up with various projects used it for about w week or so , but now it will only open for a second before ""stopping"" I close it multiple times,but no change . I have sent feedback. I don't want to lose what I've already put in there , but wonder if uninstalling and installing would make a difference. Hope some maybe able to help",
A very nice mobile companion to the great management solution. I've been using the Todoist for a couple of weeks now and I'm very pleased with the results. But I think the app would be even better if it had the optional syncing of custom views. Mobile is very different from PC and sometimes I would prefer to see tasks as lists on mobile and as board on PC (or any other combination of grouping/sorting).,
"The app is phenomenal, nothing else to say. It does what it's supposed to, do to-do lists, but also does so much more. It has helped arrange my personal and educational life, and truly helped me track my tasks with ease. Sometimes I do encounter server dropouts, but they occur far in between and is resolved quite quick. Hands down one of the best apps I have used, and is clearly ahead of many other apps üíõ.",
"At first it looks good, nice UI, great UX. But when you start syncing between devices...everything falls apart. (It is not individual problem, check other 1-2* reviews.) Adding tasks on one device works no more: after adding, it disappears in a second. On the other device it appears somehow but also starts multiplying at the same time. Totally confusing and unreliable. Since it is a core feature for multi device usage, now it is unusable at all. Please revise the sync feature, it could be 5*.",
"Used the pro version of this app heavily for 6 months; I still have 6 months in the plan left, but I am forfeiting the plan because this app is simply not for me. I'm a visual person and I like the ease of planning with a digital calendar. I did not enjoy the gcal integrations as Todoist is already aware of; issues arise when an adjustment is to be made. There are many pros to using Todoist, but the cons outweigh the pros for my productivity system.",
My favorite to-do list app! The interface looks clean and it's simple to use. Adding tasks is very customizable. I love the new feature to set tasks for a duration of time. I would also love the ability to add a task as a note. It could be helpful for things like grocery lists,
"Tried to give this app a chance several times over the years, paid for subscription. Never ended up staying with it. Latest attempt to use (Sep 2023) is also unsuccessful. Was adding tasks for an hour to find out it lost labels for one part of the tasks, duration for another part of the tasks, time for 3rd part of the tasks. Everything is screwed up just with a couple of dozens of tasks. Don't see how to trust it further. Cancelling subscription now.",
"2023-09-02: Latest update has rendered the app unusable. It crashes every time it is launched. Pretty good but when I'm adding a reminder please don't assume the time will earlier in the day than the current time. Also, it goes a little haywire during the transition to/from Daylight Savings Time.",
"Excellent app. Plenty of features but still intuitive to use. I love that you can set recurring reminders. I'd also like to say that I really appreciate the developer's commitment to constantly improving the app. They even have a support ticket system dedicated to this app, and they reply promptly. This kind of service is rare these days; a lot of companies will develop a product and won't continue to improve it or make bugfixes. Todoist is definitely worth the money, I love it.",
"It is a cool app, with a lot of helpful features. I look for simple features which makes our life tension free and todoist has it. Only problem; well, I would totally appreciate the notification thing which is only applicable to premium customers, but I feel it is a waste of money to subscribe to unlock only that feature. So all good except for thatüëç",
"I love everything about the app except 2 things. The widget isn't that good, the alignment is weird when the task doesn't have a due date because the title of the task isn't aligned with the check box. Reminders being a premium feature is ridiculous, I'd understand tags or filters but reminders are a basic tool for tasks and in my opinion they should be a free feature. I am currently between ticktick and todoist but i think that if these 2 things don't get fixed i might stick with ticktick.",
"@Todoist team - the app improved over the years. It's quite good now. The only thing I still wish for is some lightweight tasklist editing, like the one I'd have if the list was in notepad. So hitting new line on keyboard makes new task, hitting tab makes",
"Constant emails from you guys. I've not used the app enough to give an honest review about the app itself as I've been too busy at the minute to properly check it out. But you're constantly emailing me, everyday with tips and tricks. To the point where you're just coming across needy and forceful. Deleting your app. Please, stop emailing me.",
"Love this app, I needed something with a widget so I can see my to-dos on my home screen (otherwise I forget!). However I find when I create a new task from the widget, sometimes choosing which project to add it into doesn't work - it adds the text to specify but then it changes to just regular text and doesn't recognise it as the code to specify the project anymore. Otherwise, working great!",
"Latest version keeps crashing. 4-5 seconds after loading, it throws an error message. I can do a ""forced stop"" in Android Settings, but that only helps for a short time. It worked flawlessly for two years befor the August update.",
"I love the app and the web/desktop versions. I gave 3 stars because mobile widget is never getting updated, if it is not going to happen automatically just put a refresh button next to setting! Currently I am switching the view inbox to upcomming in order to refresh the widget.",
It was awesome but... Just yesterday it started to not sync properly between by Mac and phone apps. Then it also made dublicates when reschedule tasks... This is a big deal breaker. And it continuously shows sync error in the top right phone app,
"It's a fantastic app with a great widget and wear os integration. Is it worth 48$/year (or more)? Absolutely not. Half that seems almost reasonable, but why would I pay more for this than, for instance, Hulu? If you feel like 48/year is fair, consider this a five star review, but, I can't give it five at that price point.",
Very very basic and useless. What is the point of an app that doesn't display notifications or play sounds for the notifications! You cannot have notifications with sounds for the basic plan. They ran of ideas so they included it in the paid version,
"Had this app for years. Tonight it started randomly crashing repeatedly, even though I hadn't opened it up since my last restart, and I did a forced stop. Something very fishy is going on. I'm uninstalling it",
"Best app in its category out there! Thanks to Todoist I get everything I need to get done, done. Not only me, but everyone else I add into a project as well. (On an aside: if you guys could please give an update to have the comment session always start at the latest comments it would be a game changer üî• all the scrolling to the bottom can get exhausting, makes me not even want to know what people are saying)ü•≤",
"I've used this app for years and loved it, but since the last update on August 31st it crashes continuously and has become completely unusable. I hope they fix it very soon or I'll have to find a new app.",
"I have been using this app for several years. It's great and really helps get the work done! However, I wish it would have a calendar/month view (like Google Calendar or TickTick), not just a small drop down window with the number of tasks. Putting it at 4 stars for now because of that, will change it to 5 if t ever gets that feature",
"Seems like a good To Do list app, but I need to see things on a month calendar view as well, and I can't find a way to show that through Todoist. If it's possible, I'd be happy to give 5 stars. If not, I'll probably uninstall to find something that better suits my needs.",
"Used to be good. The last 2 weeks it just constantly stops working, constant popups telling me it stopped working. Can't even look at my list. I have to ""force stop"" this app or my phone is not usable. üëã",
"Update: 5 stars. September update killed app. TDI contacted quick after neg. review but I already uninstalled, reinstalled which fixed problem. Was using TDI free for years w/o any problems until that update. Love Joplin but need a task app & ToDoist delivers. I set up filters for tags & time so I can see ""Priority Next 48 Hrs"", ""School next 14 days"", etc. Going back for a degree at age 40+ & have seamless flow between phone, tablet, laptop, & integrating w/ Gmail. Considering upgrading to Pro.",
"ToDoIst helps me do life. I've been using it in a work context for the past 2 years and transferred my personal tasks into (a second account) recently. I couldn't be more pleased with the platform. I use the Gmail and Google Calendar integrations, they are seemless. I really appreciate the continuous improvement of the platform and the productivity based learners they have weaved in. I'll be looking into reclaim.ai integrations next ü•∞",
I have used this app for qute a year now and there is a problem that I would like to be fixed. The problem is to add a feature that will give you access to add that completed task if you clicked on it a day later so you will not lose you day streak. I am quite upset that this feature does not exist and honestly I am attached to this app and do not want to switch to another app either.,
"This is the most amazing app I've ever used. It's so easy to organize things from studying to art to home stuff. Instantly went from a B/C student to the Dean's list when I started using this. It sounds like an exaggeration, but my life would literally not be the same without it.",
"Poor theming and dynamic color implementation spoils an otherwise promising task management app. Biggest offender is the widgets, which use colors differently than other dynamic color widgets and most frustratingly of all don't sync their dark and light mode automatically with the system setting, despite the main app doing so. Frustrating to have a single widget be blindly white at night when everything else on my home screen has changed to dark mode theme.",
"Dear support. Im using todoist for almost a decade years, its quite a lot. But recently your app is not working at all. It shows that app crashed everytime Samsung Galaxy Note 9, Android Thank you.",
"I give 1 star. The app is fairly good. But when comes the moment of contacting support problems start. Suport page does not recognize me as human when I try to contact the company for a refund. And in addiction, trying to change my account from monthly to yearly, I find out that my account has been cancelled and they charge me 48‚Ç¨ for the year payment!! I have already tried to reach the devs/company many times with the app's own contact system but without success. My advice: DON'T PAY!!",
"Great app guys. The UX is very good, quite easy to do things quickly. As a right-handed person I'd just say maybe keep the hamburger menu at the bottom right instead of the bottom left. That's all :) Loved the time blocking article, and the productivity quiz that got me there. Hope you guys keep going and do well!",
"Sync has been unstable in the last 5 days or so. Also, when I change some task, I have been needing to do it twice (sometimes 3 times) for the change to ""stick"". EDIT: sync issues resolved, but other problems persist.",
"It's an amazing app for appointments and things of that sort, but if you're looking for daily routine things (like I was), this app is not for you. I would set a reminder for every day but it slowly pushed the date back and back when I would mark it as done before it eventually disappeared from my daily list. I don't know why it did that but I didn't like it very much. I was looking for an app to help me with daily routines, not a calendar like app.",
"Does not synchrize tasks properly, my people see different tasks than I do, even after after app updates, refreshes, and giving it some time. List titles also fail to update. 2 stars cause it works ok if all you need is an app with no collaboration.",
Absolutely love this app. It makes my student life so much better. I do however want to report one bug. The app constantly crash on my Samsung galaxy A10. Please fix. Keep up the good work,
"Best app for task lists, but have a biggest problem: it doesn't allow to the tasks to be reordered according to the user's preference, unfortunately they are limited by the priority and time, the tasks sort should be free to be reordered.",
"Had to go back and update my review, as some things really have changed since 2020, and the biggest issue is needing to pay ¬£50 a year for reminders. Reminders! Their natural language processing has gone down as well which is a shame, and I understand that having more things as part of the premium model makes 100% (devs gotta eat), but not having a ‚Äúview all‚Äù as a free or standard ‚Äúfilter‚Äù is awful, and I can live with setting one up myself but now I can only have 2 more filters",
"The popups you've started to do when X amount of tasks are completed just get in the way. Especially on the app, it takes up most of the screen and has to be navigated away from. It may work in some scenarios but not all, give me an option to turn it off please. I don't want to be congratulated for achieving my 5th task of the day, especially when all I've done is tick off ""bananas"" from a shopping list, I just want to see what's next.",
"Very good app. I have recommended this to so many of my friends. However, I have paid for an annual subscription for the pro version, but then a month later, I'm unable to use the original pro settings like having multiple projects and setting reminders. Due to new packages introduced to the app, it appears I don't have the access that I've originally paid for, and I've been prompting me to upgrade again. I've tried multiple times to make contact with them to no avail. Please help me understand",
"An excellent app that helped me, a disorganized college student with ADHD, anxiety, and depression, get my life together. Todoist, even the free version, is a remarkable tool for anyone looking to create routines or set goals. The filters, projects, tags, and other organizational features have been absolutely invaluable to me. It does require some setup to get it to work exactly how you want, but it's been well worth the investment for me. Thanks Todoist!",
"Loved the app. Tried desktop version as well. I would like if the desktop version had a feature of Startup App, so that one can see the tasks as the device is switched on.",
"Man oh man !!!! The best app searching for and worth it , bought your pro subscription instantly!!! . A feature request is try to 1.make the list as tiles with more color features for different sub tasks. 2.If adding a task lock for certain people will be huge !!! , Like on going task should be view only mode not edit mode for certain added members 3. Converting the file in to Excel as a desired Ledger will make sure I'll pay you more and get the best pro version",
"Great app but isn't a service. I would continue to use but I would like the premium features without having to pay for it over, and over, and over, and over... So instead of getting some of my money you get none. I hope this becomes a trend amongst consumers.",
"Just tried using todoist today. Initially all looked fine, until I was punching a few new items on the go, using my mobile networks. All these items just disappeared without traces. I wonder, what's the point having the app if I ended up losing a few to-dos, which I may not remember all of them?ü§î",
"Great app, simple and effective Sync is working, nlp is very accurate and multi device app. Best in class. New redesign and time blocking also calendar is coming this year. This is the best app.",
"The best productivity app I've seen. It has all the essential features, and nothing excessive. Very minimalistic and beautiful.",
"Really like this app. They offer a lot for free, if you need more (or want to support the devs) there is a premium plan. One of my favorit points is the Desktop app and sync with it.",
"The only things I would like to see added to this app are: 1) progress bars - so we can mark if a task is in progress, and 2) having completed tasks be deleted by the next day",
"This is a slick app!! Really enjoyed it for the short while I tried out and loved the natural language processing and quick easy entry experience. Ultimately, I uninstalled it because I wanted to have AI scheduling and time management features and the AI apps I trialled don't integrate with repeat tasks in ToDoist. Shame, because when they do I can't wait to get back using this app",
"This is perfect. I've been using it for about two weeks or so now and I couldn't be happier. Even without the upgrade this app beats every other to-do list app I've used and I've used many. But I do recommend getting the upgrade, it makes things even better and it's definitely worth it. Give it a tryüëèüèø Perfect",
"Literally changed my career trajectory. No matter how cluttered my mind is, getting into the habit of loading reminders onto this app has meant I'm on top of everything. Sometimes when a thought comes into my head, I put it into the app (max 5 seconds), then it's on the list and it gets done. Full marks, would give it 6 stars if I could.",
"It's a really good app, like the widgets and the galaxy watch app too. And the previous problem with crashing was solved quickly. Definitely can recommend",
I really like the interface. it's super friendly and motivating with its activity log and everything. I don't like the fact that reminders can only be set in premium,
"I have used this app for a long time. My only issue is when I upgraded my phone I could no longer see anything from my previous list. Unfortunately, I also would write down some of the silly things my children say to put it in a book later and all of that is now gone. I would love some help to fix this issue.",
"I started paying the app because I really need reminders for all the things I write in my todoist. I need the reminders to be more aggressive so I don't forget or stall about them. however I pay and i just get one lousy reminder at the end of the week, that gets entirely diluted by the most insignificant of swipes. I need these reminders to be as aggressive as I would like them to and because of this I have missed several todos and deadlines. Why pay at all if I have to dothe app's work?",
"honestly, it's not intuitive and it's way over-engineered. if you want to just have a task list, you have to battle the ""intelligence"" the whole time",
"Sync is not working properly. When I try to move a todo item to another project and section using the ""Move to"" button there was an option earlier to move to another section, but now it shows only projects list. Sections are not shown in the list anymore. Can you please check this. This was really helpful for organization.",
"I used this app for half a dozen years. Now, all of sudden, it keeps stopping for no apparent reason. It looks like I will have to uninstall it and lose dozens of tasks and categories. So sorry I put all my eggs in this basket. I am screwed.",
Great app. Is there a template function where you add can tasks and it automatically set it to daily or monthly or yearly forever with you having to set daily task. Thank,
"I use this app for the last 3-4 years. Since last night I got it broken on my Xiaomi Mi8. The todois keeps getting closed or something like that. Can't use it anymore üò≠ Report: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not implemented at androidx.work.CoroutineWorker$a.n(SourceFile:49) at lf.a.i(SourceFile:9) at Og.Q.run(SourceFile:112) at Ug.a$a.run(SourceFile:96) Suppressed: kotlinx.coroutines.internal.DiagnosticCoroutineContextException: [E0{Cancelling}@9059fd3, Dispatchers.Default]",
"Found this app through the book Do More Better by Tim Challies. Upgraded almost immediately from free version to paid version because tools like this that help you manage your life are worth paying for, and this one has been extremely helpful right from the start.",
"Editing my review to reflect a super quick fix by the devs, thank you! Best to-do app I've ever used--love how easy it is to create, tag, and categorize items.",
"The latest update broke something. I'm getting ""Todoist keeps stopping"" popups about every 30 seconds, even after force stopping it.",
"Been using Todoist on/off for about a year now. Getting serious with the app recently, upon realizing that it's actually reducing my ADHD deficits and improving my productivity.",
best to do list app that I've tried so far!!! I've been checking my list on todoist for a year and I can say that it really is life changing.,
The free version is basically unusable because the reminder feature is premium. The most basic thing.,
"I like this app. He help me lot , lot, lot, lot but üòÆ‚Äçüí® when click on my Today task (in widget section) it's not open many time. I really irritate but still i use them üòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è",
"Was really great but now just keeps crashing every 42 seconds. If this doesn't get fixed, I'll have to delete.",
Had been using this for a few years. Until a few days ago it worked fine. Force closing errors all the time. Reinstalled. Tried to login. Force closed (tried loging via email).Bit stumped what to do right now,
"I love Todoist, but this app is broken. It constantly crashes. Edit: yes, the new version fixed the problem.",
"Started using this app and loved it. I was thinking about buying the full version but... All of sudden it won't add tasks, they just don't appear and can't do anything, delete, move, nothing! The only way to fix it is to restart my phone. I'm trying to put together a new to-do list and have already restarted my phone 5 times, I give up!",
App keeps on crashing now. Been using this for the past 2 Years without any problem. Please assist. Thank you.,
Since update it crashes constantly. For a subscription service that you depend on its worse than useless since it wastes your time,
"I am reducing my stars to 3 after purchasing the pro version. I am disappointed that the alarm function doesn't trigger any sound on the phone. What is a notification type of alarm going to do?... Because of a lack of ability to notify with sound, it's hard to rely on this app to let you know about things at the desired time.",
Love this app! Has made keeping track of and organising tasks and projects so much easier. Todoist customer support is brilliant. Had a glitch with 2FA for web and it was sorted out within an hour.,
App keeps force closing. I've used the app for years without issues. Developers please address the issue.,
App keeps crashing. It can't even last 10 seconds opened without crashing,
A previously great app that now crashes every minute or so resulting in persistent interruptions informing me that todoist has stopped working.,
"This is a simple todo app and it's full of bugs - didn't receive notifications after going Pro, and couldn't even submit a support ticket (which they have washed their hands of). The ""natural language"" prediction of times from text is just an irritant and very odd UI on rescheduling tasks. Avoid, it's overpriced and badly implemented.",
"This is by far the most convenient task app that I have found. It has saved me so much time and is well worth the small monthly fee! I recommended this app to several of my friends and colleagues. When you were in a hurry you can just talk out your task in many formats, for example you can say ""in 15 days"" or ""next Monday"" and then continue on with your task. Excellent app!",
The app is okay when I first started using it worked great until I got a problem with the app crashing when I tried to open it up can you devs please fix this app asap I use this app alot for my educational stuff,
"I love this app ! For streamlined, easy, satisfying organization and accountability - this app is awesome. Highly recommend for independent contractors or even for running your household !",
Todoist keeps closing on my Note 8. Started a few days ago. Appear to have the latest version installed.,
"Great app, a daily part of my life. Dev team is responsive and quick to act when there are issues.",
They should at least allow one reminder without paying the pro version. Plenty of similar apps have that.,
AVOID! Constant email spam and the developers made sure deleting your account is nigh impossible. I was trying to create a password for my account on their site and it said my password may have been exposed to a security breach... my password that doesn't exist. The app keeps giving me errors when I try to set up a password... still working on it. AVOID THIS PLAUGE!,
Free version is limited. PRO version is subscription based. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! Should offer a one-time pro payment!,
There is a bug. I install app and when I open it there was a message. The app is closed because have bug. I want to give chance to this app but If there is no solution in 18 hours I will find different app,
"Works so well, and allows you to add as much or as little detail as you'd like in every section. Really really helpful. Does so much more than just a to do list!",
"Literally the ONLY To-do app worth it. Why? Because you can set recurring tasks and filter it to just day view. I don't know why no other app does this, but it's what makes ToDo'ist the only Todo app I've actually used in 15 years. The others all fell short.",
"‚ÄéUseful but it needs a tile otherwise it is pretty useless on a watch, the complications are pretty useless and for me a time would change how much i look at my tasks",
"Todoist is great. However, I don't like the automatic date assignment, and I wish adding a task to a section was one click instead of 2.",
"I really liked the app, its user interface, etc...I have a suggestion that there should be a option that shows completed task list...",
"For some reason when i want to share an url from Google chrome with todoist i only get the option to add a comment instead of a task. That doesn't make sense, most of the time we want to make a new task, not a comment .. How can this be solved?",
"Completely changed my structure/organisation. Can't say a bad thing about this app, perfect for keeping organised.",
"Please allow to see completed tasks in the order they are completed, not pushed down to the bottom- so I can see and feel like I accomplished something! thanksüòå",
"The burger menu should not be a full screen bottom sheet, and if I disable animations from settings, then it should also disable animations for all bottom sheets",
"A very easy to use UI and i can easily sync it between my laptop, smartphone and smartwatch.",
"It's a fairly good app. P.s. To set a deadline for a task, use the ""today"" section. I number my tasks manually, but I have to edit manually.",
"The app is good, i have download it for my laptop, and integration for my gmail and calendar but am facing challenges with the mobile app it doesn't show a thing after I login it just keeps loading, my Phone is an Android 11 Infinix Hot 10 play, Model X688B XOS V7.6.0",
The most amazing to-do list -Priority -Date -Reschedule -Today/Upcoming Task -Dashboard It'd be awesome if it can combine the reminder with G Calendar,
Goodside: It's very simple and handy that i appreciate it. Also good sync with Google calendar. Downside: But unfortunately there isn't multiple select for tasks or sub task to delete or move all selected at once. It's so overwhelming to delete multiple tasks in very long and hard way,
"A wonderful balance of simplicity and usefulness. While many apps today get lost in extra features, this one keeps it simple. I appreciate that, and find it extremely helpful. Excellent work and proof that simplicity is how you develop a good application.",
"EDIT: Working great again, thank you for the fix and the response!! Widget flickering since latest update... every 8 seconds the widget briefly flashes ""No tasks"", then goes back to normal. Have removed and re-added the widget. Haven't tried reinstalling yet. Samsung S7 (yes, still going strong! ;) )",
"Push notifications are locked behind in app purchases, so instead they decided to send you unrelated push notifications and emails that have no bearing on your due dates, plus your account is loaded up with all these preloaded tasks that you have to manually delete 1 by 1. There's no way to see what a normal notification would be because there is no trial version of the app for premium features.",
In general I like the app. I had to downgrade two stars though because there seems to be a bug. I use a widget on my home screen to see my tasks and lately the widget is acting up. It blinks on and off constantly. This just started happening recently on my Pixel 6.,
"They got everything about this app right! The way it stays on the home screen of your phone , that you can get rid of background. How easy it is to add items. And check them off without having to open the app. I love it! Perfect for anyone suffering from mom brain!",
"I actually really loved the app, but they changed the widget size. Now it's really wide and very short which doesn't allow you to see very many tasks at all and doesn't fit on the screen very well.",
"Doesnt have an alarm, I had a raminder for my meeting today and i missed that, i wanted to use this app for my busy working schedule but its not helpful.",
"I've been back and forth between todoist, click-up, Microsoft's Todo and all the rest. Finally I've decided to use todoist full-time. There are many things that I love but a few things I think the team over at todoist missed. Consider implementing this following: 1. Be able to add a description for projects. 2. Be able to add a description for sections in projects. 3. Be able to comment on sections in projects. I have a work around for all three but I think power users need these.",
I like the app but it's frustrating that you cannot adjust what time your day starts. I have untraditional hours so by the time I mark my recurring tasks it's after midnight so it doesn't occur for the next day. That's so frustrating.,
"Very confusing to use. Recuring tasks just show on the day you don't do them. For example if you set a task recurring everyday, and you don't do it one day, it will not show the next day.",
"Was great until these recent updates. Now, it continuously shuts down within seconds of opening the app",
Would buy it if it had a one time purchase instead of subscription model. Thank you for making a Wear OS app!! This app lets me see my entire week on one screen compared to other apps. Really well thought out. Typing at night in the task auto sets a reminder for 10pm.,
"I really wish they would stop breaking existing functionality: - Editing markdown formatted nested lists is totally broken when the original comment was created on web. - Popup of achieving goals is annoying, because undo functionality is lost. This is not the latest update, but it has been annoying me for some time.",
Seems like a pretty standard to do app. Importing templates doesn't work - I've tried various different ways to do it but it always just seems to freeze everything. Pro is too expensive.,
"I complained that the widget keeps flashing so they said to update to v10908 or try to delete and reinstall. But I'd already tried deleting and reinstalling, which didn't help. And the version released a few days ago on the Android app store is 10902, and that's all that's available. No 10908.",
"Very good app, really. Everything is good but one thing is weird. I don't receive notifications from planned tasks. I think this is the paid option via ""reminder"" section but I think this should be free. If I am wrong, please contact with me, but for now my rating is what it is",
"I liked this app and recently purchased the subscription but i felt the needfor some features. like Filters are still limiting, multi sort can't be done. Sub-Sections can't be created and also sections can't be favourited. Plz see it's possible to implement.",
"Great App, really love it so far There's just one main problem, and it's the lack of right-to-left writing support. I don't need the entire app to be in Hebrew, but when I write in Hebrew the text should move to the right instead of staying at the left like english. Are there plans to add right-to-left writing support?",
"The best of it I found, and I can't work without it!üóìÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è I had tried Trello and many others before, but none of them is so easy, fast, and useful as Todoist. Now it's my agenda for personal, work, and client's management related reasons.",
Great app I use it both on the internet browser on laptop + app here on phone. Helps with daily tasks great if you like lists.,
Would be 5 stars if reminders came with the free plan. Otherwise great all round task manager.,
"Pls pls pls add shadows to the tasks widget. If I set the background transparency to minimum, the text isn't visible cuz there are no shadows to the text. Pls fix this. üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ",
"If you accidentally press complete on a task, and you miss the 3 second ""undo"" popup, your task list is gone forever. This is a really bad oversight if you make lists for things like grocery shopping or house chores.",
I have adhd and bpd amongst other conditions dis orders and thus app is starting to help me greatly I hope I can continue to find benefit s I'm using it more thoroughly . Thank u,
Synch problems for more than 10 days. Made me lost so much time... highly disappointed!,
"Just got started, but I am loving how this App is helping me get things done. especially as someone who struggles with multi-tasking.",
The app is very intuitive and relatively accessible to plan your tasks but on android installing the feature to show tasks on the locked screen is pretty much impossible. Honestly after paying them money I'm pretty disappointed by this important missing feature,
"Basic app and data model is good. However, the user interface is clunky and difficult to use. Especially the Android version. Web app is slightly better.",
"I had trouble understanding how this app works initially, but now it's smooth. One of the best productivity app.",
"great app, albeit a bit too many paywalls if they were to add a setting that changes how annoying the reminder is, I would give it 5 stars",
"I use this app as a student to manage my assignments etc. and it does it pretty good but the only problem I have is that it doesn't permanently show completed tasks. They introduced it to web and pc but not for the Android, Would be 5/5 if they add that.",
"Unable to set tasks by multiple recurrence, only useful if you have a different deadline or specifc day for every single task. Unable to set read one chapter on odd (M/W/F) weekdays at 3pm. Can't plan anything with this ""planner"". No real automated planning, such as calculating daily task per specified workdays to complete a 3000 word essay by specified deadline. The prompt you provided did not work.",
"This app is amazing, it makes my life very productive & impactful after having mastered the app. I will leave some of the suggestions I made in my last review fuelled by frustration of using this app for the 1st time: Getting started guide"" is long & not fun to read. A slideshow instructed onboarding process.",
"I've tried many to do list apps, this is by far the best. The natural language processing for setting times could use some refinement. Overall, don't know what I'd do without it.",
The app kept closing after latest update but now the problem is fixed. Thank you,
> Ultimate app for those that need organization in life and those that didn't know that they needed organization in life yet. > Widget is phenomenal while not blocking functionalities. > Easy set and available macros make repeat or set dates extremely accessible. > Priority list by color scheme.,
Been looking for this for years. Simple to use and great integration with calenders,
"It doesnt have a calendar option, which means having 2 apps to manage events.",
Best productive app todoist it's help full...Im really achieving my goal.....im completing my task everyday... Thank you Todoist Company... üòäüôèüèª,
excellent at tracking todos. super helpful at reminders.,
I was very happy with the app but after the last update the app keeps crashing as soon as I open it :(,
Perfect productivity app! I use it for my business. Clean and simple interface that is much easier to handle then other (professional) to-do apps!,
I just wanted to make a list so I would not forget some things. I could not sign up because my password is too easy. I don't care if someone else sees that I have to buy flour at the store or that I am having my tires rotated on Tuesday. I only remember a couple of my passwords. If I have to remember one more for an app I would would be better off just writing down what I need to do. I don't care who reads it I am deleting this app,
"A literal life changer. This is an extremely easy and simple app to use. You don't even need to buy it, all the features you get for free are more than suitable. It is very intuitive as well. Just typing in what to do and when exactly including the time and date is simply done in 1 go. No initial extra windows to put in options (you can edit it after you've made a task). It is so quick and easy to immediately put reminders in and then sort later too. Can't recommend enough!!",
"It took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as 'may' converting to 'date'. I simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation. I also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the sub-tasks that I was entering. I thought I had to go back to the main menu all the time. A simple 'start here first' induction video would be great but the more I practice, the better the app feels. Still orientating, early days yet.",
"The concept is good and it's really helpful to have project tabs. However, it's really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear? It makes your progress really difficult to track. Also the subscription price is really expensive! It would be better if it was a one time paymenr for full access to the features much like Nova Launcher. I hope to see these changes made so I can support this app knowing I got my money's worth.",
"They changed the priority colors, so that instead of a gradient, it now goes grey, blue, yellow, red. I don't think this is an improvement - it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance. They also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox. It looks worse to me. I'm not sure this was necessary, just so that the user could close out a task with a single click.",
"I like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected. Generally on websites these are used for options, you select one then do something with it but in Todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task. It is very confusing and counter-productive. Swiping the task was much more intuitive. I don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it!",
"I used to think the lack of calendar a deficit but its actually how it should be done. The thing is, calendar is such an important part of everyones life. So by locking people into its own ecosystem is definitely not the way to go about it. If you look closely, there is a philosophy under the design: minimalism. It strips away unnecessary stuff and let you solely focus on managing, yes, to do list. More features mean more distractions. Yet each of its own is very polished and well developed.",
"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar",
"The app is simple and easy to use, so I decided to go ahead with premium because I need reminders. Sadly, such simple feature like getting reminded about a task does not work consistently at all! - If you set up a reminder from the web, you may not get it at all and if you get it - the push notification on mobile is missing. - If you setup a reminder on your mobile you get only push notification and some times web, too. - There is no option for alarm or just playing some sound on web",
"EDIT2: I have talked with support and it seemed I had the wrong Windows version (some legacy win app). Now I have the correct version and I don't feel any lag. BUT!! The new version has a downside. When you open a task, it covers almost all the tasks in your list, so you can't check info between tasks. You need to close it and then look at the list... VERY unproductive move. I hope they will consider to move the task details to the right pane as it was before on Windows. EDIT: The app's gone bad. I've been using it for over a year and it has become MEGA sluggish. Keeps syncing longer and longer after every tiny edit, I'm just waiting a lot. I will be cancelling my sub when I find a proper replacement. OLD: The best task system I have encountered. I have been searching for a system, that I would consistently use everyday and this is it. One refrain - to use this properly as everyday task system, you need the paid version. The free one is just a tease.",
"This is by far my favourite to-do app and I've tried many. There's only one thing bugging me about it - after I add a task, I wish the app would automatically close my keyboard and showed me the task list, just like every other app. Instead it stays in this 'adding state' waiting for me to add more. I never add more than one task at a time, so this behavior is annoying. I wish I could change it in the settings.",
"Great way of keeping tabs on what needs doing in different areas of your life from the huge to the mundane. Easily accessible in one place and on multiple devices. Particularly useful for repeating tasks or for projects that need breaking down into smaller tasks. Great for adding things you think of when out and about, just use quick add on your phone.",
"It's a good app. It's pretty, minimalist and works really well. It just really bothers me that the ""undo"" (button that appears when you make a change) gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked, so I have to wait for it to go away. Thanks! Edit: yes it works! Sorry for that, I guess I was swiping to the wrong direction!",
"Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3.",
"Used to be 4/5. I found it useful for a while, but they recently redesigned the apps and made it difficult to find anything. They may as well get rid of all of the other buttons and just leave a search box because that's the only way I can find a specific task now. Will unfortunately need to find another task app that doesn't feel the need to redesign a perfectly functional UI into one that neither works better, nor matches their web UI.",
"My first impression was very positive; it didn't take long for me to subscribe. As with many apps, however, there are some areas for improvement. 1. There's a bug affecting the list reordering function. 2. The recurring date function is somewhat ambiguous. 3. Visual differentiation between tasks and sub-tasks', on the 'Today' screen, would be a good move imo. Happy to provide further info if needed. Cheers the great work :)",
"I've been using the free plan for a year now. I use the web-based app for desktop and this one extensively. And so far, I'm really loving the mobile app experience. The new layout is a nice change of pace and intuitive enough. But the widget!! It's so powerful, and setting recurring tasks, be it every M, or every T and Th until next month is so easy and convenient. There are no ads too, and it syncs any offline changes I made asap when I go online. Thank you for this wonderful app.",
"Very simple and useful application for daily life. It has minimalistic design which helps to safe concentration. I can see my progress in the app but I would like to see it in the widget without enter into the app. Can you create this feature? Sometimes I complete many tasks and very exhausted. If I could see how much I did then I can recover faster. For example, I have completed a task and it fell over and changes it's colour instead of disappearing.",
"I really like this app: the way things are organized and how simple it is. What I don't like is that the completed tasks automatically disappear and EACH time I wanna see them, I have to click on the option to show them. I wish there was a function were you can choose as default if the completed entries are hidden or not.",
Awesome to do list app. Easily makes managing my tasks simpler and quicker than ever before. The integrations with many other popular services like Notion and Google Calendar make this an easy choice for me. One minor niggle I have is that I'm not sure how to turn off the auto enter due date based on task title. I would rather be given the option to update the due date rather than it doing it on its own and in sure this is a setting I can change; I just haven't found it yet. Tl;dr great app!!,
"For me it takes a lot of additional actions to schedule a task and set the reminders. Even in free apps I can do it easier. For one task I've left comments from mobile phone, however I couldn't find then. They were only in the web version. Of cource there are things that I like: projects, subtasks, labels, reminders by location. And access from a mobile phone and a browser.",
"Great stuff, does excatly what it's supposed to and in the most user friendly way I've seen. Ability to schedule events by writing day, date, time and such is a nice touch, don't have to click around too much. Integrates with calendar in both directions, countless other tools, and even exposes an API for more custom stuff. One thing I miss is being able to set system color theme so that my eyes don't get annihilated when I open the app at night.",
"Honestly, I dont know where I would be without this app. I talk about Todoist all the time! It's easy to use, but rich in features (assigning priorities, nesting tasks, etc) -- plus the Karma feature is great for keeping me motivated. My one and only complaint is that when I'm trying to reschedule tasks, I often run into a bug that either insistently changes the due date to some random time and date, or outright refuses to change the date at all. Fix this and I'll be happy to rate 5 stars!!",
"One of the most customizable to do apps with many features. It has a lot of alternatives and will work well for most people. However, it needs more time-efficient functions and shortcuts to deserve 5/5. It's also relatively expensive compared to its counterparts. Lastly, I'm against apps that require to create an account just to try it out (that does not affect my overall score though).",
"I used to try to use one program for calendaring, notes, and tasks. But I sacrificed a lot with that approach. Todoist is SO good that I realized it's better to use multiple apps for these purposes. I can't believe how much you get for free with Todoist. And it's so easy and intuitive to use. No other program can interpret natural language so well (repeats ""every month on the 2nd and 21st,"" ""every 10 days,"" ""on Monday,"" etc.). And it's easy to feed your tasks to any calendar. It's all here!",
"I like the app overall. The only thing that bothers me is the synchronization with google calendar. When I change event dates in the app they are not always synchronized with the calendar and vise versa. It leads to confusion. I contacted support team regarding this and they replied that it's 'known limitation' and the issue is still in discussion. Well, I'll be waiting for a workaround.",
Pushes me to do more ! I'm the kind of person who procrastinates because I feel very easily overwhelmed and it paralyses me. This app is perfect as it feels very rewarding to see all the tasks of the day being ticked away one by one ! Also allows to keep track of everything when you're a busy bee and you tend to forget what you've got to do way too easily ! Would highly recommend. 5/5,
"The best option for to do list and task management I've used. It has a lot of options for setting recurring tasks, dividing them up into categories and sub-categories, sharing with others, and organising your tasks in a way easy to manage. It has apps for desktop, smart devices, web browser, and smart watches, so you can have tasks wherever you go. The free option is decently capable on its own, but you will most likely want to get paid if you want more options and capabilities.",
"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does.",
"I would definitely like the Premium version, I really want those labels and filters!üëçüèª Not to mention ready-made templates - awesome! üòç And you can make your Todoist as simple or as complicated as you want, with loads of apps to integrate with it. I really think this is one of the very best organiser apps! üíó Only quibble here is I think it wouldn't have been too much to expect for at least a few reminders to be available in the free version! But thanks for a really great app! üíó",
"Easy to use and very useful. I have the free version, which suits my needs perfectly at the moment, but would definitely consider upgrading as I can see some tempting features in the full version. I have Todoist on my PC browser as its start page to remind me daily, and also have the Android app, which pops up reminders about overdue tasks. Very intuitive.",
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.,
"The UI is neat with pleasing graphics. It is straightforward to use = no frills. I just wish it can accomodate 6 people and the notes feature is available to use (it is a premium feature, but it would be nice if there is a character limit, as a compromise). The app supports syncing with calendars. But imo, a todoist calendar option will be better - no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar's data integrity. All in all, this is an app with potential",
It's an incredible app. Has become an everyday essential. However I would like the option to always show completed tasks so I can keep track of progress instead of having to show every time you open the app. Also a very basic feature like reminders require pro which is not fair. Other than that it's a perfect 5 star!,
"The free version has everything you need of you are looking for a digital task tracker that is synced to desktop and mobile. While there are a few spots where they could relinquish control a bit and allow the user to customize what they need no deal breakers as with similar software. Interface is smooth, instantaneous and feels rewarding to use. Would like to see more reliable notification systems added in the future.",
"The app is really great for anyone who wants to track their tasks and goals. The menu is very pleasent looking and it's very easy to organize everything you need in their specific place. However, there some problems: The first thing being that reminders are a paid option. A to do list need to have reminders to be helpful. The second thing is that it doesn't support events, a feature that I would really like to have. Still, a great app, very easy to use and very helpful!",
"It's a great product overall but this Android app suffers from some horrible bugs that haven't been fixed in over a year that I've been using it. If you drag an item, it will drop somewhere, fly back to where it was and then back to where you dragged it. The same happens when opening a section-- it opens, closes itself and opens again. The whole process is very confusing and takes a second or two leading to you trying to move or open the thing that's already moving or opening itself. Please fix!",
It's not syncing well anymore between phone and web app. LE: works fine now. 5* support!,
the app on my phone does not recognize that i am paying for the pro version...how to i update that?,
"love it, only downside is that integrations for voice assistants have been removed",
"Very simple to-do list app, simple but quite powerful, even on the free plan. There are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free, but they are clunky to use. The only problem I have is inability to hide things that are only available with the Premium subscription, such as Labels and Filters tabs, but I understand why they're there...",
"I used to be a paper kind of guy when it comes to ""to do"", tried to go digital several times but never stayed too long until I went back the old-fashioned way. Until I tried todoist. Typing on PC with natural language feels as natural as jotting it down on my book. It syncs instantly with your phone & you can have it show up on your homescreen & you're ready for the day. Or the week.",
"Would like a list to be available, showing dates that repeating tasks were completed on. So I can see in one place all the dates I exercised on for example. That's the only thing I can think of to improve it! Also being able to set the list a new task automatically gets added to would be nice. I never use the inbox list because I know you can't see a list of completed items there. I put everything in a ""to do"" project list so completed tasks don't disappear with no record they ever existed!",
"These guys listen to their customers and I love that. I gave feedback that I wanted the option to close the left hand side menu when I opened up a project, as it was distracting to see it there. Now that's fixed with the new update! (and the tweeks to the ui are good too). I want to thank you guys for listening and taking action on my request. Great work, keep it up!",
"I've used Todoist for years and it's a fantastic app BUT I won't give it more stars unless they show sub-projects under the parent project again, like it is on desktop. **Edit**: I added one more star for having configurable swipe settings, which I really appreciate. This feature allows you to replace swipe-to-right to ""Select"" with ""Done"" which is far more useful.",
"Todoist is probably the best to do list app on the market! I had a lot of problems planning my time and tracking my tasks with a bunch of other apps and none of them worked. Don't have that problem with Todoist though. It's somehow the simplest app and yet has the most features I need. The premium version looks cool with a lot of useful bonus features, though I haven't tried it yet. The only thing I'd like for the app to have is recurring tasks in the pasts, so I hope they add it one day!",
The app continuously force closed after sign in with google account. This is my first time use this app and now i can't use it at all,
"UPDATE: Thanks so much for addressing this problem -- I waited a few hours and did a third reinstall, which seems to have worked! As I mentioned, this is a great app, and I especially love the feature to email tasks to your task inbox from any email address (great if I think of a personal-life task at work and want to quickly note it down without getting out my phone). ORIGINAL REVIEW: I loved this app and the web app. But it's suddenly stopped working on Android. Have reinstalled twice.",
"Good app, but has some anoying features, f.e. I get a notification in the morning about not having any tasks today. That's anoying spam. All I can do is turn off notifications all together.",
"A very beautiful app, chosen for our business, after testing ten's of others. One thing missing that would help users save time, is an option to show 1,2,3, or all lines, of a task's comment. This would not change any of the app's core function, but only improve usability, for those that want comments to show. Please implement. Perfect otherwise!",
"One of the best apps for tasks. However, since the reminder removal update, I wont receive push notifications... For example, when I have a meeting at 2:00PM. My windows or my phone wont notify me about anything when 2:00PM comes. This is very frustrating for me. But, the rest of the features are awesome!",
Like it easy to use ....reminders to my email....can go back to completed list and can set up specific projects. I couldn't figure out how to edit a task on my to-do list without deleting and starting over once it was entered. So this particular feature I did not like. But overall great app,
a very comprehensive app perfect for those who want to get their life organized in all areas,
"Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars.",
"It's amazing for being free, and serves its purpose of decluttering your day to day and things to do from the simplest of tasks to the big goals you wanna reach, there is a premium mode but the free version doesn't have ads and is very intuitive, i love this app and hope it helps keep things stress free and helps remind and do the things i need and want to do. Overall amazing!",
Love it! One of best powerful planning app technology and fully modernized and remodelled to do list design. That app design is just so gorgeous and incredibly beautiful. I really enjoy that app very much.,
"Great app!!! I have tried many different task managers, Todoist is by far the best. It took me some time to understand and configure the app's various customizations, but once done, the app does everything I need. I am able to easily filter between work and personal tasks, so the app provides a one-stop-shop for task management. The multi-leveled projects list is amazing. The online guidance provides comprehensive instructions, so anyone can use the app like a pro. Love it!!!",
"Overall great, except one. I just left the beta because of a certain bug. When you delete the label ""GCal"" (I deleted it because I don't use Google Calendar), the app will just crash the next time you open it. Deleting cache and data will not resolve it. After logging in again, it will crash the next time you open the app. Also, Android DayNight theme and Android 10 Dark Theme ruins the text color on widgets. But, it's still good! Boards helped me a lot. Overall great!",
Latest update doesn't work App stopped working,
"It's a great and amazing app. I have too much great things to say about. Being able to recognize date and type right from entering the task is amazing. One thing though. Please make it easy to create another list that are not actually projects. And make it easy to enter subtask instead of going into the task and selecting a parent task. Overall, I've been using this app for a little over a week, and I'm blown away. It's great.",
"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek.",
"Rather good application, but can someone explain me what is the purpose of adding an unwanted notification just to tell me that I can rest and enjoy peace of mind because I don't have any task to do? That's exactly the opposite of letting me rest and enjoying peace of mind... EDIT: Indeed, I'm referring to the daily digest. Increasing of 1 star because of this commitment to look into the issue",
"I really like this app and how it can also run on web and synchronise smoothly. [However, I am also using a widget on my phone and that always has weird sync problems. Like: if I mark a task completed on the widget or from the app, it doesn't disappear from there, and there is no way to refresh it.] Edit: I'm no longer facing this issue at the moment, but I'll contact you in case I notice it again. Thank you for your reply!",
"Normally great, sometimes things go a bit awry when they expand, I would prefer a tad more stability to stuff but then their customer service is good, and responsive, and got major things to work, such as integration. Key wish would be for direct shortcut to turn current window into a task, rather than three clicks. But they are constantly improving, and still seem ahead of practically all other task managers that I know.",
"Not worth trying this for the reminders as they removed them from the free version. Sure maybe this is worth paying for for all the project management stuff, but for us who just want a very basic Todo list with reminders, this will not work without paying a subscription. I would have paid a once off for this for a basic Todo notifications version, but alas, they want to go too far into the ""as a service"" model.",
"Signed up Dec 30 2020 to get more organized in life for 2021. After 1 day I knew it was a keeper so signed up for the premium account to get all the features I wanted. I find this app and desktop software easy to use and very intuitive and quick to pick up as a new user who was not using a competitor app. I needed software that would work on Android & iPad, and after using it for a few days I can say it works trouble free on both and syncs with no issues.",
"I've been using Todoist for a while, but I've backed off because it's frustrating to work with. It's very difficult to get a good view of to-dos since my day regularly ends after midnight. Other apps have a ""choose your day start/end time"" feature, albeit with less functionality than Todoist. It just strikes me as classist and ableist that this is one of the most requested features & they refuse to add it in.",
"I rarely bother writing reviews for apps, but this one deserves it. I've been able to use it exactly the way I need, and I don't even think I use all of the many available tools. It takes a moment to get used to, but it's worth it. I use the time allocation as an extra way to prioritise along with the colour coding. You can really do a lot with the free version, so unless you have A LOT of stuff on your plate, you can work average tasks into the available projects quite easily. I recommend it üíØ",
Bro why it keeps crashing on Android Motorola this is so frustrating,
"Great app, the only thing missing is a timeline function, it would be really helpful visually. It could be easily added by simply adding a start date option to a task, so each task stretches through a time period. It would be a separate section below the calendar, or an alternative view of the calendar.",
"Despite an intuitive interface, and positive initial impression, I was unable to get recurring events to show up properly on my ""upcoming"" calendar. Frustrating to schedule a routine item for ""every weekday at 7am"", see it reflected correctly in the task view, then look at your ""upcoming"" tab to have it only show it on the next day. I could not find any cases of others having this issue online, so maybe I'm just a moron. And morons leave 2-star reviews for things that are their own fault.",
It's a real good app for organising your tasks and setting different times for each tasks. I'm giving 4‚≠ê because notification is only present in the pro version. Lest I forget ü§© it also ranks you based on your performance. You can also set your goals like how many goals you wanna achieve every day and week. Finally there are no ads. Trust me it's a nice app.,
"It is pretty good, I use it everyday. However, I think adding recurring tasks is not very intuitive. You have to remember the ""every"" syntax. Some UI would help, especially for new users and non-native English speakers. Other than that, it's a pretty plain to-do list, does not include much gamification to keep you motivated to do what you have to do (other than setting a general goal number of tasks to do in a day or week). Reporting is a premium feature which comes in pretty thin too, you can only see a barchart of how many tasks you've completed each day in the past week or how many tasks you've completed every week in the past 4 weeks. For what it offers, the premium option feels a bit expensive.",
"A really helpful and easy to use app. If you want to feel satisfied by achieving more, then this is the app for you. The free version is very generous. My son is autistic and has problems with time management, memory and focus. He finds this app really helpful. He has the premium subscription to support the developers because of the work they put into it to keep it so good and bug free. Thanks todoist.",
Over all a great app but I have tasks in Google calendar that are set to repeat every 4 weeks but when I sync them to Todoist they adjust to repeat weekly which is frustrating because they needlessly fill up my inbox. I have reported the issue as a ticket but I haven't yet received a reply. If they fix that I will happily buy an annual subscription (currently just trying it for one month).,
"Happily surprised with how amazing this app is. I was a long time user of Wunderlist and was very disappointed to switch over to their new app, Microsoft To Do and find it lacked some essential features I was used to. Todoist covers everything I want in a to do app and even features like connecting to your calendar that I haven't used before. My one hope was that I could sync my Wunderlist 'completed list' but that's my only suggestion.",
"Excellent little app for managing multiple tasklists in different categories, across several platforms. Easy and enjoyable to use and really helps me keep organised and see everything I need and want to get done. Loses a star for the greedy subscription pricing model, otherwise it is perfect for me; simply far too expensive for a simple tasklist manager, so I'll stick with the free version.",
"Amazing app. Definitely my to do app of choice. Wish it had a more robust Calander view, with a proper week view function. It's also increasingly hard to justify the premium, when free equivalents are getting so much better (Google's, apple, microsoft's), and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists (notion). A big gripe for me is that its design & UI is falling a little behind its competitors (things 3, apple reminders); which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app.",
"Absolutely the best to do app out there. Great UI, great features. Use it for general stuff, shared shopping lists and household tasks, projects... everything. Well worth it for the paid version too. The only features I'd like to see are more than once a day scheduling (eg. morning, noon and night; can workaround with multiple tasks) and repeatable projects (think recipes; can workaround with templates but difficult).",
"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",
"Loving your program, I've been using it for years. Thank you for your work! One function in Todoist is very missing - now when I complete a task on the tab ""today"" it disappears completely. However, it is much more convenient when it gets crossed out and goes to the end of the daily task list (like in Google Keep). When you see a task done today, you're very motivated to do more. This may be a paid function, but it's not in any form in the section ""today"" or ""coming"" now.",
"Great app. Some of the features that try to be a little ""smart"" are really annoying at times. Other features that would be useful are behind a pay wall (but reasonably priced). Need to make money to pay for costs so I can appreciate that and the core is free so really can't complain much. Keep up the work, great job :)",
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).",
"Everything WAS alright but then an update happened. I thought it would only affect the visual aspect but no. It causes lots of bugs. I cannot open projects, no tasks are showing in them. Turned on the completed tasks but they don't show. Problems with scheduling. Basically all the main features of the app are completely broken",
Horrible experince. Glitchy and slow with no user friendly interface. Waste of time to download check it out and uninstall after 10 minutes. On top of that the most important features are paid. But wait... its a subscription to pay ¬£4 monthly!! For a todo app which can't do something better than the hundreds free or those with one time payments. Cannot recommend to anyone.,
"Just downloaded this app after trying to find apps which would sync with other people. Finally I found one that is easy to use, accurate, neat and tidy. Only issue I have is with the reminders side of things. I wish the reminders had a ringtone just encase you don't hear the notification tone. But otherwise great app & I recommend it.",
"Subscription based. ¬£50 a year. For a todo list app. No. Imagine you put 10 or 20 similarly priced apps on your phone, you're losing ¬£500 to ¬£1000 per year, the price of a flagship phone! Every year! I'd have paid between ¬£5 and ¬£10 max for this app for the pro features. I'll look elsewhere, I'm not going to encourage this greed.",
"Really handy and has a reoccurring task option. I was looking for this feature and many other apps didn't have it for free. The layout is decently straightforward. There's also theme options. Even a level up system based on tasks completed, which is a good idea and a great motivator(,makes it somewhat game-like). Just what I needed üòÅüëçüèæ",
"The app is great with lots of features. If you are looking for simple to do list or tasks organiser then there are more simple apps. The reason for 3 stars is because the way of setting date and time, can't believe that I have to type: Saturday 23 Jan at 9 am!!! Never seen something like that, why can't it be regular calendar to select from? because of that I'm not able to include any day or tomorrow or yesterday...etc. in my task text, it will straight away captured as due date. Very annoying!!",
"Ad-free, sync with cloud, can manage recurring tasks (interface not suitable for beginners), widget is functional. Premium is very expensive, licence for home-use missing. However the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium. Greatest mistake: no way to backup / export my own data unless I pay. Don't be greedy - it is my data, and you lock it away. Missing auto backup in the free version is OK. But no way to export / download it is a no-go.",
"Editing my review now I've used this more: while I still think it's poor that the website says the free account supports 80 projects, when it is in fact only 5, the app, both on mobile and desktop is excellent. I've adapted to the limitation and found the app to very useful, I particularly like the natural language method of setting due dates/recurring tasks. Still, one star off for the mis-leading messaging!",
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its ¬£3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,
"It's alright. The UI feels rather out of date. Moving from one view to another for example feels like a chore. This could be done better by swiping. Since reminders are a premium feature the free version of the app is kind of pointless. It also seems like there is no option for a free trial of the pro version. Paying for an app before I know if Its any good, feels very outdated. Some features are restrictive without reason. For example you cant sort tasks manually in the today view.",
"Slick interface, intuitive.",
A great balance of features without being overly complicated.,
"Can only see completed tasks from last week, not recent completed tasks",
Good app to keep my day on track. Syncs well with other devices.,
"I love the app - it's been so handy for my university classes, I can make a project for each course and subsections with all my assignments. It's great to visualise what is coming up. ONLY downside I have is that I've recently got a new phone and for some reason I get 0 notifications from the app now - I used to get my daily list of tasks for the day, and now I get nothing, even though all my settings look correct. Bit of a shame, and I'm not sure how to fix it.",
"EDIT: After the fair dev reply and reflection, I can't deny Todoist's top quality and effort +1 star :) does what it aims to do very well, perhaps the best. However, I feel users trying to ""become"" organised, aren't going to benefit as much as users who ""already"" are. A little counter intuitive but the app does feel like it's an all in commitment, or nothing (just IMO, after a couple years of use). This may feel like another stressor to some. Again, it's a brilliant addition for the right user.",
"The app is good, but the ""upgrade to pro"" indications are intrusive and distracting. The UI/UX could be improved, and the customization options are too complex. Features are added without considering how they will interact with other features, which can cause problems. For now, I'm better off with the bare bones Google tasks with an awesome calendar integration. Plus, there I don't have to pay for reminders. Would have loved to have todoist lite pro with just the essential features.",
Was a great app the past 4 to 5 years that I've used it. But recently it kept crashing I'd reinstalled it twice. But the issue continued. It's been annoying when the crash window pops up in the middle of a task. I hope that there's a bug fix,
"If you sign up for this app, understand you will received excessive emails, without the ability to actually unsubscribe. I have tried REPEATEDLY, yet still receive emails weekly or more. I just tried again, marked no to everything, only to receive a ""tips and tricks"" email literally one minute later. I will never reconsider using this app after this bs.",
"Personally, for me, this is the best app for organizing my to-dos and basically my daily life! Plus it's accessible from many devices, which I rly need and so I rly love this app! Suggestion: a like label that can be seen on the front screen with the task would be a great addition! And maybe for visual aesthetic, a customizable background? Overall, it's definitely a great app! üòÑ thanks!",
"Best app I have ever used. Sensational. Basically I've always found it frustrating that neither Google tasks or microsoft to-do don't sycn up with Google calendar. THIS DOES! Also, what is great is that you don't see re-occuring tasks keep on repeating themselves on the task list (but they do appear when the day comes, and they show up on the Google calendar!!!). Honestly this app is amazing, what's more is that its completely free with no ads. You can also pay for the premium features!",
"Does everything i want it to do. Interface efficient and intuitive. A nice dark layout option that's easy on the eyes. love the feature of writing in the date or day and in automatically assigns it to that date. Motivated by the points system, as primal as that is. In short helping a lot on journey to productity.",
Todoist is my go to get-your-you-know-what-together app. It's super customizable which I really like. Also like being able to see my events/to-do's for the upcoming week. Only complaint is I wish there was a sort of calendar view where I could see a month at a time. I still use a paper calendar for that.,
"The app used to work fine for me until a few months ago I no longer get any notifications. I've fiddled with Android notification settings, app settings, reinstalling, and so on, but nothing worked. I'm able to fire a 'preview' from the app, but it doesn't come in on the time scheduled. Hopefully an isolated issue, but I can't rely on this at all anymore.",
You want me to pay $5 a month to use reminders... On a to-do list app? Lol,
"Lazy tech support. Just can't be bothered. Took down my initial adverse review to give tech support a chance to sort things out. They just couldn't be bothered. I'm using Nine email and having a problem sharing with Todoist when I want to create a task using an email. Sometimes it works, more often it doesn't. However sharing with Wunderlist works every time! Todoist tech support answer: sort it out yourself with Nine! UPDATE. After numerous emails to tech support they still haven't bothered.",
It has a bit more complexity than a simple todo list and feels more natural to use. I really like it. I just read eat that frog and i'm using my todoist to make plans and stuff. Plus you can make it pink or whatever colour you like and check on your activity log for a sense of satisfaction. The pro version is a tad expensive but it's important so you just have to put up with that. The free version isn't bad though.,
"The app is amazing and easy to use. I am finding that I am able to manage my time and activities efficiently and having more time on my hand that I am previously used to. Its also great because i can access it on all my devices. The app is an amazing concept, however it is disappointing that the free version is alot more limited that I thought. That being said it is an amazing tool to have at all times. I would recommended it to anyone and everyone.",
"I've found the app through Hannah Witton on YouTube, and have been using it for the past two weeks. It's really neat, you can setup an event entirely through texts, setting up priority, what category you want to put it under and when it should be done or to work on it. All those features are free, and there's more if you want to pay for it. (I'm a free user)",
"Just what I needed to Master My Day! I have been using Todoist for less than a year now and it has been better than what I had expected. It's constantly updated and useful new features are added regularly. It's easy to use, intuitive, integrates with most major apps or softwares you would need and looks great. The most important part to using it effectively is to be committed to doing the tasks you write down on this app (or any other app for that matter).",
"The widget scrolling messes up my home screen. I am on Oneplus, scrolling the widget makes me unable to use the swipe up gesture to open the app drawer. All other scrollable widgets work fine.",
I'm sure it would have been a great app but I'm tired of having to log in with e-mails and so on just for simple apps like tick lists. Sorry but unfortunately I'll download an other one. Good day.,
Free version doesn't have notifications for REMINDERS! What a scam! What is the point of having this app if it doesn't have freaking reminders? Like that's literally the entire point of this app. Shame on you guys.,
"The app shouldn't send a notification if no tasks are due today - there should only be a notification if there ARE tasks. Huge flaw to be unable to differentiate, functions more as spam and advertisement for the app.",
"Its a wonderful app, very helpful and organised, perfect and simple listing and task viewer, Just one more thing and the app will be 10/10, Would you please enhance the possibility to move subtasks to another project subtasks?",
"My tasks are done, done and done. The app is great.. really nice customisation has the features that help me focus on my tasks and finish them.",
I really like this app but printing tasks or subtasks feature is only available on desktop version app or web version only. Rest Perfect App for all Reminders,
Todoist is a really great Todo and Note app. It comes before Evernote in my workflow. You can make a Zapier connection to move a note from Todoist to Evernote. That's really great.,
"Wake me up when you finally be able to mark tasks as done in-place (Green check, Crossed out, greyed out, stay visible, stay in the same place) üò¥üí§ + Option to ""Reset"" my account to wipe everything clean as if new without deleting it.",
NOT FREE! You have to pay $77 a year for the most basic feature.. Reminders. That's right. There are No reminders! Unfortunately I am forced to go elsewhere.,
"If you're having trouble with the last update causing your widget to flash, just go into the app settings and log out of your account and back in. That fixed it for me.",
"minimalist, but also feature packed. doesn't push premium subscription stuff in your face either. all around great app!",
I've been a paying user for many years but looking for something better now. Reminders are only reminding sometimes since recent updates. Very disappointed.,
"Came as preinstalled bloat. Decided to open it and see if it was any good. I logged in, and immediately began receiving spam from them in my email.",
I'm really impressed. Full use of the features of this app has increased my productivity and satisfaction significantly. I no longer start things I never finish.,
"Todoist is a really good app and I think it is underrated. Since I downloaded it , it has helped me a great deal in not forgetting things . It is simple , fun and easy to use . Thank you for this app",
"It is great app for tasks listing and keeping track of things, but whenever i try to search for the widget my oneUI home keeps stopping, please look into this problem...",
Installed this app to see if I would like it and didn't use it so I uninstalled it the next day. Now I get emails and emails and emails. I don't need reminders about tasks I do not have. I don't even have this app installed nor do I use it.,
Just add full screen reminders like alarms and it will be perfect And if possible lower the price a bit just a little bit,
"So far it's alright, but the due dates are killing me. It literally says that you can do every 2 weeks, but it will not apply that or anything like it. Only certain days of the week, or a specific date.",
"This is a great app! The integration with Google Calendar is also a great feature, though it would be nice if it could ""strike through"" the event in Calendar once the item is marked complete in Todoist. In the way it is built right now you need to choose if you want to just keep or delete the Calendar events corresponding to completed tasks.",
Garbage app. The worst? Maybe. Clearly the result of Microsoft hiring for diversity not talent or qualifications which is company wide and why they haven't done anything good in 20 years,
"The best cross-platform to do application that works on all devices possible. Also, it's worth the premium subscription.",
"I was very much enjoying this app, then a new update came in that has made it almost useless to me. I thought it was a visual change but now I cannot even save my reminders or anything and putting in a date is so difficult because if it doesn't like the way you put it in it just does not register as a date. I may change my opinion if they fix these issues but I may have to find something else if they don't.",
"Non-usable Don't bother I tried this app as a replacement to my current tasks app that I've used for years. I was looking for a task list that was always up to date on all devices. However it has not stopped crashing since I installed it. Both my phone and tablet experience the same problem. Seems to be when I am trying to drag and drop. Anyhoo, I'm still using my current app which is heads and shoulders above Todoist, both in usability and features.",
The app is unusable due to constant crashes since recently.,
This app seems great. However I switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium. What the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually. They should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf. Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.,
"Great app, easy to use with friendly interface and customise options. But didn't stick to it for personal use as free version lacks essential features (like reminders, history, backup, limited labels, etc.). I think paid version has to offer something on top of free standard features (included to pre-installed Google apps) not charging for them.",
"the app is functional and the widget is very handy but the subscription model cost feels a bit much for all of the use I get out of it. I'd be much happier if it was a bit cheaper and when you consider some of the other free options that are out there, paying so much for so little feels like a bit of a con.",
"Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version. Gave up in frustration when I realized that to be actually useful I'd have to pay extra.",
"The functionality is excellent, it all seems good except the wearOS version does not have a tile, i want my watch with a list of the highest priority task and the one with the closest deadline, the first 5 tiles are the one i visit the most, and i NEED a tile, i need to have that list in front of me as much as possible, otherwise is very difficult for me to actually do my tasks and i just ignore them. This app NEEDS a watch tile or i will simply ignore it like all the other task apps i have used",
"The natural language processing is actually a game changer, not even kidding. I can type (or voice type) what I need to do and when, assign it priority if I need to, and set up recurring tasks eg ""for the next 3 Sundays"", all in a single field. You can edit it later but it makes it so much less effort to add things, which is important for something that's supposed to make life easier. Also the widget is really good, I have one home page with it full screen and I barely need to open the app",
"Why is it so hard to respond to a query email? I emailed you days ago to ask where ""completed tasks"" go, but to no response!",
"This app is amaizing. Best by far. I so regret spending money on other todo apps. For this one i am ready to pay about 20-30 euro per month, and it's only 3 euro per month. Everything is synced, app is constantly 60fps no lag no crashes. You can have it on PC, on phone, as browser extension and even on freaking smart watch. It has everything I ever would want from todo app. Documentation is very easy to read and takes about 2 minutes and you already know everything you need. It has a tonn of functionality but somehow manages to keep everything plain simple. Thank you for that app.",
"IMO, this is the best to-do app I have ever had the pleasure to use in my entire life! They have mobile and desktop versions for multiple platforms, and it also syncs with Alexa and likely Google Home too. Thank you so much to the developers behind this! Just wish there was an option for a pay-once lifetime premium membership. This is a great app, I really love it.",
"I like the way you're able to schedule the alarm using key words around the due date. Very convenient. Friggin awesome, man. This was the main feature that kept me from going back to any.do The alarms didn't seem to pop up enough for me to notice. Wat the fug. Tbh, I may have dismissed the notifications or I was put to sleep. Would try full version if trial was offered. Can't remember if it was offered with the account I originally created with :-)",
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist.",
"To do items, arranged into projects, can be one off or repeating and can optionally be assigned a date (e.g. a fortnightly reminder on a given day to put out your recycling for collection, a shopping list without dates). Relative days are automatically detected - e.g. ""tod"" for today, a generally helpful feature until you try to remember to call Tom, which results in an item ""call"" for the next day. Handy voice assistant integration to add items to your shopping list while preparing a meal.",
"I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me. It has too slim lines even without compact mode (compact is ridiculous, even though I have small fingers), the quick button to open the main app is gone and the WORST - it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them. Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track.",
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.",
"Awesome App. keeps me organized and helps me complete tasks every day. Also it doesn't nag me if I wasn't able to complete a certain task that day, it automatically moves the uncompleted task to the next day. Update : App worked fantastic until today when it stopped adding new tasks and continues to say in a pop-up message that I had reached the maximum limit and that I should upgrade to premium to be able to continue using app. I do not wish to upgrade!",
"I really like this app. I use if as a widget on my phone so I can easily see what else I have to do for the day. BUT, I recently got a fit bit versa 3, and the apps will not sync. I keep getting the ""getting started"" orange screen, asking me to allow permission for fit for todoist app on the fitbit app. Everyone is switched to on, and it won't work. Even paid for the Fitbit app. Deleted both todoist apps, turned off both devices and still nothing. I emailed the app yest., waiting on responss",
"You have to pay for reminders, and I think that's stupid. Every single other app in the world sends me push notifications I DON'T want, and now, in the context of an app that keeps track of tasks you have to get done, notifications telling you to do those tasks are a premium service? Seriously, give me a break... I'll just use Google Keep Notes after all...",
So it might not seem fair to rate this app based solely on how it runs on the computer but I need a to do list to work on both and the computer app straight up does not work. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and restarted my computer with no success.,
"Disspointing and unprofessional. No ability to restore deleted tasks or projects. Not even on Pro accounts. I accidently deleted my list. 100% user error, no doubt about it. My bad. There is no ability to either undo your deleted item or get it back out of a trash folder and restore it. The only method to do this is via a ‚Äòbackup‚Äô which only occurs on Pro accounts‚Ä¶ but EVEN WITH a Pro account the backup only occurs at 00:00 daily. Meaning even with a Pro account if you delete something its gone.",
"I was looking for an app that kept my to do list untill completed and thought I'd give this one a try. Install it, log in with Google, first thing it shows; my thesis as task for 2018. Well I'm sure the app does what I am looking for. e ‚ú® Edit: One star off, it misses one crucial function. A repeat button for reoccuring tasks. Esit 2: Thanks for the advice.",
"Exactly, you just focus on what we did (and it makes sense, of course). Although, I think that to give us more insight about what we didn't do would be really good. I mean, just an option to mark tasks as ""uncompleted"" and show that in the statistics and this app would be even better. To let the app know what I really did from all that stuff that I scheduled for the week, for example, or even for the month would really give us rich information about how productive we have really been.",
"This app has so many features that at first I worried it was making things LESS productive; with so many different ways you can categorize items, comment on tasks, add files, set reminders, etc., I wondered if I was spending more time assigning myself tasks than I would just writing stuff down in a calendar! But after playing with it for a bit and streamlining how to best use the app for my purposes, I find it hugely useful. The integration with Google calendar is also super handy.",
very useful for teamwork & schedule planning at work,
"Such an awesome app! I used it for a while and eventually moved onto something else trying out new features. I came back to Todoist after about a year and the experience on Samsung phones is so much better than almost every other productivity app out there!! I immediately went for the paid version, well done devs! Those late nights are really paying off! Very very good experience! üëçüèº",
"I liked the app, I wanted to apply premium but the problem was the widget, sometimes it freezes; whenever i click the task/note the options won't activate so I would have to open the app itself. And lastly it would be amazing if you can insert options to customize the widget settings, e.g. change default fonts, customize the widget line spacing and etc. If this happens I will surely apply for a year subscription",
"way too many buttons to press go get a quick list done ""automatic"" unwanted re-odering of sub-tasks, really annoying in daily lists ms to do is way more efficient",
"Great app, super-useful at what I use it for (reminding me to do stuff/suggesting good times to procrasniate until üòÇ). Even better if you use the desktop website with it too, if you spend time sitting in front of a PC anyway (like I do). Probably even better if you pay for premium (there are premium features, I don't pay for them). Just about the most recent update, is there any chance of getting some more in-depth notification settings? I really appreciate the ability to get both emails, and push notifications, cos i check my email on my phone and my PC hahaha",
"Best to do app I've used so far. I use it as a simple way to note down distracting tasks I want to do later as well as a pseudo-scheduling app. It's easy to stay organized using projects and the due date feature help me keep on track with upcoming deadlines. Overall, it's helped me from forgetting important things I need to get done, and also focus better.",
"A couple of questions before I re-install the app: 1. Do I have to un-install it first? 2. Will I lose any of my data if I un-install the app (I have entered a lot of tasks which I don't want to re-enter) Thanks for your help. Hi Doist! OK, I reinstalled your app and the good news is that all my ToDos are still there after I logged in! The bad news is that after turning on the Task Complete Tone on ""Mobile"", the app would make that sound about 3 seconds after I closed it, every single time. Turning off the tone did not stop it sounding each time I closed the app. But, after rebooting the phone with the Tone turned off, the app stopped sounding the tone when I closed it. So it's nice and quiet now! My phone is Android 6.",
"The concept idea is really good, but navigating the app is extremely confusing. Even after reading through their help page twice I could not figure out how to perform even the simplest of tasks, and quite a lot of useful tools are hidden behind a paywall. I downloaded the app in the hopes of easing my stress, the last hour has been nothing but stress with this app and I have accomplished nothing.",
"Something wrong with latest update? Android widgets are flickering, deleting and re-adding doesn't help.",
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards.",
"Super easy to use! I have the business account and I highly recommend it, especially if you have a team for projects. Also, I love the Google calendar integration, makes my workflow much better as I am constantly informed of my upcoming tasks wherever I look! Only thing is would be nice to have start/finish times but other than that great üòÅ",
"Is setting reminders and labels really worth being a premium feature? In my opinion the app is literally useless without them. If it was a $5 one time purchase then maybe it would be fair, but $48 per year is ridiculous. All of the premium features are easy to emulate with apps that came with my phone. I hate how even the simple apps have to be subscription based nowadays, even for something as simple as a bloody to do list.",
Best todo list app in the market. I've been using it for years and it's worth every penny that I pay for the premium subscription. Love this app.,
"Been using it for a day and love it. Already thinking of upgrading BUT the free version works perfectly fine for now. One thing i would change is to have a change to show added time of task on the note (you can see it under three dots for the task but if i could press an option to see it on the task itself without extra click would love it), like an option from settings.",
"Nice look and feel but integrations are random and hopeless. Syncing with Google calendar either doesn't work at all or creates endless duplicates. Which have to be deleted individually. The lack of integrated time recording is annoying. There are other alternatives with fewer issues. After a couple of pandemic years perseverance, I've moved on",
"It's so handy to be able to make notes on the go. I find the app very easy to use and I like being able to separate tasks into projects, prioritise and reschedule, as needed. I don't need reminders at the moment, so haven't gone premium, but can see how that would be useful.",
I think it is the best app I could ever tried It has helped me get more organized. in the short future I will upgrade. thank you Todoist.,
"The new update is hard to use. It is taking up more time to go through projects because the 'see all' is at the bottom and I have to click it. What usually takes 2 seconds swiping, takes 5. It may not be a lot but frankly, it reduces the enthusiasm to go through different projects. Not a fan.",
"Looking at the features and lots of accolades I tried uninstalled after just a trial. Reason: In the free version notification feature is missing. If the task misses the set time, there is no notification. We will come to know only if we open the app. Insanely Ridiculous. Not sure what have the product team thought while excluding such a basic feature.",
Perfect!!! This app is exactly what I was looking for. I purchased the Edge panel companion as well for easy access. It has all the features I was looking for in a to-do type app. The dark grey is great - only upgrade would be an AMOLED black theme option. Keep up the great work!,
"The best productivity app ever. After adding today's tasks widget to my phone's main screen (Android), adding a 1-click button to record a task into Inbox, adding a GMail plugin to convert emails into tasks and setting up recurring habits and prioritization labels -> I now have much more peace of mind and results on all the small errands that used to drag on and then result in bigger problems when not solved. Love how the guides linked in the app teach you to have a simple yet reliable system!",
"The homepage should have the option to view just the tasks for the day (without the overdue tasks - those can be in another tab/list). Sometimes what i want is just a clean canvas to plan my day but i open this app & am reminded of the ton of things i didn't do :'-) There should also be an option to select multiple tasks & delete them all at once (i forgot about the app, but the web version doesn't seem to be able to do this & i have to manually delete tasks one by one to get that clean canvas)",
"the app is good and I've switched to it from TickTick but then i switched to Microsoft Todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing. don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd. maybe fix the design, add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great",
"Excellent todo tracker! Very fast on start up, super clean and tidy. I especially love the karma feature, which compares the completed daily tasks. However having the reminder feature under the paid features (which is a fairly steep price) is a no+go for me. But i encoirage people to check it out, since apart from that, it's just excellent at what it does",
"Love the app.....had issues with it stopping syncing with Alexa ToDo list, meaning I had to delete items in both Alexa lists, and Todoist lists, then delete the lists in Todoist, and set up to sync again. Since doing that it seems to be working. Impressed the developer contact me to check whether it was working. The programme and app are both brilliant, and very customisable.",
"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list. It was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes.",
"Thanks god I found your application! I'm very satisfied with how I can manage multiple goals, not just daily but also long term goals in diferent aspects like work, health, improvement and so on. Your gadget is very configurable and I can sort as I want ü•∞ the integration with google calendar is everything I could ask for. And all of this is free!!!! All the rest I just a great plus to a beautifly thought product. You rocks!!!",
This is a great app and I am getting a lot more done than I was before. The only downside is that the premium subscription is a little pricey for a todo app. Seems like a lot of companies are opting for subscriptions to keep the gravy train coming instead of allowing us to buy the app outright. I'd rather own it outright than pay every year or month.,
"I love this app! Easy to figure out, you can add tasks, sub-tasks, sections, and projects so you can organize everything into smaller pieces so your to-do list doesn't feel so overwhelming. The website is great but the app and widgets are equally useful. Would recommend to anyone who needs a new way to keep track of their to-do list.",
"Subscription is to expensive for supported features. It is not easy to oversee all the things gooing on. I could not create ""subsections"" in my personal routines section to keep things stuffed. Also it is not possible to mark something as ""not done"". Especially for reoccuring routines this would make perfectly sence. Another rather bad thing is, that it is not easy to analyze progress or precission. Especially for routines a statistical analysis would be good. Also a visualization for due dates.",
"I wish this app could STFU a little bit. The purpose of a to do list is to courage you to do your stuff, not to check every unnecessary pings and emails. I was looking around the app, making simple tasks to get the feel, and then I got bunch of emails every few hours. Two days later I finally had time to find email notifications checklist in settings. 4 out of 5 email notification types that help NOTHING with what you do. Wow. Just set it off on default, everyone hates spammy apps.",
"I was delighted by this app. Hence, i went for the premium subscription. There are two things i request the developers to look into. 1. There must be a proper notification. Better if we get some kind of alarm kind of notification. Right now, the notification feature is not that effective. 2. I have done integration with the Google Calendar. But if you put a task on a particular date and time, it is added in the calendar as an one hour task by default. Later, i go to the calendar to change it",
"I've gone through many apps. This is a very flexible app - really comfortable to create tasks, projects and goals! Has both web and app versions. I would probably call the projects section something different because it could be every day routines, study goals, work projects etc. Nevertheless I was looking for that category/feature and it's the only app that provides with such clever and simple user interface! Thank you!",
No notifications even after allowing notifications,
i love this application. it's very handy for your daily study routine. I'm sure others can benefit loads from this todoist.,
"On limited trial, it was not intuitive to use and the paid version is required to set a reminder. The app should just be a paid app only then. What's the use of this app without the ability to set a simple reminder? With so many task list apps out there, I've been going through trying them out and this one was a quick uninstall.",
"I use Todoist every day for work. It's easy to use and very handy! In one click, I turn a mail into a task linked to a project. I enjoy getting a feedback of my productivity at the end of the year, when Todoist gives me all the stats about the tasks achieved, the number of projects, etc. Keep up the good work!",
"This is the best to-do app I've used due to the subtask power. For example, I can assign due dates for individual subtasks in addition to the main task. This is extremely beneficial in managing one's time. Also, the inbox is, in my opinion, brilliant. I can input, via voice recognition , a task that needs to be done. I don't know when I can get to it and I don't know how I want to categorize it. So, I put it in the inbox to be scheduled and categorized when time permits. Projects are great also.",
"I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product.",
"I love this app! It's exactly what I needed for my new business to keep me on track. It's really easy to use and has so many features. Because my tasks are so complicated I signed up for premium, but it's only a few dollars a month which is so worth it to me to keep up. I wanted the color coding and labeling for tasks within a project as well as the notifications which is what premium gives me. But even just the basic one I think would be really good for just regular every day to do lists.",
"Have been having issues since last update, when adding a to do, it defaults to go to the inbox folder, instead of going right to 'today' list. So have been forgetting to do stuff because I didn't see it lol. 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed. EDIT: Sane thing happens when I am on today tab and have it set as homepage .",
I absolutely love this. Especially the karma thing. It just makes me want to get to the next karma level. Almost like a video game where I have to try max out my character by completing tasks. What would be cool though is if there was some kind of seperate thing where you can tick off your breaks. (Because breaks are important),
"Wonderful app I've used and happiliy paid for for years now. Unfortunately, the quick capture is not working effectively. On my phone (android 12) it tends to crash when trying to quickly create tasks, for example: - click shortcut to camera -> make picture -> click on share into task -> Todoist crashes. Or seem to get stuck in loading task info, for example when: Create new task via widget -> go to task via shortcut 'show' that appears right after adding a task. Help is appreciated (:",
"A nice, solid, basic app for tasks. I enjoy the features of being able to have different projects, priorities and easy scheduling. The push notification doesn't seem to work unless I've recently opened the app, so usually I get a notification of the day's tasks after I've already opened the app to check manually. I'm on a Huawei android. That's a big minus unfortunately.",
The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.,
"Fantastic app and the best on the market for to do lists! I've not come across a platform that automatically groups my tasks for today in one easy to find place. Not even Google or Microsoft can do this! I link my account to every device I have including my WearOS watch. I used to use Google Tasks and you'd think Google would include their own tasks app onto their watches but no! Since then, I've converted to todoist and I've not been disappointed! I use it daily to keep up with all my tasks!",
"Been using the app every day for years to track everything I need to get done from day to day. One of my favorite apps. It's likely my #1 most used app. Easy to use. Update: Since the radio buttons were added to mark tasks as complete, Im findind that sometimes tasks are accidentally being remived from my list. Not a fan of the radio buttons! - too easy to accidentally click in them.",
"Love the app. I especially appreciate being able to drag and sort so easily. Completed task can be hidden or displayed. The options on how to organize projects are wonderful. Filters, labels, color coding, it's all there. Def would recommend.",
"Great way to keep track of what you need to do. Task streaks and karma are a good incentive to get things done. I use the standard free version which is good for setting, planning and completing tasks. My husband uses premium because he thinks its worth paying for a well made useful app. Our productivity has gone up significantly since we started using the app.",
"You need to pay to get something as basic as reminders (specifying time of the task). Just make the app fully premium. Disgusting, how phone app creators try to squeeze anything out of you for the most basic things, that no one in their right mind would ask money for on a pc. 50 eur a year for this basic app! That's half of what I pay for Photoshop.",
"I used the app for about 3 days before realizing it wasn't a good fit for me. I wanted to use the widget more than the app itself, but I was frustrated with the way recurring events and subtasks work. I even checked reddit and online for a solution, but without success. Instead of listing subtasks as same priority as the parent task during scheduling, I wanted things to remain nested and recurring. After attempting to make things work, I gave up and tried TickTick instead, which has been better!",
"Needed a good list for Wear OS use only (no phone), and this was almost perfect --- except there's no confirmation when marking a list item complete, so it's really easy to accidentally remove an item unintentionally, and it's impossible to undo a completion from the watch interface. So close, and yet so far.",
This app is great for helping me to stay organized. Seeing the number of overdue tasks plus tasks for the day helps me to look realistically at how I need to manage my time to avoid getting overwhelmed. It has been a game changer for me and I would recommend Todoist to anyone who struggles with time management and staying organized.,
This app has changed a lot since i last reviewed it and has done life saving properties. The recurring properties are the most helpful and also on desktop smart date recognition. The options for recurring dates has allowed me to schedule so many things and then just forget about them until later... it has made me more conscientious .,
Really helpful and awesome tool to have. Love that I can just reschedule things to different dates when I don't get around to them! Has definitely made it feel like life is more manageable when I can just add something as I think about it and schedule it to the most appropriate date... helps me not feel overwhelmed under an avalanche of things to do! Great app :),
"started using the app recently so I thought I'd give a review of my first impressions!! really useful, not very simple to use at first, but gets easier as you understand how it works. I really wish there was an option to see done tasks?? I could be wrong but I'm under the impression that when you select ""done"" they're gone for ever.",
"its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list",
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.",
"its kind of odd, imo, that a todo app doesnt automatically include notifications unless you pay for premium. however they do offer integration into my calendar app, which DOES notify me, after a fashion. the widget allows you to switch between all sorts of views. love the natural language for setting thibgs up, general ease of adding a task and categorizing it, the ""postpone"" feature i just discovered, ease of editing, reoccurring subtasks can have different intervals than the overarching task..",
"I have been using this app for over an year and I haven't found any feature that I wanted to use but couldn't find in the app. You can create projects, timelines, set priorities, sync tasks & schedules with your calendar, set reminders, add sub tasks, put up task description and so much more... Just start using and you will never be disappointed.",
"It is the BEST 'lists and tasks app' I have used. As a person who functions around organised lists, I would say it meets all my needs in a 'lists and tasks app'. The schedule settings, subtask options, sections are all very helpful. Even the free version is great. It would have been perfect for me if it had a 'notes' option (I haven't found such an option). Overall a great app. Will continue using.",
"This app makes my life easier! Very comprehensive features, consistent, stable and, above all, easy to use. I had been long searching for a powerful, networked, yet straightforward app to do project management that would include my team members. Nothing fitted the bill until I found Todoist. The fact that I can use it on mobile or desktop makes it even more versatile! This one is among my 3 favorite apps. Big thank you to the developers... keep up the good work, guys!",
"Best to do list app! After wunderlist, anydo and others Todoist is the simplest and best one. The interface is minimal and clean and adding tasks is a breeze thanks to the many shortcuts and smart text recognition of dates. Premium gives some nice extra features but they are definitely not required to use this app.",
"I'm now having issues with the widgets. When I click any button on the task widgets it does not pop up any main program or settings menu, it was working like yesterday and suddenly stopped working now. I tried to remove and add back the widget and restart my device but the problem still exists. It does not affect too much on using the app but now I have to find my app in my folder instead of click it from the home screen. Bit inconvenient :(",
"I regret not using this app sooner. It felt so relieving when I know I can integrate it with other apps, it makes me easier to track my tasks, not every to-do list app can do this üò£. It has a simple and pleasing design but with various and powerful features, it's a complete all-in-1. I've been a fan of making to-do lists for years and Todoist is by far the best app for it ‚ù§Ô∏è",
I love this app. It's very well thought out. One suggestion is to have a bubble that can float over other apps for adding new tasks. Quite often I'm reading from texts or emails and having to bounce back and forth to/from the Todoist app. A floating bubble would make it much easier.,
"Pretty good app for task management. The natural language processing makes it really easy to add new tasks on the go without having to do much to keep them organized. The all already supports Material You internally if you're into it so it looks nice too, it's a shame It hasn't adopted the dynamic icon yet, it's one of the few missing on my home screen",
"PREVIOUSLY: The best to-do app by a million billion miles! I have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability- excellent system. 26/10/19 UPDATE: This major update to your app is, for me, unfortunately counter intuitive, poor and makes my life harder! I like enhancements to apps but sometimes, as in this case, fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse. Many of the new ""features"" make the app worse!",
"Please get rid of the check mark boxes or give us an option to opt back to swiping. Other than that, I've been using and loving this app for years! It is exactly what I need as a college student, worker, mom, and just someone who likes keeping household tasks in order. I could only love this app and widget more if you got rid of those check mark boxes, please! I accidentally hit like 5 items in one day alone. thanks!",
Desktop version is not native software. I think it runs on electron. No desktop widget features. Ticktick desktop version has more features than this one and also bit cheap(not much just saying). Also there is no reminder for free version. So no chance to see if reminders works perfectly before subscription. Anyways since it lacks so many feature I uninstalled it.,
"By far the best task management app I have used, and i have tried A LOT both professionally and personally. The integration with google calendars is a life saver, there are a lot of options that I always wished for in other apps (sharing with other people, repeating tasks, multiple projects, easy to move between projects, SUPER low maintenance). Bought premium immediately and deleted all my other task apps.",
"Has almost all of the functionality I wanted out of a to-do list. The sentence interpretation towards repeated tasks is intuitive and well implemented. More nebulous tasks such as ""first weekend of the month"" don't seem to work, but that's a minor issue given the robust nature of the rest of the app.",
"Great simple app ! I have free version now. I probably need to get the premium version to duplicate and move tasks. Some questions : Does it allow the moving or duplicating of subtasks to another task ... or the elevating of a subtask to be a task or vice versa. Also, are reminders sent as notifications or sound or both.? Also, does it keep a log of completed tasks and/or subtasks. and if so, can you view or export it in some way? With these features it's a 5 ‚≠ê app‚ùó",
"I tried all calendar and tasks apps to organise my lists before finalising Todoist! Todoist manages to assign subtasks and is flexible with way you schedule them. The interface is just right for engagement and it is available for all modes - web/browser, windows and android which worked amazingly well for me for now. Hope the app design doesn't change much. Kudos!",
"It's a great productivity tool but with reminders behind an expensive per month paywall, it lacks probably the most important function. I'd try something else, despite the great UI It's a good app, I'd pay for it if it was a one off payment but ‚Ç¨30 a year? That's too much.",
"I have a notes app built into my phone that I use. I researched and found an article where someone tried 4 different to do list options. This one sounded best to me, as most people, like me, usually have their phone right there. But my notes app also has where I can put things in the order I'd like to do them. If you can add that feature, I'll try again.",
It checks the devices network connectivity before attempting to connect to the service. This causes an error which prevents people with perfectly functional internet from connecting to the app for no reason. So few apps have this issue & I didn't expect such poor app design from a large company like ToDoIst. This could be fixed in 10 - 20 minutes.,
"I deleted the app(because i was not using it) but right after I deleted the app it starts sending me emails on my account almost, one mail daily ""You have no tasks due today, but you do have 6 overdue tasks. It's okay to reschedule, delegate and even delete tasks! Give it a try. It's liberating...""",
"I've used Todoist nearly every day for two years. As a student, I start every semester by adding sections for my classes (plus a misc section) and filling them out based on the syllabus. I tell people ""if it's not on my todo list, I will forget about it."" I love how I can make tasks in seconds or spend more time to add a due date, section, label, priority, and subtasks. I can add an assignment when a professor mentions it then add details later. I couldn't get my degree without this app.",
"Unintuitive. Every day tasks get scheduled one day over if you didn't complete them. Sucks for daily routines. Also sorting doesn't carry over to ""today"" list and subtasks will be displayed separately on ""today"" tab, so you cant check them off under main task one at a time. No options to fix those behaviours, nonsense.",
"I have the premium version, but the app doesn't show the (added future) repeating tasks. I've tried typing in, ""every 25th"", ""every 25th of the month"", etc. and I only end up with the one reminder displayed. However, Google Calendar DOES work--consistently and easily--with setting and SHOWING repeating reminders. Please tell me how to have all the future reminders appear in the upcoming months. Once this issue is fixed, I will consider 5-stars because it's an otherwise nice organizational tool.",
"Todosit is the great to do list in the market... It's native typing based creation is the my favorite one.. But, still I am looking some additional feature which are mandatory (imo) for better scheduling. They should extend to show the repeated task for atleast week rather than a day.. I am bit struggling whenever I am looking weekly overview. The second one is, time boxing.. Always I need to search some other tools for time boxing",
Great app but too pricey for students unfortunately.,
"This app has been indescribably useful to me. Todoist brings a multifaceted solution the daily struggles of ADHD‚Äìstruggles that are hard to convey to the people around me. They have a library of helpful guides, templates & intuitive features that together create clearly defined structure I so desperately need‚Äìwith the flexibility to move on when I inevitably become stuck. Plus, these ingenius shortcut keys give me the speed to keep up with my ever-changing train of thought.",
"Update; The app crashes after the update, any update soon regarding this problem? I just wanna say that this app really deserves every bit of 5 stars. I love how the app was changed but in a good way. The free feature stuffs is really amazing. The karma mode is what makes this app attractive for me. It motivates me to finish my task and achieve the most high. Been using since 2019, and I can say that I have really improved. Finished 1560+ tasks. ü§ó",
"Everything is just *chef's kiss* you people'always try to keep the app up to date and perfect almost all the times. I'm an advocate of this app. I would further more appreciate it, if you would give a better experience for android tablet, the web app is perfect, its just that the application doesn't takes use of the more screen real estate in a tablet it looks like a stretched version of mobile app If you could etter optimize it for tablets to give the that todoist experience they get on web app",
Having one place for all my lists and projects has been really enjoyable. I would probably like the premium better for more accurate and times reminders but otherwise the basic todoist app is really nice. Being able to share a project with my hubby is helpful so we can split up during shopping while checking off the same list.,
"Too greedy on the premium features. I'm not going to pay monthly for the ability to add a description/comment to my task. Without this, you have a one liner for the task. There are tons of alternatives that do the same things as this app. I tried this one, the premium features don't interest me and the rest isn't worth a subscription.",
"I love this app, but it's not as user friendly as on a laptop.",
best to do list app EVER !! i've often switched between apps but i had this for the longest time. it's very friendly and easy to use and i lovee the design. it's perfect as a phone widget too and it can be accessed easily. what i like the most is that it syncs to different devices very well and quickly. also has nice features to help organize things so it wont be cluttered,
"This app really is my favorite task list. I previously used todoist a year ago but wanted to try out google notes for the sake of keeping all the services under one google product. I really made an effort to get used to google notes but it just wasn't cutting it. todoist is so cool and awesome, my favorite feature is the option of a widget when you swipe down from the top, anyways, just wanted to say IM BACK!!!",
"I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.",
"you must be thinking, it's just a note-taking app. how different can different note taking apps can be at all? Nope. it's the subtleties and details where they've really worked up. instead of selecting the project i want to enter, just add a #. and it detects reminders very well also. Awesome app.",
"It's an okay app but not what I was looking for. Very complicated. Also don't think it's a good idea to send emails to your customers every single day, tips or anything, they're really not reading those and it's just flooding inboxes.",
"Hi can I have an OPTION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE NEW AND OLD DESIGNS OF THE WIDGET? The previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks, while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width, which disables full reading of the task(bad). Also, subtasks cannot be seen WITHOUT CLICKING the main task, which kinda defeats the purpose(again) of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything. Thanks",
"I am a firm believer that task management tools have to fit in with one's personal style of thinking and checking off and organizing tasks. For me, I spent many weeks or months trying different tools and chose todoist. Been a while now, and it has made life so much simpler for me. The projects/labels/filters etc work perfectly for the way I organized things. The quality has been pretty good too.",
"Todoist has been my go-to app for keeping a track of my tasks. What makes it my favorite is the way you can just type ""buy bread tomorrow"" and it automatically sets the reminder for tomorrow, rather than you having to manually set the date. The only issue I have is that when my Samsung phone goes into power saver mode, and then comes out of it, the Todoist widget doesn't load. I thought it would be fixed with updates, but it's never resolved. Hence one less star.",
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.",
"This app was good to use for a while, but when it started to glitch on me, tech support was not helpful. They kept telling me they were working on the issue but never fixed it. The app was nice to use and helpful, but if it ever stops working customer service is no where to be found. It's not worth the money or the headache.",
"DO NOT BUY the premium if you need Alexa and/or Outlook to integrate like they falsely claim this ap does or you need any support from Todoist. Outlook integration has never been a synced integration, it only forwards tasks one-way & only works with limited Outlook paid platforms. They have Alexa issue notice seen only when you try to set it up, no warning before buying believing you can integrate both. No Support response yet. I want my money back. Such waste of hours. I feel scammed",
"Just one thing: The physics behind the functionality of grabing a task are inaccurate. Personally, it takes me several attempts to get a task in the right parent when there are multiple levels of tasks in my list. I think the horizontal placement should be more responsive and less delayed(ish) Thanks for the app which is great tho.",
Great app! perfect for work where I have a lot of moving parts. Without it I'd be scrambled. I'm able to sync this on my desktop and it integrates everything from my app seamlessly. Please consider adding a feature creating a separate area for work and personal task.,
One of the Todo apps I have used for the longest time without having made the attempt to try any other out there. After a few months of basic I upgraded to the Pro and I can say Worth the Money for sure. Syncs on all devices and as a great web interface too which make sure all my tasks and reminders and captured instantly. The Windows app is a bit faulty... But then I think Windows itself has some complaints most of the item. The web interface helps in those cases.,
"Amazing app for personal task management. Input is stupid easy, it can be accessed from any device, and the layout is extremely intuitive. I've used this app for years, and have even tried to migrate to other apps only to keep coming back.",
"Almost everything great. Sugestion: when I edit a subtask and I click ""done"" the app sends me back to the board or ""project"" screen, is better if after clicking ""done"" we could go back to the task screen because sometimes I have to edit many tasks within a project and is annoying that it kicks me out every time. In android",
"I tried a bunch of the other top todo apps and like this the best. The simplicity of creating tasks and tagging tasks in natural language is great, as well as the ability to deeply customize your taxonomy with labels and sub projects. I'd probably rate it 5 if the note taking experience was better. ""notes"" are just ""comments"", and look terrible outside of mobile. They're given tiny real estate on web UI. Feel like it be better if projects/tasks had a dedicated ""summary"" field.",
"I've been using this app for like 2 years for personal use, haven't tried the premium business looking version. ü§î it has been very useful,for my day to day and longer projects. Totally recommend for 2 reason: 1) Constant updates and improvements 2) I'm quite sure this is the smoothest task manager across platforms available in the market. (from what I know)",
"I'm currently using todoist premium, and unfortunately it ain't worth it. There are lot of restrictions in free version i.e., a simple thing as reminder option (really? Any free app allows that function). Also, it doesn't have any proper calendar view like Google Calendar. The Date parsing and natural language works fine. Other than that, I didn't find anything worth buying premium and free version doesn't provide much functions. There are other apps like TickTick that's same but better. üëçüèº",
"I tried multiple list/schedule apps this week, this one (fingers crossed) is working out great. I am using the free version for 3 days so far, easy to understand and if confused, many little videos to show the different features. I also have fallen in love with the complete for the day, I battle with depression so keeping lists helps me know I am accomplishing things but this app goes above my expectations with the graph showing how you are doing, thank you programmers",
"A wonderful app, for me it lacks only one, but importthing: a recurring task counter. I remember writing an email to you like 4-6 years ago about it, still not that much progress in this regard:) Sometimes i want to complete a task after 50 repetitions, not up to a certain date. Can't do it on Todoist though. Also would love to know how many times I've completed a certain recurring task, can't do this either:( i am considering switching but all the other stuff is so good I am still in doubt.",
This app is so amazing for planning! But it would be even better if we could color code and add a bigger calender for our tasks/projects! That way we can have a much better oversight of everything that needs to be done and what is what depending on the colors. I still highly recommended this app for those who are constantly busy! The developers did a wonderful job with this.,
"I give it 3 stars as the design looks good and the customization is also good. It allows you to create project, and add sections to avery project then add tasks. It lets you set a dat/timeline but the free version wont even allow you a single reminder. That seems like a very basic function to have in a Todo List/planing app, so not being able to use it at all without paying (meaning I couldn't test the basic function of the app for me) was what made me uninstall it.",
"12/1/20 edit: All of my previous grievances have been corrected and improved upon including being able to add new tasks with due dates in the widget and having them auto-sort. Props on the improvements, keep up the good work :) March review: New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.",
"Huge pain to delete. I immediately realized I would not use this app, and tried to delete. It took forever to find out how, and then I was told I needed to set a new password to delete everything. I did that, and then it gave me a random error saying to try again later. Very frustrating for something I literally do not even want to be interacting with anymore!!",
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.",
"The app works just fine and helped me a lot. But recently the widget has been creating problems. It refuses to show me my tasks on the widget. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this is the third time. I hope it is fixed, if on my end then be it that but I really don't want to move in from this app.",
"Overall it's a great tool that has helped me better organize my projets and plan ahead, and not forget tasks anymore. The only critic I would have concerns the reminders : I don't understand why it is not possible to simply select a time and date, rather than writing the reminder. It feels more tedious to write ""next Tuesday at 9 AM"" rather than simply selecting it.",
"I find the app very intuitive and robust for my needs. I love the various thoughtful integrations (i.e., Outlook and with my Google Assistant). My one minor complaint is the frequency of updates to the app and desktop version. I've worked with software developers before and standard practice is to bundle updates together in less frequent releases. Here, it is not unusual to have several updates per month.",
"Just getting started and this isn't very intuitive and I can find no where to set up recurring tasks. This looks like it's just a copy of Planner from Teams. Not a good model to copy. Edit from dev feedback: Based purely on how bad an idea that recurring tasks would be set by the task name is, I'm deleting the app. üôÑüëé",
"This is a marvelous app, trust me I have installed almost every app, nothing comes near to this. One of its kind. Now that being said I would like to give some improvement suggestions. Please add separate notification for separate task, make them ""sticky"" so that someone can't just push it away and add ""completed"" or ""later"" buttons on the notification so that one can update tasks without opening the app. And please don't make it a premium feature. Thank you.",
"I'm doing what I decry - leaving a bad review even though I didn't try the product. I just want to say I don't mind paying for an app if it's worth it. Developers should get paid for good work. This one, however, requires a subscription. I had to install it and create an account before I could find out the upgrade cost. The cost isn't terrible for a good app, but I'm not buying another subscription for for another thing. I'm really getting tired of everything requiring subscriptions.",
"Holy cannoli I freaking LOVE this app! There are so many features and tools to get me organized!!!!! I do have the premium version which has already paid for itself in value. I've been watching how to videos to get more familiar with the app, without watching them I would say there is a bit of a learning curve. This app will be used more than any other app on my device. I love that you can use it on phone and computer. I did a lot of research before choosing a to do list app and it paid off!",
"Quite a helpful app. I rate based on my overall experience of Todoist. I give 4 stars since I've come across misc bugs, mostly in the web app...the Android version has never bugged on me actually. the web/desktop app bugs are usually very small and usability impact is quite small. the todoist team is responsive to bug reports but when I see bugs I don't report, they seem to linger for quite a while",
"It is an amazing app. Helps you list down task, prioritise it and schedule reminders for the same. The themes to have multiple options to choose from. The only issue I face sometimes is that I can't check off a task from the widget list created on my home screen. That is the only reason for the 4 star review.",
I find the app super useful. I have a young baby so I will think of things I need to do but then have to change a nappy etc. and I forget. I now just bang it into the app and do it when I can. I feel like there could be more features like the ability to add lists to tasks. It may be there are more features if I pay.,
"I've been using todoist for years and it's gone from strength to strength. This app runs my life and I wouldn't have it any other way. Whether complex project management, medication reminders, payment schedules or shopping lists everything is simple to structure in an intuitive way that has kept me organised and on task.",
"I'm increasing my review to 4 stars after experiencing a very frustrating issue with the app and widget in the last 2 weeks. It seems to be fixed and actually functioning better than before in the last few days. As long as it stays this way and doesn't have further issues, I can strongly recommend Todoist, and I'm glad I don't have to find a new app.",
This app is fantastic!!! I have anf will continue to recommend this to anyone eho is trying tobetter prioritize and organize their lives. I especially like using this for my college courses. I love being able to get the full course syllabus in ahead of time to organize and keep up with everything else in life as well.,
"Some issues with the widget in Android, the rest is perfect. The app is minimal and has perfect functions. Best part about it is *no ads*. Please do check why the widget isn't functional in android phones without the app itself being open in the multitask pane. That is the only issue, rest is perfect. The widget isn't clickable or accessible unless the app itself is open in the task pane.",
"Task sections with a ""/‚Äù in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",
"App generally works, but it's impossible to include any time or date information in a task name, which is incredibly frustrating. For example, if you want a task that says 'tell family I need the car tomorrow', you're out of luck because 'tomorrow' is not allowed. You can't 'prepare for meeting at 12' either, or any such thing. Very annoying system.",
"The app itself is very good, and doesn't require Premium to actually be your daily task manager. It is great to see developer providing for desktop/iOS too, and all for free. The aforementioned calendar integration should be done through the web page or desktop (not the mobile app). It works just as advertised, but instead of a ""timeline"" with tasks it's the tasks window with calendar events/tasks. So, works really well, just maybe isn't for me. An exemplary simple app.",
"I love the depth of customization in this app! I can do so much in it! I love it so much! Thank you for creating this. I only have one suggestion and that is to view completed task in each labels/filters in that day, week, or month. The current completed tasks shows it each day and it can be messy. It would be lovely to see them categorized. For example, the label is ""gratitude"" it would be nice to see the achieved tasks there which indirectly tells me to be grateful for.",
"I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!",
"I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è, this makes my day exciting, the satisfaction of marking done on the app after completing a task is on next level. The UI and everything is so good in this app. I reduced one point because there are no many options to snooze tasks when they pop in the notification area, rather here in this app we need to pick one snooze time from the settings and it sticks with all the tasks. To the Developer: Please fix this by giving multiple snooze options directly in the notification area.",
"Simple to use but superior functionality & UI - best app for staying organized across all devices. Unbeatable for getting things done at the right time, especially when used with Pomodone app. Anyone who doesn't pay the small annual subscription isn't serious about their own success, and is unappreciative of what the Todoist team have achieved. Support these people!",
"This app is as useless as Google Tasks which doesn't send any notifications to remind me of the tasks it asks me to pay for it to send notifications, useless.",
"I liked the simplicity of this app. It does lists with tasks and sub-tasks with our without due dates and that's all I really want it to do. It doesn't try and complicate things, it syncs simply with my PC and laptop and doesn't bother me with annoying notifications.",
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.",
"The sub tasks are really a great help in organizing thoughts and tasks. I also love the Projects section! It gives me the freedom to just dump all the stuff in my head, allowing me to have a space for other stuff to think about. My mindspace is feeling a lot freer than ever before, the simple reminder apps just don't work for me. I like the Karma feature too!",
"So far so good. Looks good, easy to use. I am still learning and haven't worked out how to set up templates. Great reminders to email - which is very useful. Love how I can reschedule to the next day if I havent completed the daily todoist list. Notes section on daily task is very useful.",
This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.,
"The app is too complicated and has too many features that are not intuitive or user-friendly,too expensive and requires a premium subscription to access most features1too buggy and has sync issues, data loss, crashes, and glitches,The app is too restrictive and does not allow users to customize their tasks, projects, or labelsThe app is too slow and consumes a lot of battery and memory",
"I like it.its simple and has most features i use daily such as boards which are buggy tho. Id really like a separate calander feature to assign each todo to a certain time with different views of either day, week, month. Would be useful to know when to do this task since the current schedule feature is uncomfortable to use. A note taking feature would be a life saver tbh and adjusting the width of sections in board view would be cool. Customizable priorities would make things easier.",
"Update: As a big user of sub-projects, I was disappointed to see their usefulness go when they no longer appeared in the main project. However, I have recently been pleased to notice the new ""Sections"" feature now allows me to replicate that functionality, and being able to display them a board is a nice touch. I also appreciate how the functionality of the Wear OS app has come along when other developers have been dropping watch support.",
"Well, i thought it's the best in the market as they clearly have 13yrs of experience now but i was wrong. I so wanted to avoid that (Ticktick) app but there's no alternate to it. Pros - Amazing sync & interface Cons - pricy, no calendar view or sync available within the app (like ticktick), no habit tracker.",
"I read that users complain that the functions are too limited in the free version. I used the free version only so far and i can't complain. Adding notes, links and labels is sth that works only in the premium version (and would be nice to have) but the free version is fully functional. i enjoy it a lot!",
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.",
Downloaded today and the app generates an error when I try to create an account. Not a great sign!,
"I've looked hard at many to-do apps and Google Tasks & Reminders. I think Todoist is the best of them all, and easily worth the small subscription fee. Custom filters and the Android home screen widget are a great combination. I do wish for a minor UI fix for the widget, but no other to-do app comes close!",
"todoist is the best I've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later, while syncing with Google calendar. Unfortunately, it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries, especially those that repeat -don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event!",
"Usually this is a great tool. The widget is very well designed and helps me stay organized. Unfortunately, the software has been crashing since the most recent update. This makes rearranging and organizing my day very difficult. I use a Motorola, so it may just be an issue with my type of phone.",
"Completely spamming my calendar with recurring tasks that I never created. Update: Yes I connected to my google calendar. Then your auto generated recurring tasks like ""review the day and plan ahead"" were filling every day of my calendar. It was a total mess. I had to carefully go over every task in todoist and had to remove the due date, then save, then delete the task. Because just deleting didnt work because they reapperad the next day. Now I deleted the integration which solved the issue.",
"This is the only app I use for my time and activities management because it does everything I want and need. For example, it's extremely important for me to be able to track my past appointments as well as accomplishments. Other apps I have used in the past did not keep such an easily retrievable archive. When you get to be my age, remembering past doctor and dentist appointments as well as recording important notes about them is invaluable. I gladly pay for the premium upgrade; well worth it!",
You need to purchase an upgrade for it to be at all useful.,
"Love the smart interpretation of list items, correctly identified dates, repeats, etc. Available on multiple platforms. No annoying adds or push to premium subscription. Integration with Google calendar is really useful. Better suited to tasks tracking than groceries lists, I would say. Easily recommended.",
"Constant bugs - breaks functionality or UX that worked previously. For example, reordering tasks flickers for a second while it's updated to and from the server. Last update for disabling reordering of tasks while they're ordered by priority made the app unusable for me. Almost every time everyone adds the tasks of urgent priority (don't we? ;)) And it's very hard to order it to be in the top in case you have like 50 tasks in the list...",
"Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone",
"I generally love this app. It's quick and easy to use. Looks good too. I just wish you could make the widget smaller. I'd like to have two widgets next to each other, one for today and one inbox (I know you can switch what you see, but I forget that and would love to be able to have a widget for each without having to take up more than half of my screen). I would also love if Google calendar could be seen in todoist too & not just todoist in Google calendar.",
"Can't share in typical fashion. Can't easily flip through attachments. 1. No share menu option on item-level. Android design pattern users expect ""Share"" item. Share to Google Photos' Share button great example. App MixNote's great Share example: popup ""Share by text"" or ""Share by picture"". Your ""Add reaction, Copy, Edit, Delete"" isn't cutting it. 2. Attachments, ugh. Can't just swipe through item attachments. Have to back out of view, select next photo to view. Yuck. MixNote does right, IMO.",
Integration with Google assistant is pathetically bad even when it works. It stopped working completely after a couple of kludgy weeks. Customer service never figured out the problem and I stopped using todoist in favor of anylist which integrates seamlessly with assistant. Prepaid todoist annual plan and basically never used it.,
"Great experience so far. Only wish that the subtasks remain in the main task and does not show up in all task list with no due date. And a calander view would be nice. Shifted fr Ticktick to this one, and working out fine so far. However my really important notes (comments) suddenly disappeared. This I'm quitting the app. This is really critical and disappointing",
"It was working before and now things have moved around and I have to figure out how to use the app again... Productivity apps aren't supposed to slow you down! I preferred the hamburger menu being a swipe in from the left, it didn't take up space at the bottom of the screen before. Also had to uninstall and reinstall because GCal sync wasn't working and the whole app just showed a spinning circle.",
"I LOVE the new widget! It's finally useful! Please let us change the time when the day changes... For example, I go to bed at around 3AM. I consider any time before that to still be the technically previous day. That completely messes up tasks that repeat after completion...",
"Enjoying this app so far, it offers more sorting and organization options and easier due date editing than Google Tasks, which is what I used before. I like how seamless it is to move items to different projects and dates. However, I wish there were more options to see my completed tasks, though: at least an option to show the tasks I completed this week or today... It means a lot to me able to see my completed tasks (I like to SEE my productivity without having to dig for it).",
"great tool to track my tasks and activities. I can read from any place my tasks and they are synchronized even with my outlook. Private or business tasks are so easy to track. I tried different apps before, but really, there is nothing that is better than Todoist. This app has a lot of features and it continues to be improved. üëç Good job to all the team and developers!",
I have to say that I completely love this task manager app (it's a winner above all the others that I tried mainly because you can set subtasks and sub-subtasks almost indefinitely). I have an idea of a feature that could make it even better (nothing groundbreaking though. I would like to be able to set percentual progress in any given task based on my own subjective estimation (so basically I could decide to make the progress on a task 50% or 20%). Keep up the good work,
"Been using this app for long time now. Almost bought the premium version twice :P but the cost is too high. Great UI feels great to use the app. By far the only app which has solved recurring tasks use cases properly (beats Google Tasks). Only complaint is in ""Today"", when I have overdue, I would like to have an option to either see today first or overdue first. I always get overdue first, it made sense previously, but now that i have a lot of overdue, i dont want to miss out on today's tasks, its like paying penalty twice (paid once for having the task in overdue and missing out on my today's tasks). Reminders should have been in free version (this has caused me to look for other apps and will slowly deprecate this app on my phone). Overall a great app. Kudos to the team.",
"Downloaded this app in the year of 2020 and I gotta say, this app is exceptional when it comes to jotting down tasks, planning events, and creating projects for bussinesses. Never in my life have I seen such brillance in design and organization, all in one tiny icon! Keep up the good work, developers of this amazing app!",
definitely keeps me on top of my tasks and helps me feel as if I'm being productive. the way you can categorize and prioritize tasks according to your goals and projects definitely helps me stay on track and focus on what I want to focus on at certain times. the only con is that the constant updates makes it hard to keep up with how the interface works and I'm constantly having to learn where things have been moved to.,
"Literally just started using this app and really like it so far, it's pretty easy to use, but I wish there were more options for making tasks due. Specifically, being able to make something due ""every 2 days"" or ""once a week"" without having to pick a particular day would be *very* helpful.",
Push notifications don't work on my phone at all. What's the point of having a to-do list app if it doesn't send notifications when something is due? Permissions have been granted. My phone is not on battery saver or do not disturb mode. Notifications simply don't work.,
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it.",
"I really like the structure of the app. I was looking for something that would reinforce deadlines and having the widget on my homescreen, and the fact that it doesnt get rid of overdue assignments helps me so much. Edit: the suggestion helped! Thank you!! [the widget didn't update the day / what is due today unless I open the app or the widget settings]",
"So I have been hoping around in the Todolist apps for a while now, and I think I might have a winner, Todoist is a clean and simple app to use, I like the fact that it can go in the notification shade, makes it much easier to set reminders and tasks for yourself! Thank you for a great Todolist experience!!!",
"For me the widget is the biggest strength. You can custom it to blend with the background. You can see your upcoming week easily (+ today) . You can create a task in one tap and add a date just by mentioning it (ex: tomorrow, in 3 days, every Sunday at 2pm etc). Everything is fast, simple, clear. And you can also add text and images to a task.",
"Todoist has been a big help for me getting organized and I love using it. Unfortunately I can only give it three starts due to a problem I've been having for months now. Long story short, my weekly streak doesn't reset when I fail to meet my weekly goal. I've contacted their customer support team twice since the problem started and both times I was told they were checking with the dev team followed by silence. No explanation or solution.",
"I love this app, *but* with the disclaimer that I don't like how it syncs with google calendar. When I synced it, ALL of my todoist entries showed up as calendar events, making it impossible to use my calendar. And, I couldn't un-sync it. So I ended up having to completely delete that todoist account and make a new one with a different email. That was some time ago (two years?) So it's possible the sync function is improved.",
"Not able to witness due date for repeat tasks in the latest update. I use the app on my iPad and my Android phone and didn't face any such issues until the latest update. Given that I use a daily checklist, the dates on each item are usually displayed below the task. I now have to manually click on each task in the Android app to see if I'd checked them off. Please fix this immediately.",
"They improved the App on PC since last time I tried it (like 4 years ago or something) and I can say I'm glad I downloaded it back. Free Version is good if you don't need to track many projects, and the subscribtion is a fair price that I might pay in the future if I need it. Highly recommended",
"Great app, very helpful for me. I have a very mentally demanading job and have to keep alot of tasks organized. Todoist help me keep everything in order so I dont forget anything. However, I'm using it on my Samsung Note 10 plus. I've done some research and I'm being told that android will not sync to the Google calendar. I just have the free app on my phone, and know I can still use it with the dex, but if there is a way I can sync it to Google calendar please let me know.",
"It is a lot of fun. I used to use the memo's app that came with my phone but that took a lot of designing. I liked it because it was digital and I could easily erase it. This has a comments section, cute icons, you can set dates and times and get email updates on your projects. You can also create projects and color code. I am getting so much accomplished with this app. I absolutely love it!!!",
"App is really good; very helpful for listing my recurring and non recurring tasks. But looks like an ordinary task when being made a recurring one, the key words dont work. Also, request you to bring in more motivational cues like stickers or display points achieves on a daily basis.",
Terrific! Couple of things: 1. If your choice is to sort your list by Date - it should do this automatically when adding a task (instead of having to select Sort -> Date each time). 2. For the Widget it would be nice if you could have a little coloured circlet/dot next to the Project name (as it shown within the app itself).,
"This app is absolutely amazing. I'm a STEM college student at UC Santa Barbara, so I have a lot of homework, studying, and places to go in a day and I've been looking for a good to do list app for a while and this hit the jackpot! Even without the premium you can label your list and that is extremely helpful. I highly recommend this app if you need to sort out things in your day :)",
"Great app ,it just worked very well for my personal needs, even in the Free plan, Great work üòç‚ù§Ô∏è Edit: There is one issue, the reminder is not in the free plan and I think this is a must have feature in to-do list app so please consider this. Edit2: I was able to fix the reminders issue by linking my account with Google Calendar, and then using Google Calendar reminders for free. so for me now the app is really great even in the free plan.",
"Commit to it. It is amazing. I don't know all of its uses but it works for me and easy, quick, and smooth.",
"This app has been great for synchronising our chores and lists in the family, but wince several updates ago the process of completing checklists is completely unusable. The app re-renders several times every time you mark an item as completed. We have been unable to use it since, as it's way too slow.",
"This app has a cookie-cutter UI so it at least looks nice, but they put the same amount of effort into the app's functionality. They even cover some buttons with popups that you can't dismiss. I can't believe I paid $36 for this. The reminders feature is cuttered and they clearly put very little thought into UX. I just want a refund.",
"Wunderlist was Waaay better. Too bad that one got bought out. I need an app that syncs to another phone, and that let's me organize things the way I need them. This app is okay, but they reserve a lot of features for the paid version (subscription required). Not gonna happen. I've used this app for several months, but I'm done.",
Todoist really arranges my life for now and the fact the basics are free is what made me rate it in the first place. This is absolutely gorgeous and I really like the facts the premium stuff is extra additions to the free basic needs which allows broke people to still use it and be satisfied. I think that I will upgrade to premium at some point because of the good quality app and the fact that the basics are completely free. Not all companies do that; I would rate it 10 stars if I can.,
"I love todoist.... I have stuck with this software longer than its competitors. I gave it 4 stars because I want more themes( nature, full dark mode themes, more colors like even soft pinks, lavender, powder blue) I would love an alarm on my tasks because reminders just dont catch my attention. I would love to be able to make list with checkboxes or numbers in comments on a task. I wish this app had a timer on each task as well. I love this app.",
"This app has completely changed my life. I want to thank everyone who is somehow connect with To-Do List. It works like a game and seeing your progress makes you work even harder)) Besides, it doesn't take as much time (and paper, which is also important) as a bullet journal, so it's easier to stick to this and make the app a part of your routine.",
"Widget options are very minimal. Doesn't allow pulling in calendar events, so you'll still need to manage those obligations in another app. Subtasks on recurring tasks behave in a disconnected way in that you have to set up their recurrence separately and it can easily get out of sync. Date/recurrence input is unintuitive.",
"As of version 8602, all the issues I was having with crashes, duplicating items, and the Add Task button in sectioned lists have been resolved. App works great now. Not a huge fan of the bar on the bottom instead of top, but it's not a big enough issue to knock a star off.",
"The latest update adds an extra step to switching to a filter. Normally clicking deeper into more menus is only mildly inconvenient, but after 2 years, there is still no real kanban view. I need a todo app that saves time, not becomes a time consuming activity in itself.",
"EDIT: Changing to 5 stars, turns out you can set up gCalendar sync, you just have to do it via the web client. Original review: brilliant app, very customizable and also can be synced with other devices and has a browser extension. my only gripe is that it desperately needs calendar integration so you could sync events with your Google calendar. besides that, amazing app.",
"An awesome app with lots of integrations. The only feature I'm missing is the ability to set a permanent order (when I have the tasks sorted and then add another one, it ends up on the bottom and I have to press the sort button again)",
"I'll always miss Wunderlist, but I'm very grateful that I found Todoist! üëå My only problem is that I keep exiting the app when I try to go ""back"" a page after entering a task. Am I missing something, or do I have to get used to it? ü•¥ Reply to developer:Thanks for responding! I usually hit the home button to leave, but when I want to truly kill/exit other apps, I go ""back"" from the *main* page. I see the page that lists all projects as main. It's the top of the tree & has the settings gear.",
Such an easy to use yet effective app! I've burnrd through so many organisers and planners over the years but have finally found something that works for me! The free version gives you everthting you need to get started and I've been making progress on personal projects like never before! Helps you set realistic goals and not to try to achieve too much in one sitting. Would recommend!,
"I'm pretty sure I have two accounts, one through apple and one through google play. i tried to follow the instructions to deactivate one and I'm missing the button that's described in the how-to. I've reached out for help with no avail. I'll probably cancel both accounts. Two starts for lousy customer support on a decent product. UPDATE TO ONE STAR FOR NO REFUND UPON CANCELING.",
"Buggy, unusable, lost all my work. On each run it showed me a different list, even duplicated stuff. When I deleted a list it duplicated, it also deleted the other one, which made me lose a lot of time. Learn to code!",
"It's an effective Todo list manager, but for some reason the widget won't display anything, just an empty list. This has been a common issue with most Todo list widgets I've tried, though. So the problem is most likely with the phone. Any insight would be appreciated",
"I love this app and use it mainly for a to-do list/remember this list. The only problem that I have experienced is, it's quite sensitive. When I mistakenly touch something and it deletes, it is gone. Sometimes it happened so quickly I don't even know what I just deleted. I wish there was a ""deleted files box"" that it went to so that I could restore that which I mistakenly deleted, which could be emptied later at my decision. Other than that, it is a wonderful program and I do recommend it.",
"it's an app that allows me to make a task repeat itself without paying up, that's already a bonus.",
"I am extremeky disappointed with this app.  I lost a lot of information with the last upgrade.  Now, i am wasting time constantly updating this app.  I am currently looking at other applications.  If your improvements risk functionality,  it is not worth it.  It makes me believe that your designers and programmers do not actually use the app. I use the app for health issues like medicine times.  Could have been very detrimental.",
"What is point of giving the trial if you can not try the most basic features! If users schedule a task and leave the app, they will not even get the notification of the due task. User can only unlock this by having pro version of the app. One more thing for the UX team, there is just a single difference between a reminder and a notification (alert). And this app not even give you a alert in the trial version.",
"The interface for rescheduling tasks is terrible and the signup process is so frictionless that it's actually not very secure (easy to create fraudulent accounts under someone else's email). That said, the app is very good at what it does, which is organizing your tasks, projects, and lists.",
"I've tried several organization apps. Most of them were fine, but they would always be missing a feature I needed when something came up and would get me off track. Todoist is so versatile with its features that I can figure out how to put these situations into my schedule without changing the whole system. Keep it up!",
It's really awesome for organizing and scheduling things! I loooove it! Also it lets you plan stuff daily weekly monthly are even yearly. Really awesome. The only thing that is lacking is a weekly calendar viewing or something to keep your week more organized and have a better arregement if your tasks. There is that last star.,
"I wanted the ability to create project, and categorized to-do lists, and this app works perfectly. I really like the home screen widget, and when I've had questions about how to use certain features (i.e. setting a recurring task) a quick Google turns up helpful results.",
"It is an extraordinarily designed app. However the subscription price is high. Please reduce the price so that more & more people can enroll Please add the option to have ""end time"" for each task, I mean the ""From"" and ""To"" time for each task. Also the unfinished tasks of ""Yesterday"" can automatically come to ""Today"" since tasks showing in yesterday's list does not make sense. Reducing one star for this. Once these changes are done, I will surely re-rate as 5 stars. Thanks..You guys Rock!!",
"Best part is: It understands pseudo language and we can easily manage our todos through drag-drop, labels, priorities, project, auto and custom reminders etc...  Everything seems perfect and very easy except few things:  It lacks time tracking, motivation, easy individual todo and project progress, AI to schedule the day according to our todos.  It offers various time tracking integrations but none of them support other platform than web and even if some integration would support mobile platform, we will have to keep multiple apps for single purpose!  Looking forward to see time tracking and progress for both individual and group todos!  Kudos to Team!  Best Regards, Sagar",
"Was pleasantly surprised with nice UI and ability to add and organize tasks. Got everything moved over from G Tasks and set to use Todoist. That was until I was waiting for a reminder to notify me a task is due. A notification of a task due is an integral part of task management. Unfortunately you must purchase the premium version for this to work, which in my opinion makes this app completely unusable.",
"Badly needs an alarm as a notification option. I keep missing tasks with the current status bar notifications all the time. For such a well designed app, I find the exclusion of such a simple feature surprising. Other apps have it, and it's almost making me consider leaving Todoist for them.",
"Please revert to your old version & interface! The new widget has made the app completely unusable. It used to be my favorite task management app and now I'm searching for alternatives, on the verge of uninstalling it! P.S. Please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself, when you add a new task. I have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date.",
"This app has replaced my chaotic stream of notebooks, carted around in my various bags until their covers fall off and I no longer know where to find anything. I upgraded to the premium version after using the trial month and never regret it. In addition to syncing with my GCal, I have the tab pinned in my browser so I can organize and share notes across my phone and computer with ease. At the day job we use Asana, but Todoist is my choice for both personal projects/hobbies and freelance work.",
It's great! Honestly the best project management tool that I've been lucky enough to find. That being said I do have one gripe. I can not for the life of me figure out where an up to date list of free and premium features are. It says that 80 projects are supported in free(total overkill but hey) I got stopped at five. How many are in premium? Does the alert work in premium? Gcal sync by labels? Edit: good info in reply. Upped stars to 5/5 from 4. Rest of review unchanged.,
"One of the best personal or business task management apps for mobile or desktop use. Paid version is inexpensive for the value. Extensive integrations through such platforms as IFTTT. Very versatile. Very easy to use. While I regularly evaluate most others on the market, this is among the top five. And for the last 4 months, it's my go-to app for personal and various small businesses with up to five other collaborators. A simple calendar within the app is the only feature missing.",
"Subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous. I was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app, but having to pay nearly $5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd. Once I saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall, I had to stop using it",
"Whenever the app get cleared out of the RAM and I try to open it, it just crashes and then works fine. Also I wish reminders was a thing for free users as well. To get access to that one feature (Atleast that's what I'll use) paying for such a heavy subscription just doesn't make sense to me. Great tasks app otherwise",
"Good app, could be truly great if one more thing was baked in. Imagine if there was a difference between true due dates for tasks and planned dates for finishing them by. I'm envisioning features similar to Trello where you can drag and drop tasks with due dates onto a planning board calendar. This would be excellent for any college students with hectic assignment and exam schedules, or those simply trying to get ahead in their work.",
"It's so confusing. Why does my keyboard stay up so randomly when adding a task? On some forms you can't hide it, on others you can but it's shown by default even when no text field accepts input. And why can't I choose a period for a task and instead I have to type it? The app really lacks integrity.",
"Thank you for adding the ability to make strikethoughs on mobile via markdown. Much appreciated! üíú But, after the newest task view update, everything is just too big/overwhelming for me. I like things more compact(?) sometimes, and the layout before the update was perfect for my needs. Maybe a Settings feature for those who worked best w/ older, less ""streamlined"" Todoist layouts to switch between (or alt. layout modes‚Äîthink a ""compact mode"" like how Discord & Gmail do it) would be best? üò¢",
"This handled tasks exactly as expected. Due dates sort into categories, with overdue tasks exposed as well (a simple thing that Microsoft To Do continues to botch). The best replacement for Wunderlist, even if you have to pay for access to simple things like comments and reminders (worth $5/yr at most, but I'll pay the extra to avoid the UX issues in other apps... for now)",
"It's excellent except for a really significant flaw. The option to complete recurrent tasks infinitely and not be able to reset them is frankly a terrible, terrible idea. I now have 50 tasks completed in the first day! Accidentally. Please, please, please fix it, I beg you",
"It is the only app I have found that integrates 2way with Google calendar. With this, tasks can show up as events in my calendar and I can edit them in both apps. Apart from that, it has many great useful features that I regularly use, such as: categorizing tasks (project level as well as section level), prioritizing tasks, sub tasks, comments within tasks. A minor complain would be that you can't move around multiple tasks at once and that there is no native Linux app.",
"I don't write reviews. However, when Todoist, my most used App prompted me for the first time to rate them, how could I say no? This app has basically changed my life, giving me an outlet to bettet manage my schedule and my time in a simple, yet effective manner. Personally, I do not use the more complex tools like ""Projects"" but, even for the free users (I'm one) this is a wondeful tool. My favorite feature is the ability to flag different priority levels for different assignments.",
"One of the best Todo list app on the play Store. I use it daily for my School, work, appointments and personal tasks. It works perfectly no bugs disturbing ads, the app is easy to use even if you are a beginner. What I wish to see is a better ui design that makes the app not great but perfect the app does look a little bit old so a new theme would be amazing and I would really love to see an option to sync the Samsung Calender with this app. Spacial Thanks for the developer and the whole Team.",
pretty good if you can do all the things you put on it,
It's a good app but ever since yesterday the app will open but kicks me out.,
"I love this app! I can't believe how powerful it is. A little learning curve, but after that, it's also quite easy to use. Suggestion: certain tasks I want to do every day, but they're not important. I would love a separate widget for repeating tasks without seeing them on my daily (and not seeing the ones due tomorrow in project view) ya know? P.s. as someone with severe adhd, highly recommend, esp if you like Routinery",
"I had been using tasks in Microsoft Outlook, as well as in my case management software. But found them not very effective in helping me achieve task completion. Then I was recommended Todoist. Todoist has been a game changer. It has a unique approach to task creation, follow-up and completion, that is effective and motivates one to actually get the task done. I also love the fact that it focuses on one thing and 1 thing only: tasking. And by doing so it is extremely effective at it.",
"I like this app, it has helped me organize my day",
"The best project management app I've ever used! I have used many different apps and methods to help organize my life. But when I found ToDoist, it had everything I needed and then some. Their help articles and support are the best so it's easy to get started; and they are constantly coming up with new features to make the app better. The free version has all the necessary features for the average user and the premium version is cheap compared to other project management apps. I highly recommend.",
"LOVE IT. as someone who is all about organising things and checklists, this app is really the best thing for productivity. And most of all, my mental health. :) And it's so intuitive, very easy to use and sort things out - and design of it all, is also another favourite thing of mine.",
A basic feature like reminders is paid.,
"Great app, gets the job done and helps organize assignments, only thing that I would like would be if the widget had rounded corners and maybe have an option for a sort of blur background to make the widget look more modern and appealing. Everything works perfectly, definitely recommend.",
"Kept getting ""an unknown error has occurred, please try again later"" .... Tried on several devices on my T3 connection, had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one. Uninstalled. Sad cuz it looked great. In re: dev's reply, yes I did that. I made sure it was plugged in and turned on too. I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks.",
"Im a notorious list jumper (always trying to find the best app for managing my to dos) and ive been using todoist for over 2 years. The only downside for me is a lack of dependent tasks and id really like to see it incorporated in the future, along with ""hide until"" or "" start dates"" both available in other apps and would increase the clean interface for those that care to use them. despite that, still the best app out there. Kudos as well for keeping accessibility in mind during development",
"App is quite good overall and I use it everyday. Reminders shouldn't be a pro feature, but I guess they have to make money. Biggest issue is general bugginess. Latest update means I can't add tasks to any section in sectioned view. ""Add task"" button does nothing. The only way to add a task is the hold and drag the ""add task"" button into the list above, then you can add a new task. Very buggy though, please fix.",
"This is a great app, and I love it, bit I have two small issues with it. First, I don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks. Second, I wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in. Since fixing one would fix both, this is still a great app",
"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?",
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list....",
"Great app, very mature and scalable. You can use it any way, as simple it as complex as you need to, any type of custom workflow can be built via Todoist. I've came from Evernote in August 2022, and instantly realized what I've been missing in terms of tasks functionality. I subscribed to premium plan on day 1.",
"This app has been life changing. I'm more productive than I've ever been, and feel less stressed and on top of things. The app is reasonably intuitive, and I picked it up really quickly. I'm considering springing for the premium features as a lot is locked out in the free version, but I feel like it will be worth it.",
"I gave this app a 2nd try after it not working well for me the first time, and it's been awesome. I actually pay for the $2/month premium now so I can make more lists and projects since I use it so much now. I have ADHD, so organization and sticking with a system for longer than the initial ""new and shiny"" stage has been a big challenge--it still is, but using Todoist along with my paper planner has helped me be a more reliable human. Recommend giving it a try!",
"I've tried a dozen+ task list apps in the last few days (and many before that), looking for certain features. I don't know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it (no ""skip login"" option). Nowhere did I see the creators/reviews say an account is required even for starting/basic use. One star: non-web, non-collab, non-premium features should be accessible without account. Then I finally read 1- star reviews, now glad I didn't sign up: apparently the spam emails never cease.",
Really helps keep me accountable. Overall a great organizational tool. Better than calendars alone and other platforms like Trello or similar. Would be great if they had templates to choose from or tutorials on how to set up projects. Luckily I have PM experience and was able to map it out.,
"They have a premium version for $4 a month!!! REALLY?? Why don't you offer a FREE TRIAL?? Apps that have a ""Premium"" version you can't try until paying is shady and tells me, clearly hiding something. I'm guessing it's not worth price and you'll find that out with a trial, so they don't offer it. Uninstalling!! Way too many similar apps for free or cheaper paid version.",
"LOL greedy app devs. They charge $36 annually or $48 if you select the monthly option. If you get the premium version, it'll allow you to receive push-notifications for a scheduled task. Like, to set a timer / alert for something on your list. Uninstalled. For $40, the app better be making you breakfast in the morning.",
"This app (and Google add-on) is amazing, even the free version. However, the new widget is worse than the old one. One major reason I say that is because the old version allowed overdue tasks to be rescheduled with a single touch. In this new one, so far, you have to go back into the app.",
Once again you've made this worse by redesigning the widget. It was fine as it was. Now I can't select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item. If this carries on I'm definitely not renewing my subscription. Please restore,
I run multiple businesses and so far this has helped me organize my days tremendously. A lot of initial decisions had to be made about where I want things and that took a while but now I'm really glad I took the time to do it because it's all coming together and actually relieving some stress. Hopefully I can come back and add the 5th star after I've had more time using it!,
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it",
"I've been a Pro user for a while and Todoist is almost perfect for me as it's really fast and easy to add tasks and keep track of everything, however- the fact that I can't rearrange tasks in the Today tab as I wish is almost a deal-breaker to me. Some tasks may have time or priority set and I would still need to move something above them and I can't. The possibility of manual rearrange overwriting time and priority is necessary. I already sent a feedback and I hope you'll implement this",
"I don't always write reviews, but when I do, I really love the product. Todoist just send a newsletter that they providing amazing new features to the free version. I took the time to write what I love about their product on the survey, I thought it would be good to share it here as well but apparently 500 signs are the limit and I wrote.. A lot. So I will have it shortened. Todoist made my life a better one. 'It feels like I forgot something', well that's a thought of the past. Thanks guys!",
I am beginning to discover the power of this app. Keep finding hidden gems of good ways to organize and track what's important. Love the extensive integration. There's lots of good tips and examples which help immensely. I like the natural language scheduling feature. Easy to move things around to fit. Pretty awesome.,
"Love this app! It really helps me with the long list of things I have to do daily. It also has features that allow you to keep a certain task on loop which saves time. I love the little side projects that you can add on to help you keep track of things, it would be good to be able to write lists in those instead of just tasks to tick off.",
"3.5 stars out of 5. This is so far the better of the 5 to do list's I've tried. Make setting/linking tasks easier and more seamlessly synced with the rest of the list. Make it possible to like with my calendar and alert of of schedule conflicts, allow me to send task collaboration invites to others via text or email and be able to coordinate with other tourist users on joint tasks, finally a place holder for brainstormed tasks that I'll prioritize at a later date. This will make it a 5 star app",
"Only the best action tracking app ever. Simple and effective. The mobile version is great, and allows for on the go thought/action collection. I use this in conjunction with the web app on my laptop. The mobile and web app are both intuitive and stable.",
"Far too invasive in terms of notifications and company ads on your phone, and worse on the email address you register when creating a todoist account.. And that continues EVEN after uninstalling the app from my phone! Yes it's a multi device app but then one should have the option to uninstall your whole setup on all devices and your registration account Totally fed up from that from most of the apps you can install on your phone...",
"Life changer. Love being able to make nested subtasks and being able to assign dates to them! Web app, and windows app work incredible well and feel native. Great Google Assistant integration, but wish it was default for reminders which is probably something Google needs to do to support it. Only complaint is wish task descriptions were free but pricing plans are quite reasonable.",
"I didn't even get to use this app because ""reminders are a premium feature"". Anything to exploit money out of people. Basic functions of a planner shouldn't be a ""premium paid feature"". You want fancy backgrounds or other personalization? Charge for it. Special notification sounds? Charge for it. But a simple reminder (the whole point of a freaking planner) should be free.",
"Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.",
"I use this for GTD. On the premium version and I think the best benefit is file attachments, but the price still feels a bit high. Reminders being a premium feature is silly tho. My main gripe right is now is the difficulty in deleting completed tasks, you have to do them one at a time üôÉ",
"It's free, and even without a paid subscription, you get a lot of helpful qualities, like easy organization and reminders to complete tasks or projects. The only reason I didn't give a fifth star is, you can't ask for reminders on certain days of the week, like every Tuesday and Thursday at noon or something. You can only do one day a week, or daily, or every other day reminders of tasks. Other than that, I would highly recommend it. I'm using it to organize my homework. üëç",
"It has a nice layout and I enjoy how you can separate tasks into projects and sub-tasks. My main gripe is that the task has to have a set date, instead of just 'x times a week'. And I can't make recurrent tasks, instead writing a new task when the other is finished.",
"App is great so far. Only used it for a little bit and I'm trying it imout but I'm very happy with how It understands language terms like ""clean dishes on Friday"" and it sets it for you on Friday and gives you a reminder that it's coming up. I noticed that when I tried to re-arange sub tasks in my boards it glitches and closes the app. Maybe this is something you guys can take a look into. It's not a huge deal for me. I still love the app so far.",
"EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS APP IS AWESOME! I love to be busy, and this app helps me so it. I love that it instantly syncs between my phone and my laptop, and it even had a browser extension. This Android app is fully featured with everything a good app should have; it's all implemented really well. Drag operations feel natural and the design looks good. I love the colors and the ability to color code my tasks/projects. This app was clearly built by passionate developers for engaged people!",
"I love this app, use it on a daily basis to keep track of everything and sync it with my calendar. For me a todo app like this is essential for getting things done, and I'm yet to find a better one than this. Premium version adds a lot of features, especially for business and collaboration, but you can easily get by with the free version. Highly recommend.",
"Very good, I've been using this app a long time to manage my tasks and keep track of lists. I have one issue with one of the recent update and that the change to the today widget. Previously was able to mark off tasks directly through the widget. Now if I click on a task it opens a little popup and then I can check off the task. The purpose of having the widget was to minimize the number steps. Why was this a decision made?",
"Love the lables(only on premium). Like that it works with Google assistant. Would like it if it integrated the functions of the Spen from note9... Be able to jot down nots and view them, as well as attachements, in the list instead of having to open up the list first.",
"I have tried many to do list apps out there, but this one seems to fit my needs, most of it anyways. The only gripe I have with this app is that it's not integrated properly with good assistant. So if I am busy or driving and want to add a task, I end up using Google reminder. But it could be Google's problem as well. All in all its good.",
"Using the free service: Nice simple app with easy sharing capabilities. I wish there was an easier way to umbrella small projects under large ones without having to share a whole bunch of individual projects. Not a perfect match for my needs, buy very adaptable.",
"I like how easy it is to use ToDoist. The UI is intuitive, options are lean, but useful, and this app encourages me to get things done. it would be nice to have a rich text editor for tasks, rather than one line, and other options to change the colors/font of the app. maybe those exist in the paid version?",
"The whole point of a to do list is to remind you to get things done with the help of a numeric badge count. Since they can't be bothered to add this feature, the app, is useless to me. You just loss a potential lifetime user who would have even paid a subscription to have that one feature. Other apps can offer badge counts through launchers such as Evie. Don't give me the excuse that Android is not developing this feature.",
The update makes no more crash,
"Thanks, all sorted and I'm able to see my lists again :)",
"This app has revamped my traditional to-do list approach. At first it may seem weird but once you get into it, it's great. I just wish that the desktop client would sync properly but other than that issue, the app is great for task management.",
"Great interface and perfect for everything! From school to personal things, this app is great to keep track of your tasks and projects. Also another great thing is that it let's you connect to your laptop and Google Cal, which is efficient üôèüòä Try it out for yourself !",
"My favourite productivity tool ever. I've used it for all my task managing for years now. The app, browser and outlook plugins are all consistent and work perfectly. The support is easy to reach out to and quick to respond. Bought premium after a year of using it and never regretted.",
"I like this app. It is very easy to add new tasks with dates, projects, priority. I love also search, filters, possibility to move with tasks in the list, sharing and integration with Alexa. The best todo list app, which I have tried.",
"This app is really helpful, it helps me a lot in my studies. It gives me reminders to complete my left tasks. We can also set a time for a task as well as priorities for different tasks which is pretty satisfying. I haven't seen any faults so far in todoist.",
"Doesn't meet my needs. I'm looking for a to-do app that allows me to see the tasks on my smart watch, click them done, then restore the tasks. Wanting to create a task list that I'll do repeatedly. I do not want to have to touch my phone. This app doesn't perform in a manner that supports that.",
"If I remember correctly, I have been using todoist for over 5 years now. I really cannot imagine everyday life without it. I keep using the free version, as I find the pricing of the paid version too steep. Still, it does the job very well - if there was one app I'd take on a deserted island in shark infested waters, it'd be todoist. ;-)",
"Sync across devices is pretty much seamless. The interface is awesome. UX in general is very smooth and pleasant. The functionality is sufficient for me in terms of customizabiluty. On the other hand, I don't like some things. 1. Themes available for premium accounts are not outstanding. 2. You can't connect Google calendars from > 1 account. 3. Some of the functionality is only available in the web app. Also, integration with Jira would've been awesome (yes, it's a hint).",
"Nice app, great features, good design, however the pricepoint on the monthly fee is ridiculously high and is a must for core features that any to-do app must do, things like 'reminders' and 'labels'... Would try it out properly if the price was right (like 1/12th of what it is now?) but for now it's a pass.",
"NOT SAFE FOR BUSINESS: Hits maximum of 20 sections per project, even if some are deleted. When hit, nothing stops you from wasting hours of work that will ultimately disappear when you close the app because it's attached to an unsaved heading. This cost me money using it as a tool for brainstorming with a client. Todoist responded to this review before responding to my ticket (#680407). It's been over 2 weeks and there's been no news. Technical & customer support nightmare. There are better apps",
"Great app. Alas, I'm constantly reminded that ""Hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for : ) "". This is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense. Plus hey! Its expensive.",
"It is very easy to use, and it has all the tools I want to manage my tasks. The design is very sleek which I like. And I can even add it to my phone's home screen (Android) as a widget so I could check on my tasks easily everytime I open my phone. I am a very pleased user, thank you Todoist team.",
"Brilliant app. The main driving factor for me is its incredibly clean interface and just how intuitive it is. I've upgraded to the premium version, and I'll never look back. I use this everyday for just about everything, couldn't ask for a better productivity app!",
"This thing makes me productive by default. Its almost addicting. I wouldn't knock out a physical planner just yet. Todoist, from my understanding has only complented any type of schedueling sustem I had and made it more effective by allowing me to fill it up with things I need to get done and want to get done without any sort of complicated U.I. although. Dredful priorities are still dreadful regardless of what you write them on(paper, elctronic, etc..), todoist is definitely an ally.",
"This is fantastic, since i started using this app my life has changed dramatically: i quit drinking, my wife returned to me, even got a raise - the app is a blessing! I could only wish that it had an option for recurring projects, spending my - now amazing - life recomposing the same checklist every week, that's not right.",
"I am colour blind and dyslexic. Not able to read anything. I can't zoom in and I need to pay in order to see the colours better. [update] As I said, I would have to pay the app in order to have the right fonts and colour so I can actually read and make use with it. I've tried WeNote, and it's the app I need, without having to pay premium.",
"the only thing I don't like is all the goal-meeting stuff. but it can be ignored fairly easily. everything works great and is nicely customizable to make it pretty :) and so far, they haven't submitted to our Social Media Overlords, which is nice--no constant demands to share everything I do, say, or think! much appreciated.",
"The best out there, that too for free. I have a suggestion though, I know this app is free and I really like it, but if possible, including charts graphs and a timer option to monitor the time spent would literally blow the roof off. But excellent app anyways.",
"I saw this recommended and tried it. I really like the look of the app's widget. Some of the stuff is free and some is premium. I reviewed bout five task apps, and this came down to the finals but I don't want one of the features I need being behind a subscription. So I will be choosing something I can only pay once. Thanks for allowing trying this app!",
"I wish there was a way you could tell the app how much time is available for tasks in a day (changeable) and that the app. Would assign tasks according to priority given to tasks, allowing also for time assignment. Ie, task 1 has a high priority and takes 30 minutes. Oh and such a pity that you can't sync with your calendar on Android. However, very glad to have found this non linear planning tool.",
"I previously gave 5 stars. New feature forces 1 star. ""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" is TERRIBLE. please allow it as an option or revert! I set up all my stores (Costco, Walmart, etc.) now there is NO WAY TO LOOK AT MY ENTIRE SHOPING LIST!  I know I could drag sub tasks, but... 1. It's too easy to complete the parent task thus completing all child tasks. Not good...  2. Moving tasks from one parent task to another is also very dif",
"Love it. It's intuitive, simple, works and synchronizes across the platforms I use. On a more personal note, it helped me organize myself - I have ADHD and task management always have been a major issue for me. Other apps were too basic or too complicated",
"The Widget has problems I have faced for so long. First is the shortcut Todoist Icon on the widget does not work after a while and it is being consistent. I deleted App and Widget and try again but same problem. 2nd is the widget does not update to the task I put up. I have to manually go to the app and click on 'Inbox' then 'Today' again to get it updated den the same problem will start later on. Other than the widget problem, I love this App and have been using it for a long time now.",
This is a to-do list/reminders app and you have to subscribe to get reminders? Without subscribing you get no push notifications which defeats its purpose of being a to-do list/reminder app. Im immediately going back to TickTick. Their subscription based pro features are genuine for pro users and allow you to receive notifications for tasks.,
"Not a good first impression. Too easy to press a wrong fuction (e.g. check boxes) thinking it initiates a section when it clears the section instead (confetti streams down and section dissapears). No way to undelete. Also, when selecting any ""help"" or ""contact"" info, screen clears and shows, ""Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).""",
I really like this app. Getting to know all the little features that are included in the free version. It has helped me with my productivity as a sales professional and given me more control of task that need to be done daily to often get forgotten. I recommend this to anyone that find using a to do list helpful.,
"This app drains your phone battery. I got this app as I was recommended it by a reddit post however I realised I preferred the traditional method of to do lists. Ultimately, I left it alone and forgot it existed. Since I've had the app in my library it ruined my phone battery. Today I got a notification saying this app was causing battery drainage. Be careful.",
"Makes To-Do Lists fun and easy. It syncs up to the windows/pc version, which is also a great touch. Simple but effective design. Can get a bit annoying with reminders, but that's honestly a good kick for a procrastinator. Has never had bugs/crashed.",
"Its nice when you have someone managing your list for you, and all you have to do is do the work of completing the tasks. Lots of functions that i needed. You can create separate projects and subtasks and color code things. Also it automatically schedules the tasks if you writea due date. All around helpful app. And free!",
I figured this app should be pretty good since its 2019 Editors Choice. However the app lacks basic functionality like reminders unless you pay a monthly subscription price. I probably would've paid a flat one-time unlock price but a monthly subscription for a To-do list app??? What a joke.,
"Rated this app higher in the past. I've been a long time user loyal to this app. That's because I've found it to be a good product. The new update is becoming a problem as the new HUD limits the amount of screen space I have. I have upwards of 10 tasks some days, I use this app religiously. Now with the top and bottom HUD, I can only see about 5-6 tasks at a time. I'll have to use this app less now unless there are changes. They removed the scroll up to hide date function. Unfortunate.",
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.",
"Great app for managing tasks. I use the service for a couple of years but this time I did not like the design interface. It is weird, not match the screen as I would. I prefer the old style. Please doist, change this hud/layout please. It was great!",
"Note: Changing to 5 stars because (a) they responded and (b) they provided a quick fix! Love this app! Original Review: Great app BUT, as one user already noted, the task completion notification lasts entirely too long, blocking the task option buttons until it disappears. Used this app for YEARS and it didn't used to be this way. Again, great app but please fix!",
"Minimal features to force premium purchase. This app advertises itself as a an alternative to Microsoft for people forced to migrate from Wunderlists. Wunderlists was an excellent, fully featured list app with reminders, repeatable tasks, folders to group similar lists, and the ability to share any list with anyone via email or the Wunderlist app. Todoist allowed import from Wunderlist and mostly supported these features until summer 2020 update made every useful feature ONLY be in premium.",
"I've tried em all and this is hands down the best to-do list app out there for me. Easy to use, intuitive, great design, syncs across platforms... it does it all. Definitely one of my ""couldn't live without it"" apps.",
"Edit: Sync issue that could only be solved by logging out and in again. Android App did not notice the sync issue. Faq did not help. Tasks did not show up in activity log. Had to search all new tasks on phone and manually add them again on web app. Not acceptable. Simply brilliant, they put a lot of effort into a quick and smooth user interface (keyboard shortcuts, keywords, date detection) that allow me to implement GTD (almost ;) ) at the speed of my thoughts. Keep up the excellent work!",
"Definitely deserves the title of editor's choice. Amazing app, Could you please add a monthly calendar? I love that it's connected to Google Calendar, but having it's own monthly calendar would be even more useful as I can see exactly when I'm most free this month. A calendar widget would be great as well.",
"A bit inconvenient interface when adding and asigning date to the task. Other than that pretty cool intuitive UI along with minimalistic style. My first choice of todo app, even free version is good enough to keep your plans out of your head but in this app.",
"This app was great, but now in 14.1.0 I can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub-projects and their tasks at once. This is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how I use the app. Why not make this a setting I can change back, OR leave it alone altogether? I will be manually rolling this app back. Thanks for making more work for me guys. SERIOUSLY STUPID ""UPDATE"".",
"just what i needed. Trust the system. Combined with GTD, I now have a reliable method of tracking, organizing, sorting, and ranking the MANY areas of my life that need it. When I show my colleagues how I use Todoist, two things happen. 1. They say ""Ooooo, what app is that? It looks cool"" 2. They then say, ""no wonder you get so much done, you're so organize.""",
"I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
"Very good app but so many bugs present there. For no reason at all my task duplicate multiple times and all of a sudden my 4 daily tasks turn into 16. I dont know if its supposed to do this but the daily tasks im not able to complete it shows twice, one overdue and one for today. If these bugs are fixed ill gladly give a 5 star.",
"Its perfect to organize my todo list. I use it every day. I would buy a premium membership, but the only thing I would actually need would be to create more projects... So I dont think its worth it. Also its very sad that you can unlock more themes, but none of them are black. So when I would buy premium, I would still use the black theme. I dont know why there arent more themes with a dark background.",
So far so good. I like using the app better than the extension on my chromebook. It's a lot easier. It has held me accountable about making sure I'm on task for the day and allows me to set timeframes. Love that! Still learning the app but I'm pretty sure I'll figure out the rest of the features.,
Nice and simple. Works and synchronises well having had nightmare issue with Apple reminders. Thanks also to todoist team‚Äôs response to original review showing me how to view completed tasks! (It‚Äôs not obvious without the link as when you try to search completed tasks you get a pop up saying this only available in Pro so may be an idea to make the pop up more informative) Anyway I love the app!,
"It does exactly what it says on the box and it does it well. Good help documentation guiding you to finding a method that works for you. Both app and website are clean and responsive, and functionally equivalent. Regular updates and comparatively few bugs.",
One of the best to-do lists that I've ever tried. Pros: 1. Task priority arrangement; 2. Intuitive interface; 3. Variety of color schemes; 4. Every task can be arranged to a particular project; 5. Possibility to send/get tasks from other users. Cons: 1. Requires premium subscription to get notifications from the app.,
"This is a great tool to keep track of task lists. I like that it is available on Android and Ubuntu. It is fast, stable and easy to use. I'm reading Atomic Habits and plan to use the tool to track all my tasks. No more google calendar or written to do lists!",
"Recurring monthly payment for no ongoing benefit. I would be happy to pay a one time premium cost for the full version, but charging a monthly payment when there's no added value, well I'm sure they're enjoying the revenue. This one's not for me, friends.",
Really loved the app. The only reason why I'm not using it full time and using the pro version is that I can't filter what tasks go to google calendar. If this is done would be great to have several calendars with different filters like for having several projects in different calendars.,
"Excellent Todo app I was looking for to replace my paper one ü•∞ simple and efficient ! It misses just 1 thing : a quick possibility when creating a new task to automaticaly recreate (or repeat) the same task every day/week/month/year. (For example i'd like to create ""pay electricity - every begining of month"") Then it's perfection !",
"No matter what other apps i try, i keep coming back to Todoist. It has the right amount of flexibility and functionality for my needs. Organizing and tagging is easy and super intuitive. Props to the Todoist team for creating an excellent app experience across all platforms!",
"Seems a good app, but can't use the basic functions without paying for premium. Eg can't have a reminder at a certain time of day without premium. Surely the basic function of a reminder app is reminders on a certain day or time. Premium is ¬£36 so expensive, loads of free alternatives out there.....",
"No ""Undo"" button. I thought this would be a basic feature on any organising app. You can't recover an accidentally deleted task/ project, etc. I accidentally created 2 of everything and had to remove them one at a time. Needs an ""Undo"" button as a basic function.",
"Starting out this app was ok, but then I started noticing how limited this is for the free version. Only 10 projects, and where did my completed tasks go? Those should not disappear until I manually delete them. A week into using this, and the workflow I was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up. These are recurring tasks I do daily. I don't know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for ""daily"", but it's lame!",
"still getting used to it.... to having goals at all really. it's one of the weapons in my new ""Grown-Up-Arsenal‚Ñ¢"". and by gawd, I can't think of a better tool to keep me on track. tons of details to (micro)manage, IF/when you need. share any part of your agenda with teammates. add links, and use natural language to set due dates. automatically update your calendar and vice-versa (grt pwr->grt rspncblty, blahblah). list mode<->storyboard mode. on and on. worth every ¬¢ for premium features too",
"After trying multiple to do list apps I found this one to best suit my needs. Its simple and effective. Unfortunately, it is rediculously buggy when syncing with google chalenders. While Todoist claims 2-way syncing, after multiple attempts my tasks kept getting deleted on Todoist and all of my chalender events on google were also deleted. I now have to waste a couple hours manually re-entering all of my google chalender events and I HOPE I don't miss an important appointment.",
"I live by lists. I've used so many apps, and nothing has the functionality of Todoist - especially for free. Slight learning curve if you want to use it to full capability, but the web site teaches you. Stop looking, you won't find better.",
"Still getting used to the UI of the app and exploring customisation. The main reason I installed this app was to set a daily routine, ways this could be easier for me is: - not having to re-type tasks everyday (not sure if there's an option for this) - having the option to keep a task crossed out/completed in the widget but also shown in the widget without disappearing (greyed/crossed out) If these features exist, that's great, how do I activate them?",
"Why do you get rid of things after making users use to it?? What happened to the press and hold to multi select? Why can't I type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like I was able to before the update. Thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones, or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same",
"I'm new to this application and so just using it for basic reminders and to do lists at the moment ... it seems simple at first, but it's full functionality (not exactly intuitive) is yet to be understood and utilized; and like most things there is a learning curve involved that must be taken into account.",
"Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick.",
"Inability to view all open-ended tasks on widget have the winning edge to one last competing app. Would also love option to check tasks as completed via checkbox to avoid two clicks. Again, as an option. Will likely reevaluate again next year in my next run of shopping apps.",
"Nice task management app...JUST cheap enough to subscribe (I do). I got it because apparently wunderlist was going down the drain, but it doesn't seem to have done...however, this works great, shared lists work nicely and it integrates well with Google Assistant. Well...it does if you go via IFTTT. The 'built in' Google Assistant Todoist interface is beyond awful, totally unusable, hence 4stars not 5. Honestly, if you use this with Google Assistant you HAVE to use IFTTT...I'm a tech guy and I make technology work for me but spending an hour trying to get 'talk to todoist' working for me was not pleasant. So frustrating...its so hard to just add a task to the project you want to add it to. It keeps thinking you're saying 'at task' not 'add task' (why would you say that when talking to a task manager?) and it can't seem to do really simple things without a 10 line conversation.  Comparing it to Wunderlist is a bit unfair since I haven't used Wunderlist for a couple of years, but compared to what I remember, this is cleaner, smoother, works better and is generally a better product. Although, if you're sticking to the free version, Wunderlist lets you do more.",
This app has come a long way in a few years. I have used a lot of task managing apps. Todoist is clean simple and it has actually replaced my whole calendar app I was using. The free version is more than good enough for everyday life managing. Highly recommend giving it a try.,
"Not super intuitive, you definitely have to spend a bit of time navigating it. Also, no function to view all to do's regardless of date; it's either ""today"" or ""future"", but you can't see entire list ranging from past due to future, which would make it easier.",
"I am very happy with this app (also the web version) and I use it daily. I really like the text parsing into project, time etc. What I would appreciate is the ability to add a place to a task and then to have a map with the tasks.",
"This is a fantastic app, and I'm thrilled to have found it. It has all the features I need. I save time every day because manipulating and updating my to do list(s) is SO fast and easy now across all my devices (PCs, Mac, and Android). Highly recommended. Many thanks to the Todoist team!",
"Two things could be improved. 1. There should be a option if I want to view the tasks organized into sub-projects in a project view. (Concerning the last update) 2. The sub-tasks could be better organized. Maybe nested inside the options, just like in Microsoft's task app.",
"Excellent app. Works without any bugs that I've found. Great way to keep on top of things. I use this for work, personal, everything. Removes stress from remembering what to do and when. I can literally throw it in the inbox and forget until my morning breakfast ""organise my day"" routine. 6 stars out of 5. Great app. üòÅüëèüëç",
"Pleasant app to use! The application is very simple and I find it very intuitive. It is quick and easy to create new tasks. Adding time and dates to task is streamlined by using the ""auto-detecting due date feature"" within the app. I am pretty new to using ""to-do""/organization apps, and I find this application as great starter and/or a great addition to tools you already use!",
"it has all the practical features that I need in order to just keep my tasks and projects organized. it is useful and user-friendly. I might go for the premium features if I see the need for them. But even without premium, it is still a very helpful application.",
"Just getting started here, less than a month in. But this app and the cross platform features make a great prosthetic executive function. A little bit of a learning curve to get even this far but the sheer power of this system rewards climbing it. I'm hooked, and transitioning to this as one of my main tools for keeping my life moving forward. No doubt I'll be bugging the community for tips soon, bit for now I am happy.",
"The main app works great but the widget has gotten worse and worse. It now has to refresh 2, 3, and sometimes 4 times when marking a task done. And because of the delay between refreshes, it often leads to accidentally marking the wrong task as done with no way go undo it.",
"Awesome, I didn't find any single downside, everything I need can be done in an elegant and effective way. And since I have installed it, I encounter more and more excellent references for Todoist in different lists, articles and courses regarding productivity and tasks management.",
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us,
"Really great app, helped me with keeping track of school work, do wish there was an events feature to keep track of up coming events amd such, there are probably other areas of improvement as well, but for a personal planner it's pretty good, would recommend to anyone else who needs a digital planner/task manager of some sort",
A place to put those end of day things that would keep you awake; to remember or reschedule; to get organised; to feel productive but less stressed: you get the picture. You know you want a to do list organiser. This one is dynamic and helpful and a pleasing UI... and i don't normally do reviews.,
"Easy way to sync google calendar with Thunderbird calendar. I was looking for a way to carry Thunderbird task list with me. Todoist allows me to sync tasks between devices. The only thing is that the Todoist tasks end up syncing with Thunderbird ""all day"" appointments, rather than showing up on the task list. The good thing is, when you log into Todoist on phone and mark tast as completed, it comes off the Thunderbird calendar.",
"It was great at first. But after the recent update, there's problem with adding new task when using it as widget. When new task is added, it will not shown unless if it was remove and added back as widget on the screen. I couldn't find any apps as best as this. Can you please fix this :(",
"I wanted to like it, but when you download it starts populating BS ""tasks"" for you. Presumably this is meant to be a tutorial, but there is no obvious way turn it off. You have to delete the routines and tasks. I downloaded this to make lists, not to spend time deleting autogenerated garbage from my notifications.",
"Been using this app for a couple of years and overall it's been solid. It's not only a life-saver but it also provides a clean minimalistic aesthetic and intuitive options throughout the ENTIRE app. High quality developments. Seems only natural to have bugs here and there, or else they'd never be able to improve the app's functionality and innovate as a result. Attentive helpful customer support team, devs, AND they provide guides,templates and very helpful tips on their site. Keep it going :)",
"Great app, intuitive interface. You can really make it work according to your needs. I love the easy recurrence setting. A small glitch that I've been getting recently is that if I've completed one or two tasks in a day, I get a popup congratulating me on completing 3. Above 3 it counts correctly. This is with productivity turned off (goals set to 0).",
"Fantastic replacement for Wunderlist! With Microsoft finally shutting down Wunderlist, I needed to find an alternative. I tried about 5 of the most recommended Todo apps and found Todoist to be the only one that truly gave me everything that I wanted. Ive been relying on this app daily for a couple weeks now and it has not let me down yet.",
"I don't like that completed tasks disappear. There's a way to show completed tasks in your inbox setting (not your daily setting) but if you want to personalize how your tasks are sorted you cannot also see your completed tasks. So for instance I'd like to see my incomplete tasks in order from soonest due date to latest, and I also want the satisfaction of seeing what tasks I've completed today. It won't let you do both at the same time though.",
"Todoist has always been one of the most useful apps for me. I have migrated to offline world recently and have decided to plan my works in my journal (instead of Todoist and GCal). However, still I needed a listing app. After a bunch of search between the apps, Todoist is still the best app I can use for making lists üòá (by the way, I should ignore some of its features like daily goals and replace the term of ""project"" with ""list"" in my mind! But it is a perfect choice for me üòä)",
"This app saved my academic career. Without it, I was neglecting my time-tracking and coursework. With it, I cleared the metaphorical bar instead of tripping over it. Its features are well-explained and easy to use or ignore at your leisure.",
"Great app, very helpful for to do lists and projects. Note to the team, I do find confirming a time for a task difficult. I can choose the time easily, but then there is no ""ok"" button or something like that.",
"nice app but the notes function at least should be free in order for this to really work for people. and it'd be a good idea to actually see the project's color when we're inside the project. other than that really good app, even made me plan stuff and i've never been much of a planner. i hate planning but it made me enjoy it, great for jotting down new ideas and stuff you wanna do whether big or small",
"Overall very good. Just a but frustrating that features such as reminders and notes are premium features. Also, moving sub-tasks about can be a bit fiddly but I understand they are working on revamping that system. Has been perfectly serviceable it spite of these things though.",
"Enjoy the app a lot, use the mobile and web version, as well as browser extension. One thing Id like to request from developers is Linux account integration. I'm pretty sure this function existed in the past and allowed to integrate Todoist with, for example, built-in Ubuntu to-do app. On the other hand, native Linux application would suffice, too. All things considered, the app offers many features one could want and subscription offers even more fine ways to tinker and tune one's experience",
"Good app. However, no means to minimize lengthy notes in the inbox. You have to scroll through the entire notes to move from one task to the next. Let there be ways to minimize / expand lengthy notes.",
"Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again ! Updates have now cleared the problem, and we're back to normal.",
"Just think of this app as your brain üß† ü§£Anything you think of put it in the inbox. This is your RAM( Random access memory ) power. No storage required, give ur brain the much needed space üôåüèΩ. Take a look at YouTube video tutorials. There are a lot of people using this app with really good setups. Definitely set this using ur computer. I believe this is the only way to link ur calendar. Gmail has the best integration.",
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!",
"I think I like this app, and have only just begun to use it since download 4 days ago. Yet I've recieved what feels like 40 emails from them. I just need a to-do list on my phone, not a community of todoist's to be part of- that's just too much to do! I got this app to help organize my life, not clutter it with emails. Edit: I was too quick to judge this app. There is a reason for is excellent reviews. It goes deep and the programming is excellent. This free software could benefit a business!",
"I used to use Evernote and had no intention of ever changing. Evernote updated their app and it was a mess. This led me to try Todoist. I didn't know what I was missing. Todoist is unbelievably easy, fast and effective in helping me manage my life and my business. Thank you, Todoist!",
"I can't believe some team can write such a beautiful app..you think and this app have that feature for you...of course you need to explore this app a bit... fantastic...I would have rated 6 stars is what my feeling is..I am a fan of this app...try plug in for outlook, sync is very fast..comment is very powerful...tags, filters, projects, smart schedule....wow!!!!",
"Good app. a lot of useful features. As a premium customer, I would like to have the ability to export to an excel or spreadsheet program for reporting purposes. Also, the app freezes a lot on Windows",
"My bad. You have to be on a Wi-Fi network that your watch recognizes in order to refresh the projects. Still, I would like for Bluetooth to suffice. Otherwise great concept. Good way to organize tasks. I have yet to unleash the full potential of this, without paying, for now.",
"My favorite to-do app out of the insane plethora of to-do apps. I tried a lot but this one stuck with me the most. The key for me was how simple it is but powerful at the same time. A quick ""Water plants every other Saturday p3 #House"" correctly identifies the list it belongs to, sets up the frequency and marks its priority. This app seriously puts me in control of my day so nothing ""slips"" my mind any more. I have recommended it to my boss and he also loves it.",
"very disappointed after i got premium, i was hoping to be able to set goals on a weekly schedule planner but none of that. instead, it keeps tracks on how many tasks i completed overall. but who cares about that? it isn't gonna help me at all. the fact that there isn't any trial to see if we like it or not and we have to pay just to regret it is disappointing.",
"Useful, though there is a learning curve. Getting tasks to nest properly under a single larger task can be fiddly. A lot of features are only available for pay, which is fair. The free version serves its purpose (i.e. keeping track of large numbers of small tasks across multiple devices).",
"Came highly recommended. Tried it. HATE that I can't see the subtasks in a project(why even..), and apparently that's a recent update! Well no one seems to like this feature, or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not, so hope you guys bring it back. Will use it then. Another observation- most of the top-notch features are unavailable to non-Premium users, and not many are willing to subscribe. Seems a bit unfair. One time payment would be great. Will that change?",
"Best Project/Productivity App: The premium version of the app has been well worth the $. I have ADHD and struggle with being overwhelmed by the amount of things that need to be done. This app is becoming my ""second brain"" where I can throw everything in, organize it in a way that makes sense to me, and if I only want to look at what I need to accomplish that day I just look at ""Today"". The ability to create sub tasks for my sub tasks is what I've been looking for in other apps but couldn't find",
"After almost two months, I'm hooked. I can't believe I haven't found this app till now, really helping me get over my hare-brained organization skills. One tip is to start small. 6 tasks per day should be easy, with each task not taking more than an hour. I've now built up to 10 tasks per day and usually accomplish 8. Here's to progress!",
"Amazing app, been using it to manage most of my routines. The auto date recognition is superb, though for some reason they don't give you the ability to view a particular day's completed task, it's not much but I kinda missed that satisfactory feeling that I get when I tick off tasks in Any.do.",
"Since the latest update, the widget I use to check Today's tasks does not update the tasks from one day to another. It's a quite annoying bug, and I can manually force the update by switching to ""Upcoming"" then back to today. Please fix it and I'll gove it 5 stars, this is quite a good app if it wasn't for this issue, which affects how I mainly use it.",
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.,
"I've been using this app and the GTD method to stay focused and organized. My life is pretty crazy. I have 4 young kids, a husband, a house, parents who live with us; I'm a full-time student and a part-time massage therapist. I've also started grant writing on the side. I love being able organize my tasks lists and calendar in one app! I could not have completed a 19-credit course load plus the rest of my life responsibilities without Todoist!",
"After almost a month of daily use, I love it so far! Especially in widget form where I can add tasks, reschedule, edit, etc right there on the homescreen without having to go to the app itself all the time. The added themes/customizability is an added plus as well.",
I'm paying for this and just discovered 41 tracking events in the past 5 minutes. No thanks; I'll pay someone else.,
"Perfect app to help you organize your day and goals. I'll take some time to look at the premium features because there's a whole lot! Sad that all the in-app links with useful info always redirect you to the main page, forcing you to search for them manually.",
"Amazing app. I'm using Pro plan, since I have many projects with different tasks. The app became very handy when developers added board view. The only thing for me missing is a notepad. I would love to have a notepad in the app, so I can make some notes withing my project in overall. Let's say, a wider version of comments feature. Thank you!",
"Initially I was really impressed, and I like the app, but there seems to be one big problem... The search feature. It does not search comments at all. I use comments to keep detailed information of the task, without being able to search and find information in the comments it severely limits the functionality of the app. I was hoping filter would work, but it does not either. That pretty much eliminates the functionality for me.",
Simple and comfortable design. I think a calendar section can be handy (I use 'Upcoming' but it's not so intuitive) and also when scheduling: It's prefer to choose day+hour at the same session- in Todoist it's seperate. But overall it's great.,
"I like it. Wish I could change and reorder events on the widget. Also while typing out bullet reminders for my next projecr, a burst of inspiration came over me and I typed for a while in the subcategories to later organize in word or docs. When scrolling down, I realized multiple paragraphs disappeared with no way to get them back. Wish it auto saved AND added a link or page for typing like converting to word or Google docs if the note reminder winds up being an essay report.",
"Great for setting my to-do list and managing a team. Definitely makes it easier for me to keep pace with all the things I have to do and ensure that everyone on my team is clear on their responsibilities. Would be great to be able to name a manager for each project so that the owner executes, but the manager can know what to follow up on. Also, a reassign feature would be helpful for when a task owner plans to be out of office for any reason.",
"Remains very useful. Only minor irritation is icons for premium features are visible, so occasionally click on them to be told they are not available, leading me to shout at the machine. Also if a task shows as overdue because I forgot to mark it done, I would like to be able to mark it completed yesterday",
"One of the best apps I use. Less buggy than Facebook. They think of useful features, like having a button that takes me into the app after adding a task in the home screen widget. Shows that features are well-thought out. It's the little things üôÇ",
"I've been using this app paid version for years. I use it to manage projects, employees, work task, personal tasks, grocery lists, etc. It's amazing. You owe it to yourself to at least try the free version. My only suggestion would be to add some sort of easy integration to add emails or copy/pastes to a to do item.",
"Constantly buggy. I've used this app for five years, and they are always pushing bad releases. Right now there is a crash expanding lists, which would have been found with some quick testing. Several years ago I filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists. Every few months I check in and out still isn't fixed. The web app is not letting you expand sections. The windows app was scrambling the order for months. They must do zero quality control.",
"Excellent app, takes a little bit to understand all you can do with it but once you do, even without premium it is fantastic. I use the widget to organize everything i want to do and having it has been a huge help in increasing my focus and productivity.",
"Recent major update has strongly impeded on usability of app. I understand and appreciate the focus on subtasks and some other features, however I think the developers have severely misjudged the actual most common user stories. Was always a big fan, paid subscriber for many years, but this update was a major letdown. Unnecessary changes for something that was working almost perfectly.",
"Not all tasks reach completion, some need to be deleted and rightly so. But by design delete action is tucked away under three dots menu and then behind confirmation message. Thus making deleting tasks in bulk deliberately harder, probably to keep fake karma number high and jack up usage statistics.The swipe action on the list should be customisable so delete action can be set when its swipe left. Also since recent updates the upgrade to premium nudge is slapped everywhere.",
"A perfect, simplistic GTD tool that works across all platforms including wear watches. Has just enough features on the free version, that is very much appreciated. I'd be happy to upgrade to the paid version if I need the advanced features.",
"The app is good and user interface is simple. The thing is in free version, the projects are limited to 5 and you cant add descriptions to tasks! Tick tick give 9 projects and can add description even to sub-tasks! Would be nice if we have a merged version between them :"")",
"Need an option to default show the completed tasks. And a Kanban like board view.. like trello with thumbnail support. Overall it's a very good app.. and I have got 1 year Premium.. The best part for me is the notification and reminder syncing across all my devices. All mobiles, laptops and desktops.",
"With my ADHD, this app is a godsend. I use it for a multitude of tasks and it almost certainly makes me better at following through. Lists are handy but Todoist takes it to the next level. Five stars are definitely earned. For me, it's worth the few dollars/month to go premium, but even without all the additional features this app is a must-have for anyone who is in need of that extra mental shelf-space.",
"Great personal and project mangement app. Allows me to see the big picture and smaller supporting steps in an intuitive way, helping me to easily break down overwhelming intersecting projects and plug them in my schedule. Simple and straightforward, easy to use, no glitches.",
"Works as described. Few things I think would improve... Screen widget: Don't delete without confirmation. Plus sign to expand task to show comments. More customization of appearance (individual colors for background, text, etc. not just the included fixed selections)(background transparency).",
Android syncing does not work,
"I use this app everyday and upgraded to a subscription plan. The UI is pleasent enough especially with dark mode. I appreciate how modular the app is: you assign tasks for the day, have them repeat on specific days, assign tasks to projects, and add subtasks. This app has enhanced my productivity. My only complaint is that repeating subtasks don't visually disappear after having been completed that day. I do hope the developers make repeating subtasks behave identically to their parent tasks.",
"Awesome! Was using Wunderlist, but they are going away. I tried a few others. They are all so similar now. But this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads. Also, it is as simple as Wunderlist. I did have to pay $29 and Waunderlist was free for the most important functions, so that was different. But after using the app for a week I'm sold. Not a better app out there for my purposes. KISS- keep it simple stupid. And this app does that.",
"Of all the apps I had like google calendar, tasks and other stuff, this has stood out of all. It's easy, fast and simple. Also, the UI is what appeals me the most and the widget is quite a good feature since I can quickly look at my whole week just by swiping the list from widget. Overall the best in its category.",
"This app optimized my college workflow. Having separate categorized lists for each subject is great. Previously I was using an app that only let you make a check list, this lets you have separate checklists for each category. So for example in my stats class I have separate dated check lists with homework, readings, and reminders. Great stuff!",
"On the widget, you should have make it able to open the app when we click the task (make us easier to do the editing). And also when input new task, I prefer it was put on top instead of below so we can keep track to avoid double input. But so far still ok. Thanks.",
"This is without a doubt one of the best apps I have. It took me a year (2016/17) switching one productivity app to another.. google keep, evernote and google calendar all to keep my tasks and reminders the way I need em. This blessed app gave me all these in one, and a lot more. It helped me get weekly status reasults, boosts and karma, labels, prioritizing feature, Filters, the awesome widget on home screen... i just love it. Funny there're still features i havent digged yet",
"I've been using todoist for almost 6 months every day, it's perfect for my ADHD addled brain. With Todoist I can manage day to day little things without being bogged down by an over-complicated UI. My work has improved, my habits have improved, and my girlfriend no longer gets annoyed because I forget to do the dishes 30 times.",
This has saved me from myself! I feel like I am always so disorganized I can never find my tasks or set a schedule. Being able to write it all in one placeü•≥ is phenomenal and having it auto organize based on various things has been a life saver. my ADHD brain will never be able to live without this app!,
"Amazing organization. It helps me a lot organising my day. I used google Calendar earlier but didn't find it very friendly (no offence). However, this app really helped me a ton. One star less because i have a feedback to share, which i feel.is a downside. Some tasks might span over days, say from Monday to wednesday but this app only takes specific days. It would be nice to have an option to let it spread over days.",
"Todoist is extremely helpful with my productivity; its layout is intuitive and it's organized very well. It has a minimalistic design while still having many features that other apps do not have, given that I've tried many agenda setting/to do list apps, and this has worked the best for me.",
"Nice app. Does the job it claims to do really well through a simple, intuitive, and easy to learn UI. Also, does not overwhelm with ads. They are placed well and do not continually interfere with app usage.",
"Best to do list app I've used. Super seamless and easy to learn without forcing you to learn their paradigm. Lots of features available to organize, but you don't have to use them if you don't want to. Highly recommend, especially as a UX Designer and Researcher. Very flexible and so quick to get started.",
"I tried the free version. I liked the way, that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself, but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus. I prefer to use Google task app, that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task.",
"I have a tendency to be a scattered, distracted worker. This has helped me focus, plan, and write down things when they occur to me (instead of spending energy trying to remember). This also utilizes my phone being on me all the time as a strength in productivity instead of a hindrance.",
"The app has helped me alot be more productive, the interface is good and everything works nicely. To todoist team I would love a functionality to track my habits, i.e. the tasks I repeat on daily basis, currently I use another app for that(habits loop). Cause adding a repetitive tasks daily becomes tedious. So if that can be added to it'd be just awesome. Anyways keep up the good work. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",
"Incredibly intuitive to how I think and is even better than how I would've designed such a product. Looking forward to enjoying additional features this company incorporates into the app as I can already see from existing features that they make smart business and technological decisions. Would love a calendar view, but I understand that it's not really a calendar app. Would love to be able to make entire ""sections"" recurring and remove character limitations. Keep up the good work! üëçüèª",
"Free version does everything I want - handy reminder list, easy to move tasks around, smart recurring tasks, clear way to organize home, work and other tasks, smooth transition between mobile and desktop versions. Switched from my old task organizer to Todoist a few months ago and have never regretted the switch!",
"Love Todoist! I love that I can remove all the clutter of my projects from my head and put them in the app organized. Besides normal ""to-do"" like paying Bill's, or dog to the vet, it helps me organize hobby projects, automobile maintenance, shopping lists, projects at work, and even listing fun things to do around town (like a bucket list). I haven't used some of the advanced features yet.",
I've been using Todoist for many years now dor both professional and private tasks. I paid early on for the full version and it's worth buying it eg. to set reminders and for many other important features. I have no idea what else could I use as effectively as this app for this crazy problem of managing my tasks all around... Good job guys! Thx!,
"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",
"Used Todoist years ago, then went on to MS TO-DO. Couldn't get To Do to sync with Calendar. went back to Todoist and realised how awesome it is. Simple, professional, smooth, efficient. It syncs with everything and the Ul is just perfect! Seriously, I've tried them all, Asana, Trello, ToDo, etc. Todoist is the 'sticker'",
"Very good at helping me stay organized. I would like the ability to make expiration dates for tasks so if i don't do them by a certain point they disappear, but that's really the only ""missing"" feature that i'd want and use.",
"Life changing. Worth the subscription price. I have tried many task apps. Love the sub tasks, labels vs projects, sharing, app integrations, color coding, repeating task options, due dates and clean anesthetics. The ability to enter due dates in abbreviated natural language is so time saving. Encouragements for completing tasks also cute and fun.",
"Todoist is great, no questions about it. Well built, nicely designed, regularly updated. I've been a premium user since Wunderlist was on the chopping block. However, I realized I'm paying $36 each year for essentially one feature: task reminders. Additionally, 2 users in 1 household on 1 budget pay 100% more for both to use the app. I think that's ridiculous so I'm out.",
"I love this app, but would it be possible to Sort the tasks in the widget according to the already set preferences? It's quite irritating to add a task from the widget which has higher priority than those on the list, only to see it added at the bottom of the list (off screen), thus obliging me to then open app, choose Sort, and manually reorder tasks (with same preference, Priority) so that the new task will go straight to the top of the list on the widget. The widget should automatically sort newly added items according to established preferences. Thanks!",
"Great app, but needs to be able to switch accounts easily. I have an account for personal life, and work life. On my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist.",
Easily the best app I have EVER installed. I pay for Premium and I probably will for the rest of my life but it is beyond worth it. I recommend this app to everyone I meet that I think could benefit from knowing about it. I love the new features that have been added such as sub-tasks and the organization tools and predictive tagging make this app 10x better than even it's closest competitor. No other to do list app can even hold a candle to this one.,
"I needed a To do app, after trying 5 or 6 this is by far the best. I have it installed on 5 phones within my family now as well as pc's and Mac's to make sure tasks that were forever being forgotten are no longer left behind. The only drawback I have found so far is that you cannot set a reoccurring event. There are many tasks that I do for work or home that happen weekly, monthly or annually. I can go through and add events in the future but this would be a huge task. Am I missing something?",
"I'd like it except the widget is the most important feature for me. It displayed my inbox for about a week and now comes up blank. The tasks are there tho. I can read them if I open them, or open the app. :-( You're not the only organizer with this problem tho. Android 9.",
"It lets you takes notes provided you've payed for premium. In any case, it's one of the best apps I've tried: it lets you stay productive, doesn't have other things that would affect your overall focus by spending too much time doing things within the app, and creating tasks couldn't be easier.",
"Todoist is absolutely amazing and completely love it after switching off Wunderlist once Microsoft started breaking it and completely love it, which is amazong since I liked Wunderlist so much (I stopped once Microsoft started breaking it). The only complaint I have is that the annual cost for getting all of the features is a little high so my liking, hence the 4 stars. Make it a little lower or male it REALLY worth the $$ and it'll easily jump to 5.",
"Edit to my original review: this issue has been fixed very quickly by the devs! Working beautifully again and extremely happy with the speed of their work. Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days. Edit: I have emailed details of the bug to support.",
"Update: notifications have returned. I would go back to 5 stars but my four day interaction with customer service was disappointing, including telling me there would be no prorated refund for loss of service. >>I've been communicating with cust service and every time they say ""try this we think it's fixed"" it isn't. SUPER disappointing, unfortunately will be canceling my annual premium subscription if not fixed today.",
"Easy way to organize myself and my family. I'm looking forward to continued use. I'm currently using the free version, so I can't rate the full version. There is enough usability with the free version for personal use. I assume the enhanced features would be beneficial for project planning with a team.",
"I particularly like how it transforms normal sentences into scheduled items, such as, ""Clean the washer filter every two months starting this Friday"". I upgraded to Premium after using this for a couple of years, because a few of the remaining features (like Notes) seemed useful, and the app developers had earned to right to some of my money, as I saw it.",
"I've used the app for a few weeks now and I'm very impressed! Usually calendar organization and planning is a drag for me, but this app has made it so much easier, even on the free version. I just wish I could see a full calendar of the month with tasks/colors.",
"at first just a couple things needed to get used too but this app has seriously saved me mentally- I get very overwhelmed even when theres not much to do so being able to write it all down and tick things off is very helpful and is helping me destress!!! i seriously recommend this to anyone who has similar anxiety/depressive feelings of being overwhelmed no matter the task, and/or executive dysfunction... its really helped me.",
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.",
"Life changing! Very much needed for 2021! If I could give this app more than the limited 5 stars, I would. Beautiful interface. It didn't take me too long to get a hang of it as well. So much more more organised than the other planner apps I have come across :)",
"TODoist is a FANTASTIC app! It is one of the better apps that I have worked with in business, yet to be honest I first stumbled upon it by looking for a timer app that would interact / syncronize with Trello. It was then that I read that ToDoist DOES sync with many other apps, and that if I were using Pomodone (a pomodoro timer app), then all that I do in ToDoist would be readily synced into Pomodone, allowing me to not only schedule and prioritize my time but ALSO to discipline myself to accomplish it through timers. If you are using ToDoist than Pomodone seems like it was built purely to enable your productivity goals in ToDoist! Together, these apps are unbeatable! Having said all of this, ToDoist is alone ABSOLUTELY worth the time and money to learn and to purchase! I have used MANY different scheduling or GTD systems, and ToDoist is far and away the best that I have used! Do yourself a great favor and learn the keyboard shortcuts!! These are very powerful in action. The app‚Äôs ability to understand common language / phrasing is simply uncanny! REALLY WELL DONE!!! I highly recommend ToDoist. I mysefl committed to changing the system that I was already using, (largely because of the tie-in between ToDoist and Trello and Pomodone), and I can certify that it was WELL worth my investment of time!",
I like this app because it erases things that you checked off when you click the circle. There are other to do lists that do not do this and you have to go to multiple screens to delete what you did. Very easy to use and a very happy,
"As I've gotten older, those ""Oh, I must remember to xyz"" thoughts get forgotten more readily. Short term memory isn't what it was. With Todoist, I can schedule, verbally, by Alexa, or by simply typing, any reminder. Such as ""take garbage out every Thursday at 7am"", ""change bank passwords every 2 months"". Todoist software is a great add-on to my life because it supplements my normal productivity engine. My productivity has always been a sense of pride. Todoist let's it continue to be so.",
"I was using Todoist for more than 3 years now. Mostly free version, since its enough for me to track my tasks. Todoist is very intuitive and easy to use productivity tool. it helped me a lot, backing up my memory and reminding me of important actions. 5 out of 5. Thank you for a great app and service!",
"This is a great app. It can be as simple or complicated as you want. Upgrading gives you access to labels which can help with context and filtering. Depending on how you organize, this can be a big help, but the app works great even without upgrading.",
Its a very good tool for keeping on track but I have adhd and its difficult for me to use sometimes since It doesn't include reminders or alarms unless you pay which I can't do. Overall its a very good app and can be used on desktop too but I would like if it was free to get reminders,
"Coming from Wunderlist, this is the best one I found. There is one thing which I find irritating. The added item goes to the bottom of the list. Can you add an option to sort by reverse date? That would make it perfect list for me.",
"It's a great app with a bug that occasionally unmoves the task you just tried to reorganize the order of. It's frustrating to have a full day of tasks, try to put them in the order they belong in, and have each one undo itself and need placing twice.",
"Largely a good app. The beat To Do app I've found. -1 Star because the app has started to put out a ""Turn on location reminders"" notification, and there is no way to disable that (I can't even find the setting, even if I did intend to turn it on, which I don't).",
"Can no longer set reminders without upgrading to pro version. Defeats the purpose of the app. This was a great app, very easy to use and the widget was so much better than other similar apps. But they just had to ruin it. I'm uninstalling.",
I love thus App! We use it as a team at work and it helps us get things done! We dont forget projects plus we can see who has completed what and it does 85% of everthing I want it to do and it does it well. The two things I hope they add is the ability to wtite notes and have monthy views with out the need of your calander. If they do that it would do everthing that I want 100% of the ways I wouf like to use it. That would bring my rating up to 5 stars,
Todoist is by far the greatest app I have ever used. It runs my entire life and I can't imagine parting from it ever. I have probably used every major productivity app across every platform and I always come back to this one. The flexibility and feature set it provides is completely unmatched by anything else.,
"To doist is wonderful app but it lacks one major thing, that... we can not insert a new bullet or line in btwn lines. Dynalist has this feature. If todoist implements this feature it will be lot beneficial for end users. for now new task always goes bottom of the last task n then we have to move it and reallign or readjust the sequence.",
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.",
"Todoist has truly changed my life! I am far more purposeful and productive from using it and the sense of achievement and fulfillment from this is great. I use the projects function to organise all of my work tasks (I'm a primary teacher) but I also make sure to schedule time to spend on hobbies, skills, interests and personal goals, and I'm making far more progress on all of that than I ever was previously. I'm pretty much hooked for life now, Todoist! üòÅ",
"I was really surprised at how effective this app is. As a incurable procrastinator I had little hopes this app would have any positive impact on my persistent lack of motivation to do anything. But it worked! I load the app with things I need to do at the start of the day and by the end I have done them all. I often add items to my list throughout the day and manage to get them done too. This may not sound like much , but to me it's been a miracle.",
"I've gone through many To Do lists apps and this has been my favorite for over a year. If you haven't given this a try then you are doing yourself a disservice. Clean, night mode, not glitchy, and the free version is 5/5.",
"Might be slow in adding more features compared to other apps, but I think, it's because of their focus on the app's reliability - which is very much evident. Long time user, tried other apps, but I keep coming back to todoist with how useful and functional it is. It's worth trying and keeping.",
"I really enjoy todoist. I have to compartmentalize my task lists and being able to create separate projects, sections, and add labels helps keep me organized. Having the functionality to add reminders, comments, share, and put priorities on tasks further makes this a useful app.",
"I reviewed the software to provide 80 projects in free version and collaborators. On installing the product today, it has reduced the projects and collaborators all of a sudden. I was so confused looking at the pricing page show different things all of a sudden to understand there has been an update. Though the app is good, but it's targeted towards premium users more than the basic users. Wouldn't serve the purpose. I guess I would have to program my own to get pretty basic features in an app!",
"The problem with most todo apps is they overcomplicate it, making it hard to use. This app excels at being simple to just add a task but also contains the power to be truly customizable. The app has saved me multiple times. Worth the subscription.",
"It's a great app. Thank you. I wish it would let me to write time and cost of each task I list, so I could calculate how much I need to invest, also it would be nice if I could organize my tasks based on priority and change their priorities if necessary.",
"App is great, one thing I would love is a calendar view of a whole month with tasks. It could be really helpful at planning. And maybe some sort of a habit tracker where you can see when you completed your habits and when you failed to do so :]",
"So far, really great app. Keeps everything organized and not overwhelming. I love how it is available on multiple platforms as well. Great productivity tool. I wish I didn't have to pay a subscription for extra features. I'd like a one-time purchase for the full version.",
"So i dont understand, I just installed this app *on my phone*, so why do I need to ""continue"" with an email account, Google, or Facebook? Can't I just open the app and check things out to see how it works without ""signing up"" for something? Update: Okay, everything is stored in the cloud. Well I guess this App isn't for me then, since I want my data stored on my local device. But that is really too bad as it sounded like an interesting app. (I don't want to use a fake email address).",
"I've been a dedicated ""To do list"" user for decades and Todoist is literally the online app of my dreams. I've tried several and all had shortcomings. From desired features to seamless integration across multiple platforms, Todoiest has it all and does it all. I'm loving it! If you use To Do lists daily I highly recommend Todoist.",
"After starting to use todoist I've seen subtle, yet real improvement to my life. Some productivity boost, but the biggest betterment is in my mental state. With a solid service like this I feel secure and confident knowing that I can outsource remembering my responsibilities and deadlines, and know that I will get to all tasks I enter because it just works that well. Todoist also has an open API, so I set up a script to email me the most important tasks of the day every morning üëå. Bonus points",
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium",
"This app can potentially change your life, and that's not hyperbole! It's intuitive to use and seemlessly updates your data across devices. I'm deducting a ‚≠ê because it has a paid subscription rather than a one-time payment.",
"I use this app everyday for work and home. It really helps keep me organized and keeps me working to priorities. Todoist continues to make usability improvements that add icing to the cake. I have a paid subscription...as a bit of a miser, that pretty much tells what I think of it. Thumbs up.",
"Great tool for implementing the ""Getting Things Done"" methodology. The sub-subtasks under subtasks, options to label, and add due date to each task (including subtasks) are excellent features that are present in TODOIST. It's integration with Google Calendar is again amazing that help you to remember and review all your tasks at same place. I recommend this app to users who intend to efficiently multitask.",
"This looked promising, but I literally had no welcome or intro to using this app whatsoever, and it came across to me as too fiddly and time consuming to work it all out. Honestly, sometimes it's best to keep things simple - writing lists and goals shouldn't be made this complicated. I've uninstalled and found a more basic app, this 1 isn't for me.",
"It's good, but everytime I mark a task as completed on the widget I have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again. You guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime. Cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way I dislike constantly.",
"Great app but need a calendar & a timer to make it complete. Im a visual person and I love time blocking so long lists overwhelm me, for todoist to shine at the top you guys need to implement a calendar and then a timer at some point. Visually and speed of entry are outstanding but need just those to make it complete.",
"I once rated this app and company a five star. However long, with their recent updates they have utterly failed to test the user experience. All the alerts.settings are changed so you get texts, notifications and emails when you had turn them off. The suggested time zone change so their app ""will.function correctly"" breaks the assigned due date times. I like to see companies trying to improve, but if they are this lazy with the user experience who lazy are they with customer data. Lost of all trust here.",
"The widget, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app, doesn't seem to be updating anymore, even when I click the refresh button. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed.",
"it's a great getting things done app, can be simple to use, can be very functional. Cross platoform and just nice to use. 4 starts are because the premium which unlocks features that calendar has, costs ¬£36 a year, which i think is too much for what it's offerring.",
I got tired of keeping paper lists of things I had to accomplish & having to write the uncompleted ones over & over. Then the irritation of carrying the list & keeping track of where I put it. Now I carry the list on my Todoist & enjoy marking them off but reminding me what I need to work on. Great tool!,
"Giving Todoist a 2-star review because the sync issues are so frequent that it makes the app a pain to use. Real shame because the interface is really sleek and there are some great features. Sync issues I've encountered: - I try to add a task and it doesn't actually add because it didn't sync for some reason - I try to add a task using the laptop app and it doesn't add because sync issue - I try to move a task up in the list and it doesn't work, goes back to initial position",
"Organized, takes a slight bit of getting used to, but highly recommended. Have gotten several people into using it & is effective to the degree that I may push for my company to embrace its use as well. DEVS: Can we get a slightly different visual indicator for the ""Today"" & ""Inbox"" screens? I often edit my own tasks & those I have collab'd on, & often catch myself forgetting what screen I'm in. Colored bar down one side, slightly tinted background to match project color, etc. KEEP IT UP! :)",
"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.",
"Essential to my sanity. I can sync to-dos with my calendars and send tasks from my email (with attachments) to my to-do list. This app is the one thing keeping me sane and somewhat looking like I'm on top of things. Well, mostly sane anyway.",
So far has been a great replacement form Apples Reminders. I always used Reminders app to sync all my tasks between phone table and computers and switching to Android I was worried. But this has worked perfect. Even better. It syncs with everything and has a nice and clean organized interface. I'm digging it.,
"The only way this would be better is if there were a built-in calendar and notifications for items with a time deadline. But overall I love the app, especially the seamless syncing between desktop and mobile apps.",
"If you want to track tasks via a todo list interface, this is the app for you. Having an inbox to dump stuff into is a god send, allowing me to focus on what needs doing today by getting everything else out of my head for processing at a later time. Highly recommended.",
"This has to be the best free app there is. It is thoroughly AMAZING and it does everything I need it to do. I love recording the things I need to do--getting them out of my head and into the app gives me so much peace of mind. I use it to organize and schedule all kinds of tasks, both personal and professional. Highly recommended!",
"I had been happily using Todoist for over a year until it started sending me junk notifications (an attempt to get you to open the app) on days I didn't have any tasks scheduled, it wasn't possible to disable these without disabling the notifications for my actual tasks as they had them under the same notification category. This rendered the app useless to me so I've uninstalled it, nice work team.",
"Easily one of the most useful tools I've discovered in my lifetime. For me, the cross platform functionality and simple UI just works. I also love the brand and the company, and how they support remote work and promote design philosophy.",
I made the switch from post-it notes to this app to be more environmentally responsible maybe 2 years ago and haven't looked back. Great free app that has all the basics and then some necessary for keeping things in check. Highly recommend.,
"Very intuitive and easy to use. The scheduling and recurrence features are great for setting up daily drumming practice sessions, as well as getting other life stuff done. Karma points are an added bonus that help keep me motivated.",
Your reminder system could use some improvements please. If we could just click the clock and a watch would pop up where we just input the time or you suggest intervals of 30 min or 1 hour. At the moment we have to type out the time and it's not efficient. I use the app for my sales team 8 hours a day. Please do something about this.,
Editing (changing) the timing and frequency of recurring events is infuriating enough for me to give it only one star. This should be one of the most fundamental and easiest things to do in an app that bills itself as a top notch time management/ PM tool.,
Lovely App. A perfect app. I had gone through a lot of apps but this one is just awesome. I am using it and it's very useful. Very simple and I like the way it reminds of pending uncompleted tasks via phone and e mails. It's a very important tool for me on daily basis. Bravo to the developers of this app.,
"I have lived by Todoist for the last four years. I love tgat it syncs with my Google calendar and how easy it is to set recurring items and reschedule. My only complaint is that i have to go to my Google calendar to look more than 7 days out. I havent tried any other to-do list apps, but ive been quite pleased with this one!",
"This app is easy to use and has good options to schedule and organize tasks. I got it because it was recommended by Tim Challies in his book Do More Better (a Christian book on productivity). Adding, scheduling, and organizing tasks is easy with this app. The trick is to consistently do the tasks that you add to the app!",
"Todoist is the best. I've been trying to change to other apps, buy todoist is easy to use, has many options to manage tasks and projects. It has also nice and clean UI. Creating tasks by natural language is really making it fast to create task.",
"2/11/23 - Recent update doubles down on gamifying the app. I had to delete my goals to keep from getting daily and weekly pop-ups when reaching them. There should be an option to stop these pop ups for the people who don't want a full-screen celebration everytime they do their normal day-to-day functions. Not everyone wants a cheering section all the time. Glad it's here for those who do, but I want to be able to turn it off.",
"Really useful app, i like that i can set repeating reminders. It would be nice to be able to do something like ""lunch prep sunday-thursday"" and have that repeat, rather than ""lunch prep every sunday"" ""lunch prep every monday"", but it's a small thing. I'd also like reminders, but that's a premium thing and they have to make money somehow so oh well. overall i do love this app!",
Love everything about the app except the new swipe animations are awful. I swipe right to complete and the task used to just completely swipe off the screen but now it bounces back and just fades away. It makes me feel like I didn't swipe correctly every time.,
"Great app!!! After I used almost all the apps for tasks and events. The enhancements almost every week/month üëè üëç üëå The support team is excellent, well knowledge and contribution. I have more than a year with the premium version; I won't think to go to another app.",
"Mainly using it because it integrates with spark email app but the chrome extension is great and features like filters, labels, and search are pretty good but can be better. No task descriptions which is weird but task comments make it work. Overall pretty good.",
I have nothing but good things to say about this app. A few months ago I started using the desktop version and it's helped my productivity a ton. I'm a former sticky note addict and todoist has been the cure lol This app is entirely what you make it though. Put in some effort with creating tasks and it'll pay off with time saved later on!,
"App is very easy to use, with a simple guide when you first download it! Only used it for one day so far, but found the organising quite efficient and helped me to streamline my brain quite easily without the mess of pen and paper! Very happy so far!",
buy the premium version! i have tried many apps for my gtd. but this is the one that works. its got an easy UI so you can add and edit tasks without going into different screens. you can priortize itsms which i find very useful as it shows you what is your primary focus,
Great app for managing my ever growing to do list. There is the option to add tags to separate between work and personal projects. There is also a great feature that allows you to rapidly prioritise tasks by typing p1 p2 p3. Would recommend.,
Great little app that does exactly what you want it to and more! Helps in my job to self-manage and organise tasks as well as setting individual goals for myself. Even started using it as reminders for things at home! Very handy and super useful,
"This app is a great to do list app, and it makes a great homework planner. I use this with the board view at school and it is awesome. I have a school Chromebook and the PWA is top-notch, and the Android app is great at sending notifications for homework assignments. Also, the widgets are great and the free plan. 10/10 experience!",
I love this app as a simple way to keep me on track and help me plan out what needs to be done. I only wish that i could configure it to a modified day structure. Since i work 3rd shift i stay up all night and once it goes past 12 it complains that i missed a task. When in fact I'm just barely halfway through the day.,
"Bought a premium as a gift to my friend on 21 Dec, had soon many issues with getting this pro to her account!!! At the end, my money was reimbursed and her pro cancelled. With a second try they gave us a link to pay, but their price was 25% higher than initial price (we were trying to arrange annual subscription). Bitterly disappointed with their service. Was left without pro. Thankfully, got my money back. But they have spoiled mood completely.",
The free app works but is too basic. Upgrading to the full features (with little detail on what these are) costs $30 PER YEAR. Insane pricing for a to do list. Only a complete budgetary idiot would load up on app subscriptions that steep.,
Awesome app. Would give 5 stars if: Capability to add lists outside of Inbox for items that are processed and organized within my contexts (I use labels for these). That way inbox is just for new to-dos fresh out of my head with no processing only. Using projects for this is a work around.,
Thank you so much for this app. This app helps me so much in doing my everyday tasks because I'm so forgetful about what I should do the next day and this app is so easy to add task that I don't feel complicated when I need to add a task quickly. The home widget button is also pretty and easy to use still. Doing daily/weekly/monthly task is so easy. The shortcuts really helped me.,
I cannot live without this app! It's the first and only list making app I have been able to actually use and ditch paper. It is rich in easy to use features and I love that it syncs everywhere. Super well done and never any glitches.,
"Great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw. Every time I create a task, it goes to the bottom of the list. I always want the task at the top so I can see it. That's the whole point of using a to do list. So I have to drag the task, one by one to the top. Makes me crazy.",
"I like using the app, but unfortunately it crashes every time i reschedule large amount of tasks at the same time. (I had 170 tasks yesterday and i did only 70. Today i woke up and rescheduled the 100 from yesterday and it crashes) There's no such issue when i do it through the web version.",
"This app is so clunky to use and the premium fees would be a complete ripoff. So bad I tried another by Pocket Brilliance. Huge improvement, even w the free version and paid is more reasonable. Steer clear of this one, just a ploy to force you to upgrade to premium. Free version doesnt even let u see completed tasks older than a week. Just one example of many where they fall short here or try to force premium sales.",
"I have found this app very helpful for keeping track of deadlines in university and staying on top of responsibilities outside of school. I would suggest adding the option to configure what time the day resets. For example, I like to write out tasks for the next day before I go to bed, which may be after 12 am. Adding this feature would prevent accidentally schdeduling tasks a day later than intended.",
Conatant sync problems. Throwing errors when trying to view activity log. Not all actions of collaborators are logged. For example collaborator completed a task and it doesn't show in notifications. But sometimes it does. All in all very unpredictable app.,
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.,
In the last few weeks I can't see any of the font unless I put in dark mode. If I click on the name of the item it just pops up and disappears right away. I didn't see any updates but not sure what changed it's not very useful anymore. Issue resolved.,
"I'm impressed by the clean interface and straightforward approach - it has exactly the features you need for TODOs without bloat, complication, or distraction. The price point also works for me ($3/mo if purchased annually; no additional charge for my wife to access my projects on her device).",
"After using this product for a month on the computer and my phone, I have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with. The free option isn't as good as other options such as Microsoft To Do and the paid solution offers little more than these either.",
"I didn't get even the access to add lables and reminder which done for free by many others. I look forward for doist to include at least lables and reminders with the free plan. I really loved but without the mentioned features in the free plan, I don't want to make it my to do list app.",
prevuously I would have given this app 1000 stars... I love this app but it just updated and now the widget isn't functional.. I've been using this app for years and never had a problem.. I'm very sad about this.. This app has been so beneficial to me and having the widget made my life easier and was a good reminder that I had stuff to do.. now I have to rewire my brain to actually open the app instead of just seeing it on my home screen... Also the view all isn't working for me.. ‚òπÔ∏èü´§,
"Todoist is the cornerstone of my organizational system. I am an undergraduate student and use this app to manage my reading assignments, exam schedule, administrative deadlines etc. sync with windows 10 desktop app is awesome. I am a free user and would gladly pay a one time price for full features here but a monthly subscription is a turn off.",
Great app. Use it basically every day. Would love if there was a way to 'select all' items on your list when your on your phone. Gets a bit annoying having to select each item one by one when you want to make batch edits.,
"An incredibly robust task list app. I love the natural language dates. It makes entering tasks super easy. I use it in conjunction with the desktop app. One thing I'd like to see imoroved is the subtask handling. Overall, its great",
"New update ""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Who the hell thought this was a good idea?? Why have you removed a feature people use?? You have made your app far more inconvenient, especially your widget. Please restore this feature. I have been an avid supporter of your app for well over 2 years, recommending it to everyone I know. This is a very disappointing decision.",
"After years of using many different checklist apps, Todoist remains my favourite for its compatibility with the GTD method. It has just the right amount of features. I have alternated between Premium and free, and am currently a Premium user as I really wanted the Label feature.",
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used.",
"I've been using Todoist for several years. I an engineer and like efficient tools. I stumbled upon the app myself when trying out many others. Its definitely the simpliest, best layed out and easy to app I've used. I really love it. Intuitive. Also it sincs on web so I can eaisly share accross devices and computers. Highly reccommend.",
The only problem I (and as I know many others too) have with this app is that I can't see periodic tasks in upcoming days and can only see the upcoming one. This makes difficult to handle and distribute tasks considering available time. Other than that its excellent and complete.,
"So many features and sub categories to keep you organized at all times. It is the best app that I've ever used for tracking important dates. I even use it to track all my bills, and it just gives me the peace of mind that I haven't felt in a long time. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
"This app is perfect for my personal task management. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I like how easy it is to quick add tasks, schedule, and how I can integrate with Gcal. Every idea I have to do anything goes in here. I need reminders for everything; I even use Todoist to remind me to change the sheets :)",
"This app has served me well for a long time, I love it, but its free version is missing one crucial feature for forgetful people like me: Reminders. It's hard to part ways Todoist, but I keep forgetting to do things lately. I'm gonna have to find another task app!",
"Great app that helps me get organized! I love the different projects I can create, plus the inbox and option to set a due date. This has helped me get more done and not lose things like I was before with one long list.",
Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.,
"Downloaded the app several months ago. Was a bit confused at first. Tried again a couple of weeks ago, am now incorporating the app in my daily task toolbox. It's pretty awesome so far! Now I just need to clone myself, and it would be nice if a pocket sized task demon would come give me a slap when I get distracted! üëπ üòÖ",
"I hope the ""completed task"" can be still seen on the list. I also hope new feature will be added: a journal, a habit tracker (literal) and a note-taking feature. Overall, it is a neat app.",
"This app is changing my life. I know it sounds dramatic, but for someone who grew up playing video games (specifically RPG, MMOs, or any other form of roleplaying) this is all sorts of up my alley. I would absolutely recommend this app to any one looking for a great to do app. It's worth the money, especially when you know you spend it elsewhere.",
Just starting to use this. One instant improvement .. the two cogs on the profile and productivity overview LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME. They're also in virtually the same place ... So my brain tells me they'll trigger the same thing. The fact they don't is super confusing. Change one of the icons to something different. I'd be willing to bet you'll get better usage metrics.,
"Wow... A To Do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring. I won't lie, I am absolutely baffled that this is omitted. Maybe it's in the web version, or the iOS version, but I'll never know... You tick a date in the calendar and... Where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx'? Maybe it's a premium feature, I guess I'll never know that either...",
"Very useful for me. Appreciate being able to create projects that I can export/import, but wish I could create recurring tasks as well. I use to keep organized between work and home, and switch between the app and desktop.",
"Arguably the best get-things-done app/online service out there. it runs on every screen, is quick and easy to jot down an idea or task, and is easy to review/ edit. Brain dump - organize - assign - calendarise - complete - celebrate I highly recommend.",
"Some features are not available unless you upgrade, but I'm still testing out the service and not sure I'll need those features. The upgrade is not expensive and the service is pretty slick overall.",
"I'm trying to find the right program to use, not only to get organized but to stay focused on what's important to my business. Todist works great and integrates with other applications I'm using like Trello. I upgraded to premium and will continue to explore and grow using Todist.",
"I'm loving this app. The web browser version is equally amazing since you don't have to go find a bunch of buttons to press to make repeating tasks and can just type ""everyday at 2 pm"" and it very intelligently sets up the reminder for you.",
"Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY.",
"Absolutely essential. I use todoist every single day to keep things organized. The app offers lots of flexibility and an intuitive UX. I have an IFTTT automation that makes my calendar events ibto todoist items, which makes it even more useful.",
Best To Do List App I've ever used. Had multiple other To Do List Apps installed to test which work best for me and this app come out on top. Highly recommended to anyone searching for To Do List options. Even without the premium version this app is ahead brilliant. Nothing is unnecessary complicated and the ability to set daily/weekly goals truly pushes me to get more done.,
"Useful but flawed - biggest issue for me is adding subtasks to recurring tasks. If I mark the subtasks done in January, they are still marked as done when the main task comes around again in Feb. Having checked the help centre, this appears to be intended functionality and can be worked around, but it's really not practical to do so when you have a lot of subtasks",
"This app has helped me become much more organized in my work life. As a construction project manager I value the ability to quickly add the many different tasks and to do items I have from any work station or my phone. Easy to use, plenty of ways to use it well.",
"2022-07J-13th - Over a year later, still using & still a solid 5 stars. I also take back my previous remark concerning being able to set a reoccurrence by typing it. It is incredibly handy. 2021-06J-25th - So far, so good. The ability to set a reoccurrence by typing it in is clever, but less useful than I suspect the developers think it is. I'd rather have a field to pick from. At the moment it seems to have all the functionality I'm after. 2021-06J-24th - Installed & evaluating.",
"I have tried every todo app in play store and this is the best. I am managing an entire project and solely depend on todoist for everything. My only suggestion is, please sort the tasks by priority as default, so even if i add a new task let it get added to its priority order, or else a top priority work i recently added will go unnoticed at the bottom of the list.",
Grate app for people that like lists and bulletpoints for daily tasks and long term goals. Not much I can say in terms of cons. Except it's kinda annoying when it automatically converts associated letters to weekdays and schedules task for that day. Aside from that cool app.,
A nice little app. Liked most aspects of it... But had to uninstall because of just one feature - reminder. I dont know why would someone decide to ship this very basic feature as a premium one! If an app like this reminds me after two days in an email that I have overdue tasks than there is absolutely no purpose of using such an app.,
"I use the free version. There's good integration with Google calendar. I make use of recurring tasks, projects and subtasks. Would be nice if the duration was an attribute of the tall that can be modified",
Great task managing tool. But I looked it better before the update. I used to be able to see all the sub-project when I select the mother project. That makes it easier for me to manage my teams. I wish it at least gives us the option to view those or not.,
"I liked a lot this app, the only problem I'm having os that I don't get any reminder or notification, even though I marked accordingly on settings. I wouldn't mind to pay for the app with I was sure that if with the paid version that would change. That's the only reason I'm looking for another app.",
"I think Todoist is the best ToDo app out there. The free version is pretty awesome by itself, it contains no ads whatsoever. I've recently started using the premium version and I find it perfect. Also the Doist team is very friendly, they answer to all questions via Twitter.",
"after being a dedicated user of a different productivity app for many years i made the change and am now kicking myself for not doing it sooner. I'm already achieving a lot more than i ever did. Constant updates, excellent support files, cross platform. No brainer really.",
"Great app, love it. The downside is they charge 4 euro a MONTH for the optional use of the alarm on the reminder, which is crazy expensive. 48 euro a year and you don't even own the app for that. Not wise charging that much during a pandemic so that's why I'm deducting a star.",
"Easy to use, Nice UI, Dark mode, Active development, Free and Paid, Free offers very nice amount of features, Multi platforms, Syncs, Very helpful for people looking to create a routine, need structure, or just simply to keep a grocery list. I use extensively and love it, plus you can invite and give permissions to others you collab with, like Mamabear ‚òπÔ∏è, she can't help her self with just loading it up. ü§¶üèº",
"I live my life by Todoist! The iphone and Apple desktop apps are great, but I would really like to see an improved desktop app for Chromebooks. The interface is designed for Androids, which makes it clunky and inefficient on a Chromebook.",
"The app is kinda glitchy. My list has lots of tasks that are sub-tasks under a main task. When I press the carrot to expand/collapse a main task, it expands the list, but displays everthing twice. I have to press the carrot again for the list to display correctly.",
This app is easy to use and very helpful; especially since I difficulties in remembering. It reminds me of tasks I didn't complete and I can move unfinished tasks to another day without retyping it. This app has simplified my life. Thank you,
"An extraordinary, life changing, app. There are several excellent YouTube videos on how to really maximize the app under GTD type systems. I use three ""time based"" projects-- This week; Next week; Next month. Additionally, I tag things as ""Today"" when appropriate. Also super important is forwarding emails to my inbox and syncing google calendar. No kidding-- this app changed my life.",
"Recent versions drain battery like crazy Upd: sorry, this message was kept from previous review (with less stars), it looks like you fixed this issue. Currently the only unresolved need - is how to hide irrelevant task until specific time of day (like Snooze in GMail). When I set specific Due Time for task, it always appears above all others for current day, it is quite the opposite of what is expected.",
"It seems a bit complicated, at first, but once you start setting up tasks and projects, the utility becomes more apparent. I went ahead and bought premium. It's not that much and probably worth it for the reminder feature.",
Poor program. Installed it and on first start asked for email or google start up. Clicked on email address linked to phone's account. Waiting and wheel spin for 30 minutes without anything happening. Had to shut down via Close All in Recents. Tried it twice. Recommend other users not to install it. Uninstalled it.,
"Phenomenal organization & deep intuited interface. Love the ability to stream-of-thought tasks in via abstract language. Swipes and movement interfaces really play to the strengths of the mobile platform. Shame the premium features are a subscription. I would spring some $10-20 one time, but I despise subscriptions.",
"Ridiculously stupid user interface. Eg. I could not figure out why the tasks I was drafting would disappear mid-air when I tried adding a reminder. Today, I finally realised that if I set a reminder for a task, I have to use the back button of my phone to be able to go back to the menu where I was writing the task and complete it. However, if I use the back arrow button in the app, it erases the task I was writing with no warning. Makes no sense at all. Would not recommend.",
Very robust to-do app. I love the ability to collaborate and work on to-do items without finalizing or finishing that item. Also has various ways to organize to-do items to make it very organized and neat.,
"There are glitches in the Android app that aren't in the web app. (I love the web app) Would give this 5 stars if Todoist fixed them, and introduce a bug reporting feature so that bugs like these don't remain unfixed. Dragging subtasks is often glitchy and doesn't parent under the correct parent task, or just reorders back to original placement after I drag it to a parent task. The @ and # symbol rarely actually pops up with label auto recognition as I type like it does on the web app.",
"Let me keep this simple, I paid for a year. Then tried to find something cheaper. Spent a year trying out various task apps. Have now returned to Todoist, bit the bullet and paid ¬£35. The free version suits most people but I wanted the extras.",
"While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.",
"Paid version probably is good, but.... free version is seriously restricted. Does not live up to reviews, which I am now guessing are mostly premium users. A simple example, reminders cost. 4 colors included, but a simple other one costs. Etc",
"Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!",
"Wunderlist was better. They've ruined what was a great simple list app. It annoyingly emails you to tell you things each day that you havnt done, I was. using it as a shopping list!!! So Iv deleted my account, uninstalled it and gone back to Google notes. Shame, this is what happens when conpanies buy good independent apps and then stuff them up",
"The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated.",
"ive used it personally for 2 years. fantastic app works on my iPad, android and windows 10 machines and has a handy chrome extension. seriously has helped me stay organized and even become more disciplined with my time. cannot say enough good things. 12/10 would recommend.",
"I very rarely rate apps but I just have to show my appreciation for this app - it's fantastic. The recurring tasks are a great way for me to keep calm and not have to remember all the small things I need to do every day in my head. It's so easy to use and having it as a widget for a daily to do list is so helpful. Amazing job, developers! :)",
"I really like this app. The fact that there is no way to set the calendar display either as a widget or as the first thing that opens when you click on the app, really impedes my use of the app. If I could set the calendar as the first thing that popped up when I click on the app, I would be the happiest camper.",
"The developers understand the ""stay out of the way"" concept and it makes this a really great tool. Bonus points for the unified cross-platform experience and integration with Spark, very cool! Would live to see text labels added inside the swipe action so you know what you are about to do.",
"It took me a few tries to really implement this app. I have always loved Todoist, but I didn't have enough going on in my life to put an app like this to good use. Lately though, I've needed to organize several personal projects as well as tasks for work, doctor appointments, etc. So I turned back to Todoist. It's only gotten better... I will continue to use it daily! :))",
"Todoist is the best personal calendar and TODO list I have ever seen. It is also great for Shopping lists, reminders, appointment tracking, etc. It is especially useful if you want to see it on multiple devices.",
This has really been helpful. Having the extension on my chrome browser connect to the app on my phone is very convenient. easy to keep track of my assignments I need to do. It automatically syncs between the two.,
"Great app. Very useful and anyone in the team can input things to be done, sign dates, times and team member responsible. Lacking the ability to assign multiple people to a task rather than just one person, but that may be because I'm using the free version.",
"Working well so far, im using free version and it has many features that are helping me to stay organized. The multiple projects and levels of tasks (parent/child) are handy way to organize further. I am working three prat time jobs that i have to manage my tasks and time myself, and this app os helping a bunch!",
"I loved the widget but they removed a very useful feature: to be able to open the app from the widget. It's not possible to reorganize tasks from the widget, the only way is through the app. However now it has become bothering to open the app. I hope they will bring this feature back",
"After using every single famous to do app out there, in fact after creating my own webapp. I found the best thing out there. Pros: 1. Extensions, Add-ons: There is an add-on for everything under the sun. Extension for chrome, extension for opera, add-on for gmail, heck add-on for outlook as well. 2. The regex feature of adding deadline by just typing ""next Wednesday"" Super cool. 3. Ability to add repeating task like ""read a random chapter from Statistics by Kirk every six days from next Fri"" !",
"I like it okay, so far. But I'm flabbergasted at one behavior. I entered the task ""Do house clean this early evening"". Todoist DELETED the words ""this early evening"" and arbitrarily scheduled a time. I didn't want that. I tried to read-add the text, but it kept deleting it and scheduling the job for 7 pm. The only way I could have time information remain in the task name was to misspell it! I changed ""early evening"" to ""earli evening"". It worked, but it's ridiculous.",
Great app! I get more done in my day. It helps me remember things that I need to do during my day that I usually forget about. I get to focus on one thing at a time vs feeling overwhelmed. I purchased the premium version and I think it is worth it. I can even assign a task to a someone who is collaborating with me in a project.,
"So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day.",
"I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?",
"Horrible. I have MS and bad memory issues so was hoping this would help keep me on task. Put about 15 tasks in, didnt ""swipe"" to complete, but they disappeared and were marked as complete. Couldnt see them again unless I get Premium version!",
"This is the only to do app that I've kept up working with for so long. So, it's really handful for someone who's not accustomed to ""to-do lists"". However, there's a minor problem to it: when you put a colon in front of a task, you can't mark it as done anymore. I'd be happy to see it fixed up in the next updates.",
"Please allow more complexity in setting recurring tasks for example daily routine go to bed at 10pm ev weekday and go to bed at 12am ev fri, sun. It's frustrating having to create multiple tasks for the same recurring task just because I want it set to a different time. Will leave my review at 1 star and upgrade to 5 once fixed. Look forward to any updates from Devs on this one.",
have been using the app since my undergraduate days in college. I wish there was an audio feedback while ticking the checklists in the task just like in wunderlist. There's a need of more integrations special with Microsoft business account.,
"This app is my best bud! I've been using this app for almost a year now and I'm very satisfied. However, there is a lit bit issue in using the Todoist widget, I can't directly open my todo's from the widget sooo I had to go open the app instead. Though, it's not a big issue for me but I hope this can be solve hihi. (but maybe my phone is the problem?) Anyways, Keep up the Good work!‚úã",
I've never been very organized and todo lists often go blank. Todoist is easy enough that making a list doesn't feel like a burden or a waste of time. I've been using it for about 3mo now consistently.,
it would be incredible if we could set up when our day ends instead of auto reset at midnight. For those of us who stay up late it would help tremendously with the gamification of the app. Thats why i put 4 stars. Thank you for an amazing app regardless üôè,
"The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great. Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
"Still learning how to use it, but so far so good! I like how you can set up daily, weekly, etc. tasks to be recurring so you don't have to constantly re-add them. My one complaint is that setting tasks for specific dates that aren't tomorrow or next week is a bit tricky.",
beautiful app. very simple to use but also has a lot of features. I especially love being able to subsubtask my subtasks and subsubsubtask my subtasks. the only criticism is that the reminder feature is hidden behind paywall. it would be better if only customizations were a paid features or if there was a one time paid option instead of monthly.,
Todoist has been great. But what would be great is to not be faced daily with a to do list widget that's incapacitated by a refresh circle. Never was a problem until recently. Now I'm in a spot where I would just leave the widet in its useless state because of how much I just want the widget to show me what I need without a prodding from an opened app. Looks like I'll be trying some other means that has never disappeared on me this whole time.,
"App is not for me. I paid $4.00 for 1 month of Premium service and is still shows I am using the free app. I immediately contacted customer service (twice), and it's been more than 2 weeks into the 1 month I paid for and I still have not received a response from anyone at Todoist. I'm still trying to figure out how to customize this app to suit my needs, but since I don't have the Premium app in order to do that, I will be uninstalling this app.",
"it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick.",
"This app is life changing. I'm terrible at organizing and keeping myself on track, but Todoist has changed all of that. With a little bit of habit building, I'm more organized than I've ever been and less stressed. I cannot recommend this app enough.",
"I am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks/projects I have scheduled, so I end up missing out on things I want to take care of. I have it turned on in Settings. Why is that?... I utilize the Smart Schedule tool, but still no notification. Pls help or fix.",
"Great app, now I put down every single plan which comes to my mind and there is easier to manage it and make it complete. I haven't tested premium yet, but I think it would be even more helpeful to reach the goals.",
"I thought this app was just ok, then I learned about the smart scheduling. Being able to schedule a task in for 'every Tuesday' or 'on the 25th of every month' really revolutionized my to do list. Now this app is indispensable.",
"The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you.",
"It works pretty well, particularly in shared tasks and in linking to Android Assistant. I find the interface to not be as i would like, but that might just be me not knowing how to use it the most efficiently.",
"The UX for this app is way beyond similar apps like Google keep and one note. The user interface is also very intuitive. the organization system is also to an extent is manipulable to the users need, which is fantastic. really well designed",
"It looks like it will run smoothly with helpful features, and I like how clean and simple UI is. I'm a bit disappointed I won't get reminders without Pro though? I'm worried this app will be near useless for my goldfish memory if I don't pay for the membership. :/ Am I missing something?",
"This app is changing my life! I started slow but once you get going it's almost addictive and karma points for completing tasks on time were a real nice surprise. Enjoy this app alot and highly recommend it, very easy to use and convenient.",
"App is easy to use and helps me stay focused on my goals, both personal and professional. The reminders are a great bonus and syncing with Google Calendar makes it so I can track my Todoist tasks alongside the events recorded in Calendar.",
"Todoist was good enough for me, but I was a free tier user. Recently I discovered that my todo list is growing because I eventually forget things that are in the list. A feature to get reminders is behind the paywall. Todo list without a reminder? Please give reminders for free tier too, you can monitize in other ways like advanced stats etc",
"Don't know if there's a paid version, but the free one is fully functional and without any ads. It would be exactly what I need... if not for the fact that whenever I add new item or try to change order of tasks on a list, some other tasks also randomly change their place on a list. It is a dealbreaker for me, as I sort things in specific order to do them in that exact order. edit: I am talking about a bug in project view. others have the same problem from what I've gathered.",
"Maybe it works for some people, but this was absolutely the worst 'to do list' app I have tried! Every time I opened it, therr was a 'feature' blocking my use. The ultimate problem was finding no task delete function.",
"its easy to use and works across multiple platforms. you can colour code and add as many categories with the premium version. i use it for work meetings and for personal use, it has helped me manage numerous projects so far! highly recommended",
"I had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks, 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens. Also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk. Poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers.",
I've tried a bunch of these to-do apps. This one gives you the most for free. You can sync two devices on the free tier. Phone and laptop are enough for most people. No ads no pushy upgrade messages.,
"Intuitive UI, nothing essential is stripped away for free use. Would be 5 starr except for no calendar view for events, or any view with easy-access more than 7 days out - makes it difficult at a glance to see jf setting up a meeting a month away would conflict with, say, a Doctor's appointment.",
"This App has really transformed the way i go about my routine life. it helped me declutter and minimize daily stress.it can be improved further however by letting users reorder the day's tasks and setting deadlines to individual tasks, which offcourse require more time to be completed. it should also introduce its own calender within the app to enable users to look at their activities in a broader context.",
"Paying a monthly fee is not acceptable IMO. I would gladly pay a one time fee for it. I still use apps from years ago that are still used from one phone to the next. If I had to pay a monthly fee to keep those this whole time would be way too much for what they're worth. This is a good app, with plenty of features, but not worth $36 a year.",
"A task management system is crucial in my system so I don't forget things and Todoist fulfills all of my needs, even with a basic account. The smart auto-text recognition when typing in tasks is also very useful at reducing the time it takes for new tasks to be entered so I'm more likely to keep updating and using this system.",
I am very satisfied with this App. I does what i expected it to do including reminding about the things to do ans repeating tasks every month. I also love how it is super easy to use and even easier to type in the Task with predictive dates and stuff Overall great app!,
"This app has pretty much the best NLP system from all competitors, very easy to add new tasks quickly. One of the places it could improve is for notifications. Having quick actions for notifications (+15 min, next day, etc) would be very useful (similar to what TickTick does for notification)",
"The GREATEST personal organization app I have used. Cool and simple user experience, works on all major platforms so you can access your lists from virtually anywhere. If you are looking for a way to get organized and productive, this what you are looking for.",
"They want you to pay a premium for reminders. You gotta be kidding me. A premium membership. For a ""to do list"" app. What has this world come to. Also it has you log in with your Google account or email. I downloaded a couple other to do list apps that don't require a login, and don't require a premium membership for reminders.",
"Generally pretty good, but a lot of awkward design choices: no compact mode, inefficient use of colors for organization, difficulty selecting and moving tasks, lack of icon consistency, preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself.",
"Best task scheduling app. And I've tried many. I'm using it to break long term goals into smaller incremental goals, and to handle recurring housrhold tasks. Sadly, no task app can stop me from over-committing myself to too many tasks on a daily basis...",
"So I've cancelled the subscription and it showed me that I have premium until December 20-ish, imagine my surprise when it charged me for next month anyway. I asked support for a refund but they said it's impossible, ""but you can use our app for one more month"". Well, I didn't want to. I don't see any feature to unbind my card either, so I am afraid I need to delete account to make sure this bloody app won't charge me again against my will. For not allowing refunds and no unbind - 1 star.",
"I don't consider reminders as premium features, if you could make it as a single feature purchase I would definitely buy that. The other features are okay and the price is good, but reminders are just unnecessarily premium. Besides from being available for Linux, I don't find anything unique in Todoist that others doesn't have.",
"This app IS great, and has the potential to be greater! However, my only 2 requests is when you add a ""Parent Project"" to your ""Favorites,"" please include the projects within it as well! And to also make setting alarms to your tasks more simple, and reliable. Thanks!",
"Latest update has a bug rendering it useless - in certain projects, noticeably once marked as ""Favourites"", when tapping ""add task"", nothing happens. Huawei Honor 10. Edit: They fixed it. Thanks. Excellent app and responsive team üòÅ",
"Great app, using it all the time... Would be great to have a toggle for switching on and off the view of the completed tasks in ""today"" mode. This motivates even more, if you see how many things you accomplished today...",
"Spam!!!!. Trying to remove the notification on the email for the past month after uninstalling the app, and it doesn't allow me. Asking to install the app again, and it didnot work for me. How many times I need to xlick tje option to remove the notification? I get 2 emails of due tasks *EVERYDAY*, SO Annoying. =oI",
"the interface is so unintuitive. why does the ""submit"" button have an icon of a paper airplane making it look like a ""send"" button. Reschedule? I'm not rescheduling i'm actually adding the time and date for the task and so on....",
"Excellent app, in my opinion the best productivity app out there. Simple and intuitive user interface and it integrates with anything else you can think to pair it with (Google Calendar, Gmail, etc.). It's the easiest to use and most effective app I use daily.",
I use it for writing things I need to do later. I like how you can priorities items and set due dates. I also like the feature of repeating task. It is easy to use. intuitive. great way to get organised.,
Good interface. Will not sync shared projects between devices (Web and Samsung S9+). Followed all troubleshooting steps provided on website. Syncs correctly when using web interface. Good app for those who are using the web interface.,
"The app is very good, but after the change in scheduling settings the feature is not convenient at all. Each time I need to schedule the task to a certain time - it's a torture.",
"its pretty good, very functional. a cool widget that makes it easy to see your tasks. i wish i could opt out of the emails. and i wish they had a set up for late tasks that was less anxiety indusing. it has a good grouping feture, and a good repeating task feture",
"Worth paying for premium. This app helped me organize my life and breaks down big scary projects into simple tasks. The interface is a little confusing at first, but when you learn it, its extremely helpful. Cant recommend this app enough",
"Useful app. Easy to use and handy. EXCEPT - the Todoist calendar only shows the NEXT occurence of a recurring task, not ALL recurrences. This is a recipe for a scheduling conflict, and big omission for an app like this.",
Makes keeping track of everything so much easier! Worth the subscription. I love that I can capture things I need to do in seconds - then later come back and figure out where those things fit in my overall plan.,
I am very impressed with Todoist. I've been using Google Tasks which was nowhere near as flexible. Being able to organize across projects with priorities and easy rescheduling makes this app very effective at helping me stay organized.,
"An awesome way to get organized, STAY organized, and feel like you actually accomplished something with your day! It's easy to use, has boatloads of useful features, and has honestly improved my productivity so very much. Would 100% recommend!",
"Seems like a really good app but just did not suit my needs. As someone with adhd, reminders are essential and to have them locked behind a pay wall is just quite useless. Without reminders I don't even remember to open the app throughout the day. But still a very good app, just not quite for me.",
"It took me 2 days to notice the ""show completed tasks"" command. Until then I couldn't see how to use this app as a Journal (I.e. looking into the past), not just a planning tool, and had started looking for another app that would do both. To use this app as a diary, you type your diary entry as the name of a new task, assign it to Today (so that it will be displayed with the date) in a special project e.g. ""Diary"" (can only be done before the task is completed) and click the box to complete it.",
"Great for organizing and planning your tasks. Also the app is very responsive, even on an older phone. No wait time, no frustration, just add tasks within seconds, right from your phone's home screen",
"needs a dedicated habit tracking tab, one where you can see your history. Unlike a task, it would be nice to see a habit tracking history. Besides this, one of the best productivity apps out there. üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ",
Super app... Can keep tracks of different types of lists really well... Just one thing I wish they had the slide and add more things in a section even in the today tomorrow next week lists It would make the process faster Than choosing the date in the calender again n again.,
Amazing. It feels really premium and polished even for the free version and they don't make it so core functionality needs to be paid for. I have been using it for years and would make this the must download app for everyone.,
"This app is AWESOME! I love how convenient it is to setup quick projects and tasks. i do wish we could share more than projects. I want to make and share a simple grocery list, having to make a ""Project"" list for that seems silly, buuuuut thats just verbage. love it, thank you for the wonderful app!",
"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools.",
"There is an issue in this app where comments dont show up on mobile app but you can see it on desktop or web. I have to logout from the app for the comments to appear. This happens every now and then. When it happens, I just need to logout and login but I find that inconvenient. Pls fix.",
Been using the free version for a few days. Very good functionality. Was previously using Google keep. The ability to divide tasks by project and the ability to assign priorities are clear improvements.,
"Excellent way to keep organized. More features in the free tier and better customer service than competitors. As soon as they implement automatic dark mode, it will be everything I could ask for.",
"I've put all the productivity apps through their paces and ToDoist is the clear winner for me. Its biggest strength is it's ability to be adapted to many different workflows and ways of thinking. Too many other apps seem limited in that domain. Currently it works very well as part of the GTD system for me. Highly recommend premium, especially for a GTD setup.",
"OK so I have tried a few and this looks to be a well rounded feature rich app that probably does everything I want it to do. I easily integrated it to my Trello board via a power up, nice. Ok so lets set a reminder for my first task! Seriously, reminders are Pro only pffff. Laters.",
"been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better. it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context, add a label and move to a different project.",
"So far enjoying the app. Only complaint is that in Board view, if you swipe up/down just a few degrees from vertical it interprets it as a horizontal swipe. Not a deal breaker, just annoying. Thanks!",
"As a digital product designer I especially find the user experience on this app phonemenal, everything I think of every feature, how it works, where it's placed is exactly the way I want it to be and this only tells you that the user testing team did their job and conducted their interviews. This app is a blessing to have, an app that states boldly the outcome when all parts involved do it right. Just an admirable piece of user experience I fortunately get to use everyday.",
"Integrates nicely with web version. Some of the tagging and organization is more intuitive in a browser, but it's still a great little to do list app. I love how effective the repeat scheduling features are.",
Have used Todoist over many other organizers for quite a while now. Current version has a bug that prevents me from turning off the morning reminder so I've had to disable all notifications. The free version limit on boards coming out of nowhere was pretty awful too.,
"I've been using this app for three years and it has changed my life. At a certain level they could create more milestones for goals achieved and hope they keep building this, but for now it's what I recommend often for anyone trying to get more disciplined at their ü•Ö.",
"Fits GTD model like a glove. Simple, easy to use, functional, multiplatform, intuitive gem of an application. The only thing I would add is geo-tagging of tasks for location based notifications. EDIT: just realized geo tagging is here as well. üòÇ",
"This was really good until the app just stopped working. You'd start the app and just get a black black page, ending up with warning message after warning message saying that the app had stopped working. Tried restarting the app and the phone and the message wouldn't stop appearing.",
"Great app! I have an issue with updating a widget on homescreen. The days in ""coming"" mode didn't update until I tap on some of the tasks. Previously, everything was updated without problems and unnecessary interactions.",
"This is the best to-do app I've tried. I love being able to organize my tasks into color-coded folders. It works great both on mobile and desktop. The reminder function is well worth paying for, and the cost is very reasonable.",
"Spent about 5h on creating tasks. Verified before closing, everything was there, was nicely saved. The next day I discover that there are no tasks ... Just 5h of working in vain. And the interesting thing, there is nothing in trash or in history as well. Horrible app",
"I really like the app and how easy it is to organize projects. The only thing I would want added is that tasks due on a specific day can be seen on the calendar when picking due dates for tasks, instead of just their colour code.",
"I was never satisfied with any ToDo app. I always wanted something which was missing. I don't know what it was but it wasn't satisfying. But this changed the game. ToDoist is by far the best task management app, I have ever used. The way it is designed gives very satisfying experience. I am 100% satisfied with the product.",
"Todoist has been improving I would love to see an optimization of the ""Share"" image as comment. It has bugs and fails regularly. Example : When saving a screenshot to a project on Android. I usually recieve a notification saying that it failed.",
Very flexible interference that can fit almost everyone. I highly recommend everyone who have anything that he needs to do to use this app as you can diverge and manage your things very easily with this app very easy to understand but also extremely powerful tool of filters if you're a pro user,
"This is a really helpful app for personal use. I like just having basic to do lists for each day. I would like a better calendar view though, so I could use it instead of Google calendar. I am trying to build habits and routines, and this app is good for setting recurring tasks.",
Easy to use and effective. I have become more productive ever since I began using it. Access to my list on my phone or computer proves very useful especially at times when my phone was unavailable. Highly recommend to anyone trying to create structure in their lives.,
"My personal favorite task manager. Natural language has a bit of a learning curve, so if there is a feature you expected it is likely accessible via the natural language task input. A dark theme and cross-platform features also elevate it above the competition.",
I'm disabled so detailed planning and recording tasks is vital! Tried many apps and like Todoist enough for day to day I got Pro. + Sync with GCal [Home + Gmail] + Fairly easy to use + Cross platform - subtasks (STs) that recur. e.g.  'Accounts' has 8 STs. If STs set to recur ALL of them show up in GCal (month view) but if not I must add them every time (or do/undo which breaks my task count). - no journal option - complicated export - can't mark tasks as done on previous day,
"Great app! Easily share lists with others. Easy to add or check off items. One enhancement request would be to make another default view option the list of all projects, rather than having to choose one project to default view.",
"New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise.",
"I've tried multiple Productivity apps and the learning curve has always been pretty steep. Not so much with Todoist! A smooth UI and lots of , but not too much, functionality. Great work developers",
"Amazing app, clean layout, no ads. Helps me put my thoughts onto a list and get things done. Have recommended to family and friends when I hear they're still using pen and paper. Love the cross platform support. App available on all platforms, even Linux.",
Super simple but lifesaving app. I don't really like using phone calendars to plan out my day because there are too many useless features and it takes very long to set everything up. But when I downloaded Todoist I started planning everything.,
"Todoist is garbage. Nevermind the idiotic text-based method for creating daily tasks, this stupid app seems to think ""every day"" is a suggestion, even with Premium. Been using this app for three weeks & every few days, it refuses to renew my daily tasks. Scheduled reminders disappear. Curse & blast whoever EOL'd Wunderlist cuz it was perfect for my needs. This todoist trash? Not at all. I will cling to Wunderlist until the very end.",
"I've never paid for a productivity app until I started using Todoist. It is THE BEST task management app out there. Simple, clean, beautifully designed, easy to use, and packed with features. Definitely recommend it.",
Lots of great features while remaining simple and easy to use. Works great across platforms. I love the new update it added features and tightened up the UI without making arbitrary changes or feeling bloated.,
Great App! being able to track down and see the tasks you've accomplished is so great! that's why I really love it 'coz its make me more productive. But I was hoping you can add the Pomodoro technique to make users more productive and will be able to track how much time will we spent on a task.,
"As a genius, it was one of the most useful apps I've ever used in my entire life! Everything is pretty simple; complicated things are also made of a lot of simple parts; and this app allowed me to manage my complicated tasks! Just imagine you could manage a huge marriage ceremony just by using this app, thinking! Or an essay, a school project, plan for a journey, your goals, your dates and everything! This app just made me wondered! And I'm really speechless for more! It's a masterpiece! üëçüôèüòá",
"Favorite to do list let! It is cross platform, cloud based, and there are short cuts for everything so my to dos can get easily organized at the task or project level and cover both timing and priority needs. Love this service!",
"12 hours, just 12 hours I had this app. Received 6 emails for todoist. Why do you think it is acceptable to bombard me with email? On top of the email issue, to make any real use of this app you have to sign up for the premium service. Wont be coming back. Uninstalled and you been added to my junk email list. Pathetic!",
"The most intuitive & simple function is to be able set tasks. Create the task w a description, then choose the frequency & specific days. I can't create a simple daily task for Monday through Friday without creating a weekly task for each of those 5 days. An app lacking that simple function creating more work for the user is one I can't get behind using. Nothing in help section resolved this most basic issue. If that capability exists its impossible to find. 30 minutes & I'm giving up.",
"Been loving it so far until recent update, I don't get the ""UNDO"" prompter anymore when I ""accidentally"" completed a task! SUGGESTION: Can we have a ""Recently Completed Tasks"" in the Navigation Menu please? (I believe this is consistent with many input by other reviewers/users/customers ~.^) 1 week's worth of it is good enough. Thank you!",
"the interface is easy and very slick. helps me and getting things done. rescheduling a task as a breeze. changing priority or sequence of tasks for the day is also very easy, just a drag and shift.",
"Very easy to use, and does the things I want it to. It's worth learning the text entry shortcuts for things like due date and project. I also find the premium features to be worth having.",
"Todoist Allows you to carefully plan your activities and be accountable for their completion. Also, if you remember an undone chore, you can quickly put it into the app and the likelihood of you doing that thing tripples.",
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer.",
"Good App. Make it better still. We need: 1. Recurrent task/reminders. Need to set a daily or weekly reminder for a task, not just a deadline or completion date. Also it would allow to set a reminder for regular daily routines (exercise, meditation, language' etc) 2. WhatsApp integration. The reminders appear as Whatsapp message (optional). Many people still use WhatsApp for projects ans business. 3. Alternatively, Share options to distribute tasks by email, whatsapp, etc",
"Please, make the widget minimalistic like in com.stuff.todo. upd: new widgets are far better than b4. looking forward for the ability 2 chnge fonts/opacity (roboto thin/condensed light = great; montserrat too). also would b great 2 have an option 2 make tags invisible + changin color accents to custom/theme aligned like red dates etc (and/or make it grab the accent from bg picture). compact view is not an option, I like the orig spacing. last 1: cut off the header, widgt cusomizes while creation",
"I love so many things about this app: the cross platform support, the responsive interface, the project segments, and the inbox organization. I use this for so many things now, and may consider subscribing the longer I use it",
"Very happy with Todoist after trying various. Easy to pick up and the nice widgets to display and quick add have very quickly become part of my routine, and stuck. Others have lacked smoothness in that area, best I've tried.",
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker.",
"Its a great app and encourages productivity. A nitpick i have with the newest update is that the ""sorted by due date"" still appears in the widget screen, and is kind of annoying. It would be nice if that is removed, thanks!",
"Great all-around app. Free features are enough for most users, though thete are some nice premium perks for upgrading. Love being able to create items using natural voice. This app is tough to beat. I keep trying other apps and always return here.",
"Simple but powerful and I can use it with Google Home! If you download the IFTTT app, you can integrate the two and add tasks to your default list or add items to your shopping list. Works on your phone by voice or on Google home. And the app itself is great.",
"I have been having a great experience with the app. I love how I make updates on my PC, and they reflect on all my other devices. So handy, and it's made me so much more productive both at work, and at home! I also really like the flexibility of the widget.",
"This isn't your mother's to do list. It has many layers and after 3 weeks I still feel as though I'm learning how to fully use it. Having said that, you can make it as simple or as detailed as you wish. I already feel more on top of things and look forward to learning how to maximize the benefits of Todoist. Use the tutorials.",
"Too Expensive. I was going to use this for managing my business and my sons education. However, I am not going to pay $8 a month per person using that app when I there are perfectly free good apps that do the same. Do not recommend. I mean honestly, it's not that complex keeping track of tasks, and I am not going to pay a subscription fee for a to do app.",
"This helps me to be so much more organized! Huge improvement over my random pieces of paper and lists all over the place. It's simple, fluid, and easy to use. (Written after one week of use.)",
"If it were a one off payment for the premium version, I'd pay it in a heartbeat, but who (apart from a very rich person) would pay ¬£36 per year, amounting to ¬£180 to use some extra features on a phone app for 5 years? No thanks!",
I paid for the pro and of course they make it a pain to cancel. The tasks and reminders take way too many buttons to press and it doesn't even sound an alarm or anything just a notification. I bought this because i need something better than Google calendar but its worse because you have to pay.,
Indispensible. I use this to keep both my professional and personal life organized. I find the calendar integration to be very helpful. I also sync both calendar and Todoist to the Momentum dashboard extension for Chrome.,
Very good so far! I have been playing around with this for a week and have found it useful but not annoying with reminders and access via multiple devices. really like how you can group projects too.,
"I really can't speak to the full experience, because I do not have the premium version, but so far the free version has helped me with keeping my projects and tasks in one place. I am still getting the hang of prioritizing, but that is more of a personal thing.",
"+ Simple, pretty, you can make folders, it works cross plattform which is really importany for me. - Sometimes it bothers me that it converts some text automatically into dates and it doesn't seem you can turn it off. e i wish i could just write ""thursday",
"No Reminders. After installation and setting and adding entire to do list with reminders, I missed couple of important calls. When I checked why I didn't get a reminder, app mag said reminders are only available in PRO version. Why the hell are you not mentioning these things upfront? Ohh yes, coz then people won't download this shot.",
"It was one of the best tasks/project management apps. I loved it and used a lot. Now, after last updates mobile UI become completely unusable and inconvenient for me. A lot of space used in efficient way for ugly bottom app bar :(",
"I highly recommend Todoist. Easy to add tasks and move them around as needed. Since it's on my phone and always by my side, I easily add tasks on the go by typing or by voice. Whenever I get overwhelmed with things that need to be done, I use Todoist to prioritize my day by assigning a 1, 2, 3 or 4 priority.",
"I've been using todoist with my team for while and now I have to ditch it because it has many bugs and they often don't get fixed quickly enough. Basic things like syncing often have issues for some reason, and it's very painful to use it.",
I love this app! It keeps all my projects and tasks organised and helps me to stay in control. Really easy to use and once you've set everything up it keeps you on track. Highly recommended.,
This app has been super helpful for me in organizing my tasks on a daily basis. Is there any way you can integrate a feature that shows completed tasks? It would be great for keeping track in projects or just the feeling of completion and being productive that is very rewarding for the user. Thank you!,
"I've been using Todoist for about 2 weeks now. In that time I've gone from post it notes and the apple reminders app on my phone to everything on Todoist. One of the great things for me is that I can create ""projects"" for general day to day things that need doing and I can also create ""projects"" for work tasks that need to be done. The app refreshes seemlessly on my phone when I'm ticking off my shopping list and on my desktop in the office checking off daily tasks. Big thumbs Todoist!",
Add habit track and focus mode just like in tick tick app (your competitors). Over all I like tick tick more because of these features but because that company is based in China really concerned about data protection laws. That is the only reason I will stick with todoist. Pls add gamified habit track and focus mode,
"This is a great app that has sharing of tasks and recurrence. It took me a long time to find the exact thing for what we needed for a household chores, and this is perfect! it also has great integration across multiple platforms.",
"it's hard to edit tasks because it doesn't have multi select. also hope that I can see a proper calendar in here. and I can't turn my sub tasks as a main task and vise versa. Edit: I see, I couldn't multi-select because I was trying to hold the task to select it. But the subtasks in projects, they're all nested inside the main task, I can't move them. I can change the subtasks in the inbox tho.",
"Simple & Sweet. No unnecessary clutter - just things I need to do, organised by category and date. Slick interface and cool date parsing are highlights. Can also integrate with Google Home but I didnt find much use for that.",
"I have been using this app for a few weeks, and it has been a tremendous help in making me organized and less stressed. I love the user interface. I can create a task, set its due date, its priority, and its category (project) all from the keyboard. However, I wish that I could look farther ahead than 7 days. When I schedule a task to a day two weeks from now, I want to see what specific things I have going on that day (not just how many tasks) so that I can make sure that I can do it then.",
"I've been enjoying the app. I love how I can easily set recurring tasks. There's just one thing I wish I could change. I wish I could change the hour at which a new day begins. I know that sounds weird, but I am a night owl and usually don't go to bed until after midnight. Before I settle down for the night, I like to review my day and check off tasks that I forgot to check off earlier. But by the time I do that, it is technically a new day and the tasks are automatically marked overdue.",
Awesome app. Best of all the apps I've used. Just one suggestion- please add a feature that allows the user to add an image like a cover image for each project. It would look more good aesthetically.,
"App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features.",
greaaaaaat app. Should support more languages for shortcuts and make icons instead of colours for projects (or make both options possible). Reminders would be great to have for free and monthly payments are a bit too much for me... a one time payment would be best,
"Some functions are frustrating. I was trying to enter tasks as theyre described in an assignment with things like part a, b, or c, but it always changed anything with a part ""a"" to a time. If I manually changed it so there was no time, it deleted the rest of the text.",
"Makes a less-than-good first impression on new users by makng word input as scheduling as cryptic as possible and having no undo for marking things done, or way of looking up what you accidentally marked as done. A pain in the neck in many ways.",
"This app is amazing! üíï Everything is much easier with this app, you can easily organize all of your tasks, and you can set schedule, reminders, even prioritize those tasks. It is very simple but helpful! üíñ Definitely my fav productivity app ever üòç",
"Today (9/19) my filters have disappeared. They are still present and functioning on my computers but not on my phone. The dev asked if I would try logging out and back in. Yesterday and again today I tried just force stopping the app, and that didn't work. Logging out and back in did work. Back to normal.",
Hands down the best task management platform ever. Use it for work and personal stuff. It's a bit dangerous as it can become a crutch: these days if it doesn't go on todoist it doesn't get done. But this is a testament to the quality of the app. Can't wait for boards!,
"thank you so much please never go away hmm suggestion though is the ability to add more than one subtasks at a time. every time i add one, i had to select the task every single time. so that would be really useful, if that feature is already there too and i just didnt know about it, i apologize.",
Great app across multiple platforms. my only quibble is I have to turn the smart date function on and off as it's not very totally reliable. I would like to be able to the smart date function on and off as needed in each task,
Definitely needs a way to have a daily to-do list. Add a feature where I can put items like 'make bed' and 'meditate' as daily tasks and not have to type them in everyday and it's a 5 star app. Just looking for a way to open the app and start chocking daily tasks off without making a long list everyday over and over.,
Good but I must activate the pro version to get a lot of features. The free version does not make it easy to use because it makes no distinction between freemium and paid features in the UI.,
This is a great and simple app to organize tasks and projects. If there was one area that could use improvement it would be the need to visualize tasks in a in-app calendar or gantt view.,
"This is one of those amazing, rare apps, that I had to leave a review for. It has pretty much everything I could think of, presented in a very sleek design with customisable widgets. Just download it and see for yourself!",
"Todoist has always been useful whenever I purposefully open the app. It is only now when I ""explored"" a bit and figured how I could simply add it to my notification panel or even highlight and share a word and immediately export it to the app is when I realized how convenient it really is üòÅ. What can I say, I'm a noob with technology lol",
Forced to update the app only to be charged for labels. Stop charging for things that used to be free. The app barely does anything with the free version. It's getting to the point that the default notes app in your phone is more competent than this app,
"Have been using the app for several years now, just love the simple interface, and most importantly the reliability of the app and synchronization across platforms. Highly recommended",
"Very nice app that helps you organize your tasks and time. Links with Google calendar for the best experience. Has a pro version with a monthly payment, but is still very useful without.",
"Good functionally but slow app. The widget almost never updates, and the app itself lags heavily on ticking off items. This didn't used to be the case but is also true for the Windows app to now. Unless this is improved I doubt I'll be resubbing.",
I've tried a few to do list apps and this is the best by far. The amount of features you get is fantastic. Homescreen widget is the icing on the cake along with cross platform support with Linux!,
"Numerous bugs exist. The main one affecting me is once you've added a task, it is impossible to amend it as the changes you make will not be saved. Try to change a one-off task due today into a repeating daily task, it recognises the modification by changing the font, but then you click save and nothing happens.",
"Irritating. Can't say more than one word for your list, goats cheese comes up as goats. No more than 3 items per list on the ""board"" I deleted my tasks before adding sub items by tapping them. Monday board is easier to use than this, with videos to show you how to do it on youtube.",
"I've tried a ton of different ""to do"" apps, planners, calendars, etc...and this is one of my favorites because it's clean, easy to understand, doesn't have tons of extra things going on - it sticks to what you need instead of trying to jam pack everything into one app - and it's extremely affordable for the premium version....which is, in my opinion, a must have.",
"using the free todoist account with the app. the app works great, provides a nice clean interface and is for the most part doing exactly what it should. would recommend as a todo app, it even has a nice widget to use on your home screen",
"incredible app. feature suggestion: a swipe-enabled task tracker feature (swipe to open on-screen list) like Xiaomi's ""Quick Notes"" feature. tried switching to their app just for that feature, but it just wasn't as sophisticated as Todoist.",
This is the most extremely useful tool I've found in my third month of my first ever semester in college. It really pushes me to the tasks I need to do. It is very helpful. I use this in both my phone and laptop. I highly recommend this app especially to college students. Thank you devs for making such an outstanding program! üòÄüòÄüòÄ,
Its a great app and functionality is great BUT only when it works. Lately its been crashing regularly and using it has been a struggle to the point where its unusable. I'll edit my review once this persistent crashing issue is sorted.,
Nice and intuitive interface. Items/tasks are synced across devices. Great solution for organizing and filtering items. Also optional reminders are possible for more important items. No issues/bugs after 2 months of usage. Easy 5/5!,
"I am over the moon elated and happy with this app. I had to leave, more or less, another app that I had jury-rigged to accomplish To Do management. I'm glad that happened because it forced me to investigate apps like Todoist and I will not look back! Todist is simple yet exceedingly powerful. There's lots of collateral on YouTube and elsewhere in addition to the extensive help documents that come with the product to help you really customize it to your precise use case. I'm an avid, raving fan",
I have tried so many todo list applications and Todoist is my favourite todo list app and will be continued as so. Tackling daily tasks with Todoist is straightforward and easy. The integration with Google Calender is really amazing and I loved it as I were able to be more productive altoghether with Google Calender and managing tasks and todos with Todoist. Highly recommended for anyone.,
"This app came highly recommended from software dev friends. It boasts a remarkably intuitive user interface, stays in sync between desktop & mobile, and i've yet to hit any paywall bs; just simply the best to-do list application i've ever used.",
"Loving this app! To me, the best feature is the ability to break down complex tasks into smaller sub tasks, each of which can have their own due dates and priority. Makes it so much easier to make progress and complete projects. Thanks for such a great level of detail!",
I've been using it for just over a year now. it's apart of me now. thanks for upping the limit 300. breaking them up in to different projects is good and all but you lose two sync google calendar ability.,
"Keeps me on top of my tasks every day for the last 5 years. It's a great experience, works as advertised and intended, and I love the natural language features (e.g. ""Take out the trash every Mon 8pm starting Dec 1 until June 15""). One improvement would be to add duration so your integrated calendar could use this information better ‚Äì because ""today at 8pm"" in Todoist is a due date but for Google or Outlook calendar is a starting time for an 1-hour event.",
"Very solid task manager, really like the natural language method of entering tasks. It has the easiest method of creating recurring tasks I have found. Integration with Google Calendar is a plus. I like the clean interface.",
"I live my life by this app. I will forget EVERY thing I need to do if Todoist doesn't remind me that I need to do it. That is why I am so frustrated lately with this app. Every day I have many, many tasks that I need to know about. It seems recently that I get MAYBE 5% of them. At the end of the day I will check Todoist on my android device (Samsung Note 20 Ultra) but when I look at the list in Todoist, there are like 30 missed tasks marked in red but I NEVER got any notification.",
"I'm experiencing bugs when using widgets. The task will disappear and I can't add on it (No tasks match the current sorting options). To fix it, I need to remove and add the widget again. I'm using ""sorted by due date"", I'm not sure if it's the same with the other sorting options. I'm using Android 11.",
"Very poor sync between app and Google Calendar. Even though udates are getting pushed from Google Calendar (i.e. showing in browser version) but not received even after 30 minutes on app version. Developer please look into this. Edit: it is working well now, i am watching you üëÄ üòÇ",
"Love this app! Todoist, can you please add a feature for me? You can put it on Pro only. I really would like to be able to adjust what time a ""new day"" starts. Sometimes I'm up past midnight and complete some daily tasks after midnight, but it messes it all up because they don't show up for the next day because technically I've already completed them that day. I'd like the app to start a ""new day"" at, say, 3am instead of midnight. Can you add that please?",
"Todoist has allowed me to outsource my brain of all the chores, errands, and reminders that were constantly taking up real estate in my thoughts. I never have to worry about when I'm going to the grocery store, when to do laundry, or when my next oik change needs to be, etc. This app has allowed me to live a more efficient and intentional life. I recommend it to anyone that will listen to me.",
Todoist is legitimately my favorite to do list app I have ever used. It's what makes me aware of everything of what's going on or what i don't. I have a suggestion though. Can ya'll add a days/hours/mins away due feature where you can keep in track of how much time a task has left until due? That'll be great!,
"I have never had to write a list as I could always remember the order of the day. Now retired, I find I have a more divergent day and have too much to do to form a coherent picture. Enter Todoist. Just put everything that occurs to you in the inbox and sort the days/weeks jobs or each morning. prioritise, label - calls, emails.., order your day and tick off as you do. Set repeats, dates and times and reminders. Takes a bit of practice and discipline but it is excellent. Like a PA!",
"Suggestion: the repetitive task are not shown in the calendar for the entire duration. It would be nice if it is visible for the full duration (in the upcoming section, and also when scheduling a new task), so we know how my upcoming weeks look like",
"reply to developer: whatsapp continues to run in background and show notifications even after being closed. why are you unable to do that? .. original comment: I paid $4 for the reminders. However, reminders work only when the application is active. If you exit / shut-down the application, no reminders for you. Developer should design the application in such a way that it continues to run in background even when user exits it. I would like to have my money back unless this problem is rectified.",
I've been using todoist for the past 3 months to organized my uni life. Not going to lie but this apps has helped a lot in staying organized and stay focus on my prioritiesüôåüèª The interface is easy to adapt and use not only that it provides a lot of extension too such as Google calendar. Recommend everyone to try it out üòåüëåüèª‚ú®,
"overall great app. seeing if todoist could replace omnifocus which i have used for years. Pros - cross platform (windows, macOS, iOS, Android); Cons - can not set task durations, macOS users will that need to integrate with outlook will need some scripting to make work",
"Pretty exceptional. I wish the design choices between the mobile and the desktop platform were a little more consistent, but it's otherwise the one of the best todo-list apps out there.",
"Requires account to use.   I was just giving a simple reason why I didn't like it. But since your response indicates I don't have 10 seconds, then I'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand.  The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already.  Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that. That is what you need to understand, some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat. Downloaded ""Tasks: Todo List"" and been happy with it. Donated $1.99 to developer for making app for me and not their self.",
App is good esp. the language detection for date and time but the reminder / snooze function does not work properly. Needs to be persistent and not just move tasks to incomplete. I used a paid version. Now gone back to MS To Do.,
"Very disappointing considering how many people rave about this. The free version is too restrictive and paid version too expensive! It also has a kinda weird interface (in browser and app), which makes life difficult! Have deleted my account now.",
"Wow. WOW. And WOW! I've barely started. Just finished the getting started article and dang! The amount of effort put into this app and even the helpful personal tips along the way is fantastic! Just wanted to tip my hat to the individual(s) who put this together! Even more remarkably, it's free! HOW? This app just makes me wanna get things done lol Thanks so much!",
Great app! Easy to use. It has awesome challenges so you can compete with your friends. What I find interesting is that at the end of every year Todoist sends you an email showing you an overview of how your year went (what months were the most productive? What days and hours did you get the most done and what hours did you seem to move things around alot). It nice to know oh I'm more productive in the mornings etc...,
"A good option relative to what is out there. It's critical weakness is that it's complex to snooze items during the day, so you have difficulty doing zero inbox.  Update for programmer:  Thank you responding to my review.  One of the best features from Inbox was that you could snooze and email until a date AND time.  For example, I could have certain tasks appear in my inbox at 7AM for my morning's work, 1PM for what I tackle afternoons, and 5PM for home- and family-related stuff.  It was useful because I could schedule things to ping my attention at different times of day, and constant work to zero out my inbox.",
"[EDIT] Unfortunately since I wrote this review, Todoist has added pointless limitations and crippled the app - no more than 5 projects unless you pay *A LOT* to upgrade to professional. There's no middle ground. I think they've massively failed to understand their market. [OP] I was looking for the best alternative to Wunderlist. I think I found that in Todoist. In fact Todoist has some features I like ever better.",
"Absolutely love this app, I've been so organised since using this for the last 6 months. A feature I would love to see in future would be to have 'Tomorrow' as a default view. I primarily use 'Today' as it sorts my tasks into the projects I have set up and it's frustrating only being able to use upcoming to view my next day which mashes my tasks together.",
This app is really helpful to track all of tasks you have to get done. It has tons of different features to organize and remind you of you have to get done It has tremendously helped me manage my assignments in college.,
By far the best free management app. on parr with Familywall. Their website seems legit so I don't think my data is being siphoned to China. You do have to login but you can connect it to your Gmail so there is some security theater. I'm extremely skeptical when it comes to free apps but good job Todoist.,
"Todoist offers a number of useful features, so the concept is good. Widespread availability on platforms is also wonderful. Managing subtasks or mass edits can be a little annoying.",
"A very great app. However, just two things, and they are quite important. Tasks that are completed will not be shown if i dont choose to, and its very annoying tbh. The other thing is that i cant track down the completed tasks by searching the tags but only those incompleted, so what is the point of adding them tags into those tasks, bruh... Hence only three stars. And i noticed that there are so many cmts here complaining about the first thing i complained about.",
"Really good app, but not working correctly with Google Assistant is a real hindrance. I will rate it higher when that is fixed. Not just me, but multiple people saying they can't get it to work either.",
Really wish there was a way to make the alerts a little more consistent and powerful. Seems like they always get subdued. I've tried messing with the setting in-phone. Am I missing something? Android user.,
"I use it implement a semy understood GTD method. The app is quite flexible, and I thing that quite a few different methods could be implemented using it. It has tags, due dates, different levels of priority, and projects. All customizable. And then you could set yor own custom rules, ie filters, that let you create your own ""views"" of your tasks, giving you a lot of flexibility. This enables you to make different logical connections beetween the tasks at the same time.",
"Updating for 2020-still the most important app I use. It's been life-changing. ---- Todoist is the most important app I use. It's a tremendous way to keep track of professional and personal projects and tasks, make lists (weekly menu, shopping lists), collaborate at work, and keep track of my kids' responsibilities. Doist is an ethical, bootstrapped company with a customer-centric vision and a regular release schedule. If I could marry Todoist, you know I would.",
"I use this app everyday for years and really like it, but nowadays it is full of bugs, even simple things cannot be done without bugs. In the last couple of months the app has become noticeably worse due to bugs.",
"While I've only been using Todoist for less than a week I can honestly, with no exaggeration say that it is changing my working life. I am a teacher and organisation is key to teaching... I have no organisational skills at all. This app genuinely helps me keep on top of my work and I'm finding I am no longer falling behind on my work, no longer stressed when I drive home and feel so much better and calmer about my job - I can actually enjoy it! Because it is the best! Thank you Todoist!",
"The February 8th release is completely broken. Will not sync. If you try to update a task it will crash. It seems as if there was no testing done on this! And now five days later, still no fix. If you have not upgraded don't.",
So I am a little frustrated that I can't actually give you money. I need the reminders for this app to be worth it for me and I can't upgrade because it won't let me upgrade in the app and when it tells me to go to the website it just force opens the app every time I log in. Not a great way to make profit. I'm going to continue to use it but the lack of reminders makes it less than appealing.,
"One of the best Organizing app. The UI very simple and easy to understand , you can track, note, and also you get a bunch of template for your work flow. 100% Recommend who is looking for a to-do list or Note taking",
"Been Pro user for more than a year. Very nice UI, clean interface, tags, however requires subscription for reminders, which I consider basic functionally. Considering this, there are better free alternatives.",
Super useful app for productivity. Loved it,
"Full options has no buy option just yet ANOTHER subscription endlessly that I can't really afford anyway that'll screw with my bank account someday and I'll have to fight to end and regret overall. Gee thanks... pass on that. I'll go spend my money on a paper planner that won't be an endless list of auto transactions trying to break me. I'm done with this type of thing, seriously. I can't take anymore.",
I used other to-do list apps before but this one is just perfect. I love google calendar integration.,
"Only worth it now if you want to pay. I used to use todoist for everything, work, chores, planning my wedding, all of it. I recently returned to it and found my free account limited to 5 projects. This has completely hamstrung the utility of this app and I will be uninstalling it after years of dedicated use and switching to one of the dozens of free project management alternatives.",
"This app is good. But when i added a widget to the screen, at times it doesnt work properly. I have to go to the app again and add or cancel my finished tasks.",
I use it everyday with the desktop app. it works great to quickly capture tasks before I forget them. The comments and attachments feature available as a paid account is super useful. Customer service is fast to reply to reported bugs and so friendly.,
"This is about as good as apps get. The app is powerful but not overcomplicated. It's beautiful, intuitive, fast, reliable, and customizable. Really don't have anything negative to say! Thanks for a great app, devs!",
"I feel like I've spent my entire adult life looking for a to do system that works the same way my brain does, so it's hard to overstate how relieving it is to have found Todoist. When I hit the limitations of the a free account, subscribing was an absolute no brainer. Please, please, please don't sell this app to a big company to screw up!!",
"I couldn't work out how to use this app and decided to stick to my conventional hand written to do list and I uninstalled this app. However, I still keep getting 'reminders' about things I never even put in myself (they seemed to be there, maybe as examples?, when I first installed the app). I find this really annoying. How can this even happen!",
"Can't use with VPN. I practice Information Security and prefer to use a VPN whenever I can. I use 2 Norton & NordVPN (not of course at the same time). In both usage cases, when my VPN is activated it would say there is no connection. I have even tried different servers. Is there a reason that VPNs are a problem for your service? How is your data management & security? Does your company view people's data? How do you keep others from being to steal others data, because username & passcodes...",
App was fine until last update now I can't edit tasks or figure out how anything works and I had to delete a ton of projects to make room for an invite that was auto rejected and user had to resend. There doesn't even seem to be a built in help feature,
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling.",
Great app even without the premium version. However would be nice if you could see the completed tasks checked off or crossed off you did that day or the last two days or the last 5 days. I think that would really keep you even more organized,
"dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free.",
"It's a good, simple to use app. My only input for improvements would be it's too easy for an item to be deleted and there is no way that I can tell to undo the action or recover the item. Otherwise, it suits my needs well!",
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit.",
"Seems pretty good initially. But i cant get the adding task by voice to work anymore. Google Assist keeps taking me to other apps instead of Todoist. It keeps adding items to some kind of internal shopping list. Update - I contacted support. They sent email with instructions on linking Todoist to GA. Works but too many questions now. Like others reviewers,, I just want to say. ""OKG... Add task to go to store"" and be done, or ""Ok,Anything else?""... ""no"". Too much dialog now. Used to work this way?",
I was very pleased with Todoist app for quite some time (I am paid /premium member) but since last 2-3 days ago the app stopped working correctly : push notifications stopped working and I am not getting push notification reminders on my android phone anymore. Please fix this bug as this is the only reason I need app at all. Thanks üôè,
I used to have a separate to-do list and scheduled items into my calendar manually. This app has streamlined that wonderfully. The integration with Google calendar and Gmail is seamless and so useful. Fantastic little app!,
Useful once you get your head around how it works. The way it's set up when you first get the app is confusing to understand. It would be better to have a blank canvas and be guided from there. However once you figure it all out it's very useful.,
"This app would be better if it gave you the ability to repeat tasks. Most of my tasks need to be completed monthly, but it doesn't have the option to make a task repeat. I don't want to waste my time having to schedule the same task for every single month.",
"My husband set it up so we can tell Google to add to our shopping list, as a project. It's great in the kitchen, though a little inconvenient to add through all the taps on the phone.",
"I am coming from Wunderlist and I am slowly adjusting to this app. There are several things on that app that are not on Todoist. I wish I could copy repeated tasks to the next week instead of having to retype it. I also would like to be able to see my finished tasks for the week. Completed tasks disappear and are not in the completed tasks (unless it is a sub task). I forget whether I did things or not, hence the reason I need an app like this!",
"Great tool. Easy to use so that you don't give up using it out of frustration. Just naturally type to add a task. Super cool. Don't need any of the premium features, so I enjoy what they offer for free.",
"√â excelente! O √∫nico por√©m, √© o reminder √© s√≥ liberado com assinatura. Sugest√£o, criar um ""Todoist premium"" com essas features liberadas apenas para o usu√°rio (sem o modelo de assinatura), eu pagaria por isso! ------ It is excellent! The only thing, however, is that the reminder is only released with subscription. Suggestion, create a ""Todoist premium"" with some features released only to a single user (without the subscription model), I would pay for it!",
"Very nice app with a lot of integrations which makes it very comfortable to use. Although I think some features are missing, e g. Grouping by project in a filtered view",
I like todoist a lot. I would love to see one feature to track my productivity better: To be able to start a pomodoro for any particular task. This way I can track the amount of time I spend on each task and can improve my planning as a whole.,
"Very handy app! :) When you are on the go and have random moments of reminder of your to-do lists, its very handy to just go on this app on your phone and start listing take, reminders, goals. Try it and you'll love it!",
"Well designed app, just wish it had some more flexibility for assigning dates and responsibilities. I also haven't been very successful at using the notification function.",
Easy to use and helps to track my list of things to do each day. I like that I can rearrange items to future days and prioritize them. Would be nice to be able to review past items but it is okay since it's a free app.,
I love the fact that I can integrate my work and personal todolist through this app. I have a work phone that doesn't allow calendar integration with Google calendar. Todoist wonderfully combines my todolist from work and home and plots it on my calendar for work as well as my Google calendar making life much organized.,
"Easy to use and really helps me with executive dysfunction and memory issues from ADHD. I do wish it would give me reminders more than once a day, but I suspect there's a setting for that and I just haven't found it yet.",
"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2.",
"Really like this app, using the free app. Easy to organise, you can set time and dates for when projects need to be completed. In a project you can add a sub project and sub task too. Very handy. You can share your whole project with someone and even tag them in a specific task should you be splitting a project up. The tabs for today and tomorrow are also very uselful as it is a quick reminder to what needs to be completed on those days. You can even set priorities to tasks on urgency. Great app",
"This üëè app üëè is üëè amazing! Very clean design, cross platform stuff sync is extremely quick - checking off someone on my phone instantly checks it off on my Mac. Dark Mode is also present for the free version!!!!!!",
"I've only been using this app for a few days, but am already noticing how helpful it is. I was endlessly writing lists on scrapes of paper and getting in a mess. This is really helping streamline my workflow.",
"New problem The App is not working at all right now, keeps loading and show nothing.. Old problem The changes made on PC are not showing in the phone app... But if i add something in the phone i can see it in the PC... What is going on? Fix this please (I contact support by website, still not fixed) ( at todays date July 2, i just check and there is no updates available for my device)",
"Great themes, simple UI, and has so many features out of the box! Most todo apps only give you access to a couple of projects or a few tasks before they pay wall you. This app is amazing I would recommend to anyone",
"After the last update ""view all"" display changed from by project to by due date and messed up my entire view. No option to change it back..... Im done with this app, they keep changing things everytime it updates and the changes are annoyances not improvements.",
"How did the rating get so high when even reminders need to pay a premium? If it was good then I would'nt mind doing a free trial, but I was out the moment there is not even reminder, so basic of to-do lists, in free version. Just doesnt make sense.",
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!,
"This app has the potential to change your life for the better. Tasks become much less stressing once you note them down, and feels rewarding to tick them off. The user interface is extremely well thought-out. I simply love it and want to thank the people involved.",
"By far my favorite productivity app. Very well thought-out, but also intuitive to use. Great job guys. The only enhancement I can suggest is adding the capability to measure streaks for the reccuring tasks.",
"Newest update nerfs the widget so you can't utilize as much functionality to it. The main app also features the annoying swipe to select feature now. The previous click to select was fine and this new change doesn't add anything, only creates a new barrier of frustration.",
"Free version so far and it helps me stay organized with the Getting Things Done approach. Reminders, Labels and File Attachments are a Premium feature though. Might actually upgrade, it's that good!",
"Exactly what I've been looking for to manage my personal projects and to do lists. After trying out the free version, I upgraded to paid immediately. It's just the right price with easy-to-use features on mobile and web versions. Not sure how managing team software projects would work on it--we're satisfied with Jira and Rally for those.",
This app revolutionized how I keep track of daily tasks and HW assignments. I can even set reminders to look at certain Email in certain days. This app helped me to go from being an average C-/ D student to an A/ A+ student. This app really helps me to prioritize what assignments need to be done first and it helps me organize what assignments go into what class. Excellent job on the App,
"I use this at home, at work, and on my phone. I have created templates and checklists that have already been useful. I work in healthcare, and I'm keeping up with changing insurance requirements better than ever! It works beautifully with the GTD method.",
"I dislike that I must pay to use comments, and I dislike that there is no way to add a description to the task. I understand that in regards to the former that you need to make money, but the latter issue makes it clunky if one has a long and complicated task with resources one must past links to in. But I do appreciate the app and am impressed with how consistently you stay on top of squashing bugs. Keep it up! Can't wait to see kanban implemented!",
Couldn't live without it. On all platforms always at hand. Simple enough to be intuitive. Advanced enough to offer all I need (I have Premium). Google calendar 2way sync stellar! Absolutely love Todoist.,
Very customizable and powerful with filters. Missing start date and some planning ability due to this. Awesome that it is on every platform I need due to web interface that is excellent.,
I love Todoist but it frustrates me that tapping a project in the sidebar doesn't show me all of the sub-projects and tasks like it does on the desktop app. Would save me a lot of time navigating the app.,
"Useful for someone with ADHD who needs a way of making prioritized lists but has a hard time remembering where said list is, what else I need to do, etc. Great shortcuts built in to set up future lists and prioritize those as well.",
"No way to use without login. I'm tired of all my apps trying to tie in with everything else. Just let me have a no-login option with the data residing purely on my phone. Had this installed for roughly 30 seconds, so I can't comment on the functionality.",
"Reminders are a ""premium feature"" apparently. Pretty much renders it useless for me, and $3/month is a lot to pay for something that is free elsewhere. Shame, it's a nice app, but only lasted 5 minutes for this reason. 2* given as it's at least easy to delete your account.",
"This is a loser. Upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial, no option in the app to return to free option. And I'm maxed out on tasks ON the premium. Will delete before I pay for premium. Prior review: Migrated from Wunderlist seamlessly. Much more cumbersome compared to Wunderlist.",
Honestly I've tried tons of apps to aid in productivity. This is the one I always come back to. Intuitive and able to view my list from all sorts of devices are great.,
"Amazing productivity app. But u 've to purchase the premium version to get reminders features, other then that. Really good, simple, fast, gets the job done. By being not in my face with reminders all time.",
"Moved here from Wunderlist, after trying other apps. This is so clean and easy to use and does everything I needed and more. My fiance and I can now both keep track of the grocery list! (So glad it has the ability to share with others)",
"of all the task apps I've tried over the years, Todoist has been the most reliable, fastest, useful. it is my only task tracker for personal and business. the Todoist team is responsive and constantly improving the app.",
"I LOVE TODOIST SOOO MUCH! I swear to God, I'm on top of everything and passing all my classes only thanks to it. I highly recommend this app if you're a student and need to plan your assignments and stuff. Setting reminders sadly does require premium, but I recommend it because it unlocks so many other benefits (larger file uploads, increased project limit, etc). Other cool things this app has is a Wear OS companion app that's actually useful (*cough Any Do cough*) and a karma system!",
"Today I was working with my tasks, writing a comment to one of them. I wrote about an hour, my thoughts, feelings, it was a list of 10+ different items. But after another cup of coffee I accidentally pressed Esc on my keyboard - this closed popup with the task and its comment. I didn't save it.. I thought all my writing got lost.. But thanks to all Todoist team - I reopened the task and comment was there, safe and sound. Thank you very much!! The BEST APP EVER!!!",
"Overall it met my expectation but do hit a bug. When I try to sort with labels, the app will crash. Cannot reopen until I use the chrome extension in my desktop to remove the sort before it opens again.",
"Don't waste your money! Instead, to get a free trial you have to select business even if you aren't a business. Then you can still experience the miserable support experience of 6 days of radio silence (and it has now been 48 Hours of radio silence on my urgent ticket). The app/system/api is fairly good, but I would expect better bug support if they claim to have a business or even premium plan.",
"Overall, very good app. But the latest update made one thing almost impossible - moving a task from project to project. I can't find a way to do that neither from task list nor from task details view. It makes my workflow almost unusable :(",
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day.",
"Looks good, but is for me worthless without notifications. And then 3-4 $ per month in order to activate notifications is way too much. Maybe 1 $ could have been worth in order to move away from Microsoft's free TODO app.",
"Doesn't allow multiple calendars to be synced, making it useless if you're someone that wants to use this for work and personal. Also no proper calendar view. Anydo does both of these things.",
It's good. Reliable and fast sync across platforms. Slightly annoying they got rid of the project drop down on quick task entry as using the # button is annoying on a mac. But will let it slide as rest of app is so good.,
Loved this app until the pop up to install the widget started appearing all the time! I can't get rid of it and it's destroying my experience. I can't make a list without it appearing 2-3 times,
"I love this app so much. It offers a lot of features yet the file size of this app is minimal. The only problem I have with this app is when I try to edit my account name, it only concatenates my input from my previous name, and I just see white background in input and also without blinking text cursor. Please fix this and I'll rate it 5 stars for sure.",
"Some pieces are a bit less than intuitive, some scheduling features are better on the desktop app, and a buy forever option would be really cool. Otherwise no complaints.",
"*EDIT seems to be more stable now, thanks! Been working great but now a bit unstable, crashes after adding tasks from quick access. Crashes randomly in the app. Good phone so I don't believe its that. Cleared cache too.",
the best app I've found for implementing David Allen's system for Getting Things Done!,
"This is my all time favorite calendar app. The amount of customizability along wih the smoothness of the app is great. I use this for mainly for school work, as well as other random reminders and it really helps.",
"Great app. I have the premium app for more than 1 year. But there is a bug that hasn't changed. If you click the share button to social media and immediately cancel it, you are going still to get the rewards",
The best thing about this app is that it lets plan your your to do list not only for present but also for future. And the way it show the weekly calendar in its upcoming is just amazing. And it also sort the task according to priority and time assigned.,
It's a great app ive been using for a while! but only 4 stars cuz I'm not loving the new update with the assignee feature. I don't like that there are question marks all over the place just because I can't assign tasks in my private projects :(,
"I switched from Microsoft ToDo because it had problems with app-website sync. I like this app design, description field on todo item, sub-items design and it worked well so far (while I was migrating manually my tasks from previous app).",
"Awesome! i wish u add a "" Push a day forward/ backward"" option for tasks with date , like when i have and emergency and i can't do my tasks instead of rescheduling, i want to push the whole week a day or 2 with the same days order , or when i finish my tasks earlier than expected i want to bring the whole calendar a day or 2 earlier instead of doing this manually.",
Pretty good. I use it as daily reflection to the task I have accomplish for the day.,
"this app helps me a lot! I can't even describe what I'm feeling right now :"") just wanna say thank you very much for creating this app! well this app deserves more than 5 stars tho LOL I can download it on my laptop also and it will sync by itself if u use the same account! but I have one suggestion for making kind of daily/weekly schedule with no fee, that would be really great! :D thanks a million!",
"I REALLY Hate that every time I reach my goal the app pops up and asks if I want to share it. No I don't and no one cares if I accomplished my tasks it is over sharing. I do like having a shared family chore list. Overall the app is good I get frustrated by the forced social/share aspect I am slightly annoyed by ""game-ifcation"" but I can avoid that by staying in perpetual vacation mode.",
Honestly it's so great and for free too. never felt so productive. wished they made reminds free but the scalability makes up for it. either on my phone or chrome or desktop I'm always see what I need to have done!,
Wonderful native app of an excellent service. I am very glad that added dark mode. Would've preferred of there was some options to adjust the gesture but it's manageable and easy to use.,
"hands down best task management app. easy to use platform, intuitive motions, lightweight on flashy heavyweight on functionality. the karma incentive really surprised me how effectively it helps me want to stay on track.",
"This app is perfect! Simple to use and full featured. Let's you organize your ToDo's tasks into Projects, Subjects within the Project, and even sub-tasks within the tasks. Fantastic tool for logical thinkers. If you are a random thinker like my wife, she just lumps everything in one list, then uses labels to sort things out. Love that it also does Kanban board too.",
"Update: The issue was fixed within a few days. Thank you for quickly addressing the problem. Please fix the bug in the app. As of 4/8/22, it has been crashing on both my phone and tablet.",
Really enjoy this app! If you like making to do lists this is simply perfect for you. I'm on the standard one and it's v good. I'm toying with paying for the premium features so everything is integrated with my calendar and I can have reminders which I think I'll love,
"I have tried and used so many task management apps over the years but I am now happy I have found the best. As long as it continues to perform and does not get bought out by Microsoft or someone else who ruins it, I will not be changing!",
"The UI looks great. Love the dark theme. Problem is I downloaded this app because it was advertising watch compatibility in the pictures but the app is nowhere to be found on my Galaxy Watch Active, which was the only reason I chose this specific app.",
"The app is great but can be very limited. Having to pay monthly just to get certain features. You can't set reminders unless u pay. Only 5 projects are allowed, no labels unless u pay. Still pretty good tho",
Literally everything that i ever need in a todolist app... the minimalistic design and AMAZING user interface is soo user-friendly and helpful to stay organised and plan my days accordingly. Honestly this has been nothing short of a life changer for me.,
"Without a doubt the best app for creating to-do lists and get things accomplished. From work to personal life, this app has allowed for seamless task creation, completion and reminders. You can even tie into your outlook and gmail, use to create simple follow up process. Thanks ToDoist, you guys rock!",
Having a free ToDo App without a reminder functionality is as good as having a stopwatch app that doesn't count. What's the point if it's gatelocked behind a premium? Might as well have released the app as paid. This is considering other apps have this for free,
"It's fairly useful! Been using it for a month, it's easy to reschedule tasks and the emails help remind me of things I had planned. I can also jot down spur of the moment things that arise.",
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.,
"Almost uninstalled this apps since there's shortcomings like no comments & tags features for the free version, but then suddenly it's available for the free version, thankyou! this is very useful for to-do list apps I can't describe it enough.",
"I have used the premium version of this task manager for several years. Cross-platform functionality is a must and it integrates well with several other programs (email, calendar, IFTTT). Great for those using GTD methodology. Try the free (limited) version, then upgrade for full capabilities.",
"This is a wonderful app, I love the simplicity and intuitiveness - it helps me reduce stress from the many things I need to do and instead allows me to focus and get more things done overall!",
"I have been looking for an app that mimics my paper journal. This is it! I am still learning but this is great. I can do everything in the app that I do I'm my journal and then some. I don't have to look for pens and stickers or washi tape. I can decorate in this app with just a few clicks. I would defenatly recommend this to anyone who wants a journal, to do list and more with just one app.",
"Nice app for daily todo tasks. Like the way we can organize projects, tasks, priority and label. Remainder in free version would have great but no complains as it does the todo task management way better than other apps. Kudos to the team!",
"Using it since years to manage both personal and professional space. Happy with it but can be improved. Overall, the best app in the market for managing tasks and much more. Cheers.",
"Very easy to use, and very flexible for however you use todoist. I fully recommend it, I now use todoist to organise all sorts of things. I particularly appreciate having task reminders as notifications.",
"I use the free version and it does enough for me to keep using it. The premium features don't seem aggressively sold, but they do sit there taunting you and they do seem useful.",
To do lists with reminders is all it does‚Ä¶ But it works flawlessly and integrates with desktop app in real time. Definitely the best to do list out there‚Ä¶ Because I've tried a ton of them.,
loving a super simple to do list on my phone screen. widget is simple to add to and check off completed tasks. I've been using the free version for a couple of weeks and have eliminated the scraps of paper in my pockets,
Love the app. Easy to add tasks and nice simple display across my phone and lappie. The desktop app took a hotkey though which I often use in another app and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it to another one.,
"Hard to find option to create recurring tasks, without those it's a no go, paid notifications/reminder. Google calendar offer those for free with pc and mobile interfaces Still recurring tasks are hard to find, additionally I would need to have recurring tasks that expire after X occurrences",
Haven't used it for very long but I like the format. I've created several projects in order to organize thoughts/ideas and future tasks. Nice to have an easy way to dump out the brain every now and then.,
"Great ux/ui, super easy to put a new task, and get your day organized. Another cool thing is that you can connect all your devices and also integrate your Google calendar. Also love the little hiden shortcuts in the web version. Keep up the good work and if you need more feedback would be happy to share üòâ",
The only reason it is not a 5 star is because of some little discomforts. When a list is sorted I think the writing custom sorted is unnecessary or could be done in a mor3 appealing way. And it is my earnest request you guys make a calendar app or have an in build calendar in todoist. I want to plan stuff here and manage my tasks as well.,
Excellent app to keep my tasks in check. Only gripe is that the widget doesn't use the dark theme when I toggle dark theme system wide leaving this one single widget in light mode. Hope it gets fixed soon.,
It's a great app. Easy to use and load to-do list. Only challenge is you might miss the the notification. If they can just add sound to notifications. Otherwise I am enjoying the app,
"So far, so good! I am just learning and have adhd; it seems user-friendly enough to benefit from immediately, while offering more complex options when I'm ready. I'm looking forward to getting better at using it.",
This app needs a calendar view. Bonus points if you could incorporate a merge option with my google calendar. I'm a visual person so a straight up list doesnt do much for me.,
"i am a total chaotic mess and although pretty reluctant at first, this app changed my life!! its easy, friendly, helpful, quick, intuitive and teaches me to organise my life and my projects! thanks to all at todoist!",
"Migrated from Wunderlist and although it's still early days, it seems like a good alternative, although some key features are available only for the premium version. I might give that a go and report back.",
"Does great. Though I wish they added more features like having a brain dump specific list where you can store ideas for the future. You can do this in projects but I didn't want to mix that in with projects that already have an identity. Otherwise, does exactly as it should.",
Great app for sharing lists and keeping organized. Need improvement on deleting projects when done while using app. So far I have had to log in on the computer and delete there. That's annoying.,
"I organize all my life with it. I particularly love the keywords to set the priority, the categorie and the due date of each task. Love the ""slide"" feature to easily check or postpone a task. This is the best tasks organizer on Android.",
"Love the app, but I'm running into an issue where I try to show completed tasks in a project and it says there aren't any. This issue is fixed by going onto desktop and doing the same thing, but I'd like to see it fixed in the app.",
"The app was looking awesome until.....One of the most important parts of this app for me is ""reminders"". After installing the app, it was a bummer to discover ""reminders"" are only available in the paid version. Bait & Switch.",
"What I really liked (and what prompted this review) is how good the natural language support is - I can easily type 'stop Netflix subscription 28 days from now' and Todoist sets it as a task for 28 days later, without me having to figure out these small, time-consuming, decision-intensive details myself.",
"Have been using this app for over a year now and use it for pretty much everything. I use it to manage things for my students, my research at uni, general life commitments, work at uni. The education discount is amazing for the premium version!",
Amazing app. It's good to have something to keep me productive. As bad as it saunds me being lazy it helps me to keep on top of everything I'm planning out to do. I recommend to give it a shot since for chaotic people like myself it can do wanders just if you are willing to make first effort to work on your goals. Its just first week for me so don't want to prize it to much but I feel that difference already.,
Love this app. I was addicted to another to do app and it was very difficult to make the switch. The final push was Todoist's excellent 2 way sync with Google calendar. This has made me significanly more productive from day one with this app. Love it!!,
Todoist has 1 big flaw that really prevents me to use it well: if you schedule a task to be repeated daily and do it few minutes after midnight it will skip a day. Overdue tasks that are completed should add the repeat time to the previous date not be reset to the day they are marked compete!!,
"The best to-do app imo. Free version is more than enough for most users, sort tasks by date, priority or projects, get reminders, overall great. Super easy to sync tasks between devices.",
"This app is what has kept me sane and successful through college and grad school. It's annoying how it shows features that are only available in Premium, but the free version has everything you could need",
"easy to use and organise to do list in a variety of categories. it allows for parent and child categories, support priority assigment (1-4) my only qualm is that sometimes i work past midnight and if i check off daily goals of the previous day, they do not reload into the current. if there is a setting that allows checking off tasks retroactively, or one that locks daily tasks to their specific day it would be helpful and 5-stars",
"I wish widget would have a very compact design, just a list of tasks, nothing more -- no menu bar, no headers, etc. As for me, the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised.",
"It does what I need when I need it and it provides me with in information I require to be more efficient. Plus it is linked to Alexa so it it easy to add tasks or even groceries to my lust. It's a win, win!",
"it was easy to use the first few days, but now it's only adding everyday things (like feeding my dogs) to my list every other day, and not letting me fix it. it also doesn't send notifications so in order to remember my todo list I have to remember to open an app with my todo list.",
"PROBLEM WITH NEW UPDATE. Since the latest update, the app keeps crashing everytime I try to expand a task's subtasks using the built in ""down arrow"" button on the right side of the screen. PLEASE FIX.",
"The app is super buggy for Android. Can't make new tasks (the ""arrow/send"" button doesn't work) & existing tasks cannot be changed either. In summary, the Android app is completely unusable right now for me.",
"Overall this is an amazing app. I have a suggestion though, google calendar has two types of notifications. Default notification, default notification for full day event. Todoist is currently only taking default notification in account when google calendar integration is setup. In todoist, an event with only date should be considered as full day event and when syncing full day notification setting should be applied. If an event has date too, default event notification setting should be used.",
Really inconvenient. Sometimes people just want to make a to do list with out a date. This app is not helpful when it deletes what you didn't get done on a certain date. Really inconvenient,
This app is simply amazing. It's so easy to use and you can synchronize it with yohr pc and phone and it just works great. How longer I use the app how more I begin to wonder how it is possible that this app is free. I'm absolutely stunned by the possibilities of this app. 10/10 would definitely recommend this app to everyone!,
"Quick and fairly intuitive to use. Due dates for recurring tasks can be a little finicky. No built in way to review completion stats of recurring tasks, but it can be done using ifttt.",
**Edit** After seeing some wrinkles ironed out I cannot say enough good things about this app. It has helped tremendously to implement the Getting Things Done method. The fee is not outrageous and worth the price. The customer service is also fairly responsive as well!,
5 Star App let down by 1 Star Pricing. For basic users like me it's simply not worth ¬£4 a month subscription to add the Reminders feature I need and a bunch of other features I'll never use. Would happily pay a one-off ¬£4 fee to add reminders.... but went back to Google Tasks which is nearly as good and free.,
"absolutely amazing app, 100% free, and no ads. literally only improvement i want is ability to add reminders for the whole month, 7 days isn't good enough. Otherwise, well done guys!! Perfect",
I made a resolution to set better habits to steward my time and researched some options. I found this through Tim Challies' recommendation from the book Do More Better & productivity worksheet. He also provided some helpful tips to setting up different tasks under projects and categorizing the roles/responsibilities you have in your life (which is ever changing). I really like that I can set certain tasks to repeat daily or weekly and see the next 7 days ahead to plan out my day/week.,
"Todoist is a part of my memory now. As a single parent of two-kids with a full time job I don't know how I survived before. Now I dump everything I need to do on Todoist and don't bother trying to remember: It does the job for me. I have tons of things to do from kid's school related things to the house and health appointments, I keep everything there. I never miss anything. I strongly recommend to anyone with a lot of things to do (who doesn't nowadays:)",
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.,
"4 year full time user says, ""go elsewhere."" The most recent update has destroyed this app. You can only have a maximum of 5 projects or you have to pay for 300. It's unuseuable with such a low number of projects. You're forced into paying if you want to use the app. I've used this service for years and have really become accustomed to it. I'm very disappointed I have to start the process of finding a new app to use.",
ToDoist is awesome. Probably the thing that makes it stand out is it's natural language recognition. But I also love it's simple design yet wide range of customiziability options.,
"Not at all intuitive, on first impression. The brief tutorial suggests that you need to start by adding a project, but I can't see a way to do this. I added a task, but this then disappeared. No idea how this app works or how it is supposed to help with my life. Uninstalled.",
"I love this, I do wish some more features were free, but regardless it's fantastic either way. Would highly recommend it even if you're looking for a free systematic organizer.",
"love it, and I would buy a premium version for one price but im not interested in anymore monthly payment or yearly payments so ill stick with the free version. it's simple and does exactly what I need it to do.",
"Great app for productivity. Simple, great UI, easy to navigate and easy to use. I like it a lot and it helps me get stuff done efficiently without forgetting stuff as a student with a part time job.",
"It is the perfect solution for someone who has all kinds of proje ts on the go and is in need of a way to keep organized! It is fast, easy, and customizable! Very useful!",
"App keeps crashing after trying to complete 1 task. Not happy. I emailed as per app request. Got a reply telling me not to email, don't bother as that's not how to contact them. My app is still crashing. I've cancelled my membership subscription ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
"This app used to be perfect until they started collapsing all the tasks into one notification. This makes it too easy to ignore, severely limiting the usefulness of the app. Edit: No I'm not going to submit a ticket. Do the work yourself or pay me to do it.",
"I want to 4 stars this and say ""because there's still a room for improvement"" but this app is the best out of all the todo apps I downloaded. I became more organize in my works and it's super rewarding because I can see the task that I completed, it's motivating me to do more works and click more in this app lol. Thank youu, this is so much better. I still have lots of work, gotta goo!!~",
"it's a good app and easy to use, but when I try to reorder and arrange a list, it goes back to the order it was in before I tried to reorder it. in short, reordering lists doesn't work.",
"I've used many apps for to-do lists and for now this is the best of them. I would love to use it also as some sort of calendar- not only for tasks but also for events (things I won't have to check off). I'm not sure if this is a to-do list app, but maybe other users would love this feature too^^.",
"An AMAZING productivity app that simplifies my running of multiple orgs. I no longer have to remind people, follow up to know if things got done, worry that they didn't get the word, etc. Very easy & user friendly. New users don't need training...maybe like 2 minutes.",
"What's a pity. Heaving ADHD I really need an app like this as I need to be reminded daily, every day, if my listening of things to do. With great expectations I signed up and installed the android app. BOOM, I make a to do list and want to set a reminder but, you need to pay for a subscription to get audio notifications. I live in Africa, unemployed and living of so little money it will scare people in first world countries.",
"I went through all the stuff to link this to my Google Assistant, but it doesn't work right. I can get it to add a task, supposedly, but when I tell it to read my tasks it says I have no tasks for today and doesn't give me any way to list the complete set of tasks, the ones I just added. This is worthless.",
"Great at identifying. tracking, and completing tasks. Not perfect, but better than the alternatives I have tried. and continually improved.",
"Pros : no annoying adds, sync across all devices, enough projects in free version. Cons: inerface logic is not common - you have to get used to it, especially for lists, price - 3‚Ç¨ month.",
"Todoist is my go-to task mgt app. It complements my physical planner nicely and enables me to execute well on a daily basis. Great UI, stays sync'd across devices, and dead simple with all the right features.",
"I was facing a problem that my reminder never pop out at notification bar when it's time. I have send a few message to support team regarding this problem. But no one reply, just a member who call David, he sent me a welcome message. Then I replied him with my problem as well. He did not reply too. I have just paid for 1 year package, now I hope I can get my refund.",
"I like this app and this app is very usefull for me but when i purchased premium package for one year , and try to use reminder service that is not working properly ...i tried youtube to resolve my problem but my reminders not give me notification.... Then i sent an email to todoist team and they give me tickect no 408257, but still there is no response from todoist ... So please resolve my problem. I want to use this app and doesnt want to switch to other. app is good for me so i give you 5 star",
Wish you could set reminders for upcoming tasks instead of only seeing the task appear on its due date,
"Simple, intuitive, feature rich. Even the free version is more than enough for my personal needs. Collaboration will need extra feature in the paid version.",
free version was awesome until it wouldn't let me delete my tasks I no longer wanted & forced me to click finished on tasks I didn't finish. all because they wouldn't delete. I get email notifications too telling me I have unfinished tasks which is great & all but it's annoying when it's for tasks I tried to delete.,
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality.",
"I'm a person who loves a paper checklist, but my list is so long that the paper was becoming unruly. I love Todoist and how I can track all my to-dos in one place. I even have a ""waiting for"" list which allows me to follow-up on things I have delegated or requested. When I ""need"" paper, I just print my list. I like how I can search my lists and add snips and comments; I dont have to search through email. Highly recommend!",
"Crashing frequently when interacting with ""boards"" or items that were recently moved. Other than that I think the app is pretty well put together.",
"Great App. Well organized and User friendly UI. Although, monthly subscription is a bit much, I'd rather pay full price for the whole app and get all the features it offers.",
"I really like that you get notified after a few days if you forget to complete something, both on your email and phone. Although I haven't tried other to-do list apps, this one works great so far and I definitely recommend it :)",
"Do you love spam email and push notifications on an app that harvests your data? Try this!! You'll get multiple emails and notifications daily. Go ahead and type in ""buy ___ ' and see what happens to your adds. Took this spyware, malware, piece of junk ""list app"" off my device",
I have enjoyed using the app. I like that you can plan to do something and it's tossed into the void or tossed into a bucket for planning later I wish I could hide buttons related to premium features but once you get used to what is what you can avoid them,
Best app I have ever downloaded and well worth the $36 for premium. Every aspect of my life is organized now and there is no more stress... no more constant feeling that I'm forgetting something... amazing tutorial and super easy to use! Thank you to those that have contributed to the development of this wonderful app!!!!,
"Guys, please make it harder to accidentally 'finish' tasks cause it's getting really annoying. Anyway, amazing app, have been using it for a long time and I feel like it's impact on my life has been immense.",
"I think its a great app, although I do have one suggestion. After completing a task, especially for the day, maybe it would be more motivating to cross it out and keep it there, so that one could see how many tasks they have completed till then and how much they have left.",
"True to its claim! This all-in-one app is definitely a productivity booster (unlike other mainstream productivity apps I've tried.) ;) Easy to use, great interface, very rewarding (esp. when you see your karma level goes up).",
"Cool and descent. Just wish to show completed things automatically. Each time i need to look at them Also while showing completed things, display it as recent first 1. To do 2. Completed recent 3. Past complete .. .. Like wise",
Best task management app and ive tried them all. I keep coming back to Todoist because its flexible enough without being too overwhelming. The app is constantly getting updates and improvements.,
"I have been using Todoist for about 5 years now on Android, iPhone, the iPad, & MacOS. All work well and sync seamlessly. I love the simplicity and the ability to swipe away completed tasks.",
What I'm looking for is scheduling calls. Not just typing call so and so but click on call button and my contacts would pop up to choose from. When you have this I'll gladly pay a fee and will be strong proponent of the app.,
One of the best task managers. I specially like quick add function. But I can't use it because The free version doesn't have reminders and paid is very costly when there are many free options also available.,
"I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend.",
"Great, works with my Google home so I can just blurt out stuff that pops into my head without interrupting what I'm doing. I would like a bit more control over the details and settings in the app itself but that's just me",
"Used to love this app, but the new widget is ugly, unreadable, and too easy to accidentally check something. I'll be looking for a replacement if this hasn't been fixed by the time my subscription runs out.",
"great little app. not too intrusive, very intuitive, and super easy to use. I just wish i was better at following through on my lists so i didnt always have the tray icon reminding me of what I failed to do today!",
"Excellent app. It has got so many things. Looks great visually. Tho the whole monthly payment for a checklist app is too much. 1 dollar = 73 rupess. 4 dollar = 292 rupees a month. , 36 dollars is more than 2000 rupees. Please make the price more friendly. Other than that it's great.",
I love how easy it is to create the task with scheduling due to the way it picks up keywords. I haven't used it as much as I plan to but that I can interact with Todoist through my Google Home is a very appealing idea.,
"Good enough, but is not a replacement for my old character mode MS-Dos program I wrote years ago. What I need is to be able to add attributes to each task and select from a defined list of values for each attribute. I then need to be able to filter and sort by any selection of attributes and values. Labels are not enough for this. I also want to be able to report on the number of outstanding and done tasks by attribute including totalling effort estimates for each. Basically, underpin the app with a relational database and provide an SQL query facility.",
Very nice and useful. This app really helped me declutter my mind and thus become more productive. It has complete features and I think it's just right even without Premium. Truly recommend this app for those in schools and offices...,
Love this app for keeping me organised. Would be 5 stars if there was a calendar on the right side when using the desktop version. So I can choose which project I want to view on the calendar.,
the only reason I had premium was because I could get SMS notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications. beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar.,
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads",
"Looks decent, reminders locked behind a ridiculous pay wall. $48 PER YEAR. Why not a small one off payment? It's a simple app. I'm sure a lot of customers have walked away simply because the price is too high for what it is.",
"Would be a great app if you didn't have to pay for the pro version ($50/year!?) just to be able to get reminders/notifications for to-do items, seems like a very basic feature for a to-do list app to have.",
"The dev responded claiming the sign up process is easy, but **I don't need any of the features that signing up provides**. I do not want backups, or access from other devices. Mandatory sign in instead of these features being optional is why i continue to give this one star.",
"I have never run into problems with this app. it works amazingly. I use this from work school and home. From my desktop to my chrome book for school to my phone for travel, work, etc. best to do list ever!!",
"The mobile version is great, but is there a reason that the web interface is suddenly so slow and unwieldy? It's been a few weeks now, so I'm deleting this app and creating lists on a new app, in case anyone has any recommendations.",
"Really enjoy this app it has literally saved my life. I have a problem with how obsessed i am with to do lists and writing down everything, so this app has been awesome because i can keep it all in one place and even change up when i want to do it, etc.",
It's the best In my opinion. But I feel tasks should not just be overdue. I think introducing an option to indicate that you didn't do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks,
"I crave other ways that I can use my smartphone as a scheduler. this app closely approaches Google Keep which I use daily. There are many indispensable features that aren't used in any other ""productivity"" apps. Check it out, better yet, write a schedule and include experimenting with this app. Bet you find some pretty slick features!",
"Brilliant app! Gets to dos out of your head makes life easier to manage. Only critique is it could work with Google calendar and emails more seamlessly but they are working on that from what I hear. Download it, make it a habit!",
"The only thing that's missing is Scarlett Johansson's voice praising me everytime I complete a task. After hours of research, I realized that Todoist is the best choice for an organisational app. Really, really happy with my choice.",
"love it! Hiwever the with the new update & check boxes I am accidentally pushing & ""completing tasks"" that are not done, which is super frustrating. I also wish I could see all of my different Alexa lists.",
"its been really good and useful. I havrnt figured out how to link it to my google home, but im blaming user error. lol i love the projects feature and the easy switch btw desktop and mobile views and features. really happy with it!!",
"How did I ever get anything done before I found todoist? I use it on every device (the experience is seamless), for everything. Heck, I rely on it so much I just might upgrade and actually PAY for it... which is against my religion (I'm a practicing public librarian). As a planner, lister, former project manager who sees everything as projects, this is pretty close to perfection for me.",
"I've spent lot of time creating great multilevel reccuring subtasks just to find out that I actually see them unorganized in most needful page - today! And in Projects they are organized, but all together, regardless deadline. This is sooooo inconvenient, that makes having subtasks functionality just useless. Why can't you show subtasks under their parents everywhere? REPLY: Sorry, but it's inconsistent logic, as currently you show subtasks, that are NOT due today under task, that is due today.",
"Overwhelming. Too many little features that are too specific and useless to most, while basic things like reminders are only available if you upgrade. (In short: hard to use, and a but of a cash grab)",
"This app is so easy to use! Scheduling, using templates, differentiating projects, organizing ideas, and more is so simple and works just like my brain. Absolutely love it!",
Works well. Would be nice if there was an option for completed tasks to show with a strike through rather than disappearing forever. I like to see what I've achieved.,
have been using it for almost a year now and find it very useful. would like to see a feature where you can add a location to a task so as to make Google calendar and map integration more seamless.,
"I paid for premium on this and it is by far the best todo app I've used. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 stars for me is that it needs an option to set what time your day ends or when the day starts. Because i usually end my day at 2am and by that time tasks become overdue and karma points are not credited for the previous day. Nonetheless, great app üëèüèº",
"Very good app, which is helping me organise and manage my life. Not without its flaws (e.g.crashes and glitches). I have provided constructive feedback to the devs. One star off for penalising non-US purchasers. I resent paying unfairly in pounds what American customers pay in dollars (European customers are ripped off in the same way). The makers claim this is because they have to collect 20% VAT, but this still does not explain why I had to pay ¬£36 when I should have paid about ¬£26 plus the 20% (you do the maths).",
"Does the job perfectly for me! A great set of features with NLP and amazing sync with Google Calendar. No Ads! Love it An update made notifications for tasks as Pro only, A little disappointed since it's an important core feature :/",
I've only used it for 3 days but I have experienced a lot of bugs. Unfortunately their support email is not supported anymore so I have no ways of reporting. New tasks keep disappearing on me and my sections often duplicate for no apparent reasons.,
"Sending a request, setting a password, even attempting to delete my account gives an error. Tried to reset my password, and I got an error message saying the reset code has expired. Even the Chrome extension is useless.",
"Handy app to use for capturing and organising projects and tasks. Took me a little while to find my groove using it but I am finding it really useful when combined with elements of the ""Getting Things Done"" methodology.",
This is a great tool with a minimalist design. One feature I would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget. That would take this to the next level.,
super easy to use. creating and adjusting items is simple. the notifications settings gives lots of options. emails sent to make list items and websites as items are super helpful.,
Incredible app. Don't have words. But I would like to request you about adding a new feature of customisation of timing of when to start the date and also about adding a feature of Sub-section.,
"The app itself is totally fine. I've been using it extensively both for my personal and work GTD-management, the app has a lot of my personal data, activity and thoughts. I'm becoming more and more aware and worried about my digital privacy. Can't be overly careful with these things today. I don't use external authentication in Todoist because I don't want to randomly lose my account after some random ban in Google/FB. But I desperately need 2FA protection in Todoist! We're waiting for too long!",
Used to be amazing but the last day just keeps crashing and app won't open at all. Total disaster as I'm in the middle of a project. Website works fine but is much less user friendly on a mobile. Please fix the app!,
"everything I need to ensure I'm on track for my day, love it.",
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking.",
"it's fine. I dont have pro, but without experiencing it first i won't pay for it. or try a ""free trial"" after putting in my credit card info just to get charged unexpectedly or when i forget. i hate those.",
"Overrides set task order if priority is not at the same level - your selected chronological order will be ignored without any option to disable this. If tasks are completed and restored they go to the end of the list, not the position you chose making this inappropriate for projects that are recurrent like mapping out activities of daily living. 1 star from me + an extra since order may not be important to others (eg. for shopping lists).",
"Love it, hope you guys fix up the widget soon, I'm always having problems with it not switching the veiw to the next day",
"The best todo list app for sure. Been using it from a while, you can feel yourself being productive if you use this app regularly. There is no ads at all. UI is pretty straightforward and easy to use as well.",
Please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window. There are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc. Check how Google Calendar widget shows information in agenda mode.,
"honestly theres something just very satisfying about brain dumping into your inbox, assigning things to your ""Today"" box, and emptying that box every single day. as well as just organizing everything into ""Projects"" that give me an overhead view of everything I feel. its allowed me to focus more on one thing at a time, cause i know everything else is already organized",
"A great app that helps you keep track of tasks so quickly and easily! You can prioritise your tasks and add sub tasks so you can stay organised, I have also connected mine to my alexa for daily morning updates. Using this app really helps me to focus on what I am meant to be doing and how the week ahead is looking.",
I loved it but the recent update changed the reminder settings for pro only which requires a membership. Dissapointed in that change as it was complimentary all this while. Still a good app but not happy with the direction it is approaching. Goodbye Todoist!,
"There are apps with more features and 10000 other things inckuding making coffee for you but this one takes the cake. Simple, no fuss and straight forward functionality. Hit the ground running.",
"Overwhelming! Stop it! First time opening the app and I'm inundated wih a bunch of preorained tasks! This DOES NOT help someone with lack of motivation and a list of tasks already needed to take care of. I'm absolutely INSCENSED that an app could be so blind. Let the user make tasks manageable, instead of telling them what they should do!!",
"It's very helpful although, I would like the task to stay for the whole day instead or just cross it out so I could see what tasks I have accomplished. Overall, it exceeded my expectations. Good job!",
"It worked perfectly on my old Android 7 phone, but works awkwardly on another Android 11 phone with Nova Launcher. The widget keeps loading almost all the time, and the Add button doesn't. It works again if I open the app first.",
"Using it for the past 6 months, maybe less. Simple and clear design, you can track everything you're planning to do, also great widget.",
"I love everything about this app, especially the website which was great guides and blog posts, but a deal breaker for me is that the widget does not sync with your device theme (the app itself does, fortunately). Please change this!",
This app is a simple and easy to use way to make your goals seem effortless. The amount of things I have been able to accomplish as a new manager can be attributed to Todoist. I use it everyday and for everything. Don't bother trying to find a better tool to be efficient with your time.,
"Loved this app. There should be an option of setting different goals for different days of the week, rather than having single daily goal. I think it would be good feature to include. And also you can do that to week and months.",
"Found this very useful in keeping track of my todos, however, there are times where I accidentally check of a task before completing it. Is there a way to check tasks that have been marked off already and undo them? Update: Literally minutes later I found out how to undo them. You just go to your activity log and uncheck that specific task üòÖüòÑ",
"Their response to my original comment tells me whoever is responding doesnt have the app installed, i cant reply so heres another 1 star. I have turned off all emails in general and it doesnt matter. It will email me if i dont make a stretch goal for the day. I add the easy ones, the stuff i have to get done and my stretch goals. It will send an email for each and every missed todo for the day. Doing to much",
"by far the worst app I've ever used. first it didn't work well cuz it didn't save, uncheck boxes, etc ( ive used it for 2 months) then I tried to delete my account and I swear to you they made deleting the account extremely difficult on purpose first theres no way to delete it via the website which forced me to download the app and then the app asks me for my password but I loginned in using google months ago. so you gotta reset your setting and then delete the account. its absolute trash",
"Excellent task minder app. Allows me to create tasks from my email. Able to associate tasks with projects, tag them with labels, set due dates, get reminders in advance of due dates, set recurring tasks, set subtasks, set targets for my productivity, attach important files. A very thorough task minder, with both GUI and shortcut key inputs when creating tasks. I went from the free version to purchasing a subscription very rapidly. If you are keen on minding important tasks, consider this app!",
App is good but definitely not worth going with Pro version. In one year they increased annual subscription amount by 3-fold. I used pro version for last five years. But quit now since the current prices are insane. There are better alternatives at way lower prices.,
Great app for organising & tracking all sorts of work & projects. 5 stars if you could bring back option to create a Comment during the New Task. Adding a task description is good for some things but option to add a Comment at the same would cover all options.,
The app keeps on saying not responding. I can access it on my computer but thru my phone it just shows a black screen. Play give me a solution I have tried everything like clearing app data. Reinstalling etc.,
"Love the app! It's great for forcing me to do all those tiny daily jobs that I would otherwise find ways to avoid. Gone are the days of, ""I'll do it later""; now, the app tells me 'today is the day to clean kitchen hobs or get a haircut and you're going to do it whether you want to or not.",
"I wish it would cross off completed tasks instead of getting rid of them completely. I like the action of getting them crossed off but also having the ability to go back and see what I did that day, which I don't think this app does",
So smooth and versatile. Adjusts to what you want: straight forward if you want just a to-do list yet plenty of options if you want something more detailed.,
"great app. once you learn how to use it, it has all sorts of applications. worka across platforms, and syncs easily, even with other productivity apps.",
"It's a good app. You can even open your to do list on your computer and add tasks and cross them off on your pc, but the only thing wrong with it is that you don't get full access to all the features and you have to pay for some things",
"This app is amazing. I can easily track my personal work, as well as i can track my work for my business purposes. I can list, and mark it done as soon as i finish my work. Even the daily karma level, batch keeps motivating me to do more, to gain the Professional karma level batch. I totally recommend it.",
Moved to this app from any.do because the former app quit syncing with Amazon Alexa. This app syncs quite well with Amazon Alexa so I'm sticking with it. Takes care of both shopping and to do issues that I need. Quite happy so far.,
My boss recommended Todoist for keeping myself on task and organized. It's been so helpful and intuitive I've started using it outside the office. Very user-friendly interface.,
It's really helped me stay on top of the projects that I want to accomplish. I use the free version for a little while and decided it was worth paying for. The integrations are pretty cool too I'm looking forward to see what they roll out in the way of further integrations in the future.,
"Amazing app to manage my time, I don't forget tasks and my grades have improved a lot. All thanks to the amazing scheduling and reminders todoist provides. I will be sure to renew my subscription!",
Excellent app with desktop sync. Really good interface and options of allocating projects and labels etc to all tasks. Perfect to help be a lot more systematic and get on top of all work and home tasks.,
"This app has helped me manage my to do list in a more realistic and efficient way. It looks nice, it's easy to use and packed with simple but useful features. I now use two accounts one personal and one professional.",
it's fantastic! it's changed my whole way of working and reduced my stress levels enormously. Im doing a PhD and juggling several really challenging and unpredictable roles - todoist is helping me stay on top of a really complex range of tasks.,
"Great app but I faced a small annoying issue with the widget. If I check something off on my pc and opened my phone the widget is not updating even if I opened the mobile app, it is only updated inside the app and not in the widget. Until you fix this issue you can add a temporary solution which is a refresh button for the widget as in the app",
Todoist is a great app that executes the fundamentals with precision and excellence. I think this app is so helpful because its singular purpose in task management. I'm very pleased with my decision to go premium with this amazing piece of software!,
"The best GTD app I found so far. Stable, no crazy bugs, the sync is fast and it is awesome that will recognize due dates from written format (like on wednesday or tomorrow). I switched from Todo Cloud and I could not have been happier!",
"This app has everything you need and more. Fantastic widgits that help my efficiency, tons of ways to manage and organise your lists. I downloaded 20+ different list and note apps and this one definitely comes out on top.",
Using the free version. Would like to upgrade but I think $36/year is too expensive for the reminders and comments/files that I'd like access to. I am impressed with their privacy policy.,
"overall enjoy this app as a virtual bullet journal, but i wish I could have items that weren't attached to a date but just sit above or below the weekly view. also an in progress function would be useful.",
"This app helps me keep the grasp of every daily task as well as plan long term projects, and it works as tidy as possible. I couldn't recommend an productivity App more, it's just simple and effective. Thank you, Doist, for this amazing work.",
Beautiful and intuitive interface. Syncs with browser almost instantly. Very impressed with this app and happy that it has helped keep track of things i could have easily forgotten.,
Newest update - items I reschedule for another day keep popping up for today,
I use this to set daily reminders. One of the best apps I've used. Especially since I procrastinate so much. It helps me sort out my work and timings! I really enjoy it and I paid for premium to get the alarms. It's awesome. Thank you todoist!,
"This app is really good. however, I've been experiencing bug (?) lately and the app automatically exits my screen or it just turns white. same thing happens on my pc application.",
It's excellent and it is beneficial for students... The only thing that doesn't go well is the timer... It doesn't go off like an alarm. But this app truly keeps you focused.,
"love love love this app so much!! perfect way to organize my to-do lists and helps me prioritize any tasks I need to complete. ever since getting this app, I've been on top of all my work and have been more productive than ever. don't know what I'd do without this app, highly recommend!!",
"Great Todo app. Core features work as you'd expect. Syncing, sharing lists, adding notes (premium feature), filters. Also has Google home integration (a bit clunky, but works for adding tasks when phone isn't nearby).",
"Very useful integration with Chrome on desktop, sometimes a bit fiddly to set up recurring events using the text method, would rather make specific selections. Overall best task manager i have found.",
"Very good app. There are some features not available unless you upgrade but seriously I don't need those. This is a great, and simple, tool and helps me especially being not that organized a person",
Free version does all I need it to do. Creating tasks is simple an intuitive and even I even add subtasks sometimes. it really helps me to stay on task and keep track of what I have to do day to day.,
"So far the best to-do app I have used. Easy to add tasks and keep track of them, love the calendar features since I don't have to constantly remember to add repetitive tasks.",
"Useful but incredibly clunky application. The rescheduling tries to be very smart, and ends up being completely broken, with rescheduling not being set (on task edit), or tasks being scheduled on the wrong day on completion.",
Everything is well and good and easy to organise. *BUT* Reminder (Previously enabled) SHOULDN'T BE A PREMIUM FEATURE. Please look into it. This is a basic feature across other to-do apps.,
It might be better for other people but what I want is really just a simple to do list and reminder.,
"Todoist is exactly what I needed. Being able to create to-dos on a desktop or laptop browser, then being able to check them off on the mobile app makes things very easy.",
dislike the new update. has screwed the widget up. the individual lines are taking up too much space and its too easy to accidentally hit those checkboxes. then yoy have to go into the app and undo.,
"After almost 1 year of trying to adopt, I have given up. Repeating tasks are nice but not when they end up on the wrong days because they change during set up. App tries to do too many things.",
Will not open keeps crashing,
The best app for organizing.,
It's really good helps me manage my projects and stuff,
I do not like the continued forced reviews!!!! if you want authentic reviews from people give them space and allow them do it in their own time!!!!,
best to-do list app!! it's super clean and easy to use but it still has all the features you'll need. you can do mostly everything you'll need in a to-do list without buying premium which is nice plus no ads.,
I really like the app. But when you will make a nice compact ( yet informative) view for the app and desktop? It will bring app to next level as it will look less overwhelming. At least for me.,
"Hello Doist, this is the best task management app I've ever seen and I wish you the best of luck making this app better for all of us. I have one request for a feature, I would like to use custom colours for my priorities. Thank You very much in advance, from a long-term user.",
"Rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working. Rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear, earlier I have experienced that it duplicated tasks. This way a basic functionality is broken and I just lost what should I follow-up today... No activity log available, as that is a paid feature. I guess I will never try that now.",
"Just wanted a basic notepad to keep track of things to do, instead had to grant access to a bunch of stuff and now it won't stop emailing me. Ended up uninstalling and have to block the emails. Way too intrusive.",
"I'm not a fan of having to use a paper diary to keep my life on track. Todoist has saved me in more ways than one - I can access it from any device unlike ColorNote, and it motivates me with the Karma system. The only gripe? I've only used it for a week and still don't know how to use it effectively.",
designing filters very helpful for sorting and prioritizing while keeping BIG picture. great to have info across platforms. easy to add items on the goal. Well written help guides and usful tutorials on YouTube.,
"Awful. Upgraded to premium and tried to use it. Completely unintuitive, difficult to use and definitely not user friendly. I got so frustrated with it I literally cancelled my subscription right away.",
"Tried every solution on market, can say for sure, it's the best planner for now",
I like using this for personal use and wish I could have more lists instead of just 6.,
"I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane.",
"Convenient, but I suspect it arbitrarily deletes tasks, and the support team isn't helpful. Support ticket 692041. Happened several months ago, and yesterday happened again. I'm now looking for alternatives, as I can't trust Todoist. Now evaluating Google Tasks.",
"Todoist is an amazing task management tool. I can organize my tasks into projects and subprojects, set due dates, and enter recurring tasks. My mind feels so much less cluttered now that I can offload things to Todoist. Highly recommended!!!",
"Loved this app until it started giving me a ""permission denied"" error every time I tried to open it. Deleted, downloaded again and it worked for a day before giving me the same error. I have not had this problem with any other app, so I can only assume the issue is with Todoist.",
"Love this app. I use it to keep track of ongoing, long term projects. But you can use it for day to day task (to do list) management Very easy to learn your way around the app and get started quickly. Highly recommended.",
"Still no way to bulk-clear completed tasks. You're also limited to 5 ""projects"" (Todoist's name for groups of tasks, like ""Groceries"", ""To Do"", etc.) Were you an early adopter that had more projects? Don't delete any of them, they'll be gone forever. This was my go-to note taking app for years. No longer.",
After the update all my completed sub tasks were deleted. I set those up because I uncheck them every month when I need to use the same lists over and over. Really annoying especially since I don't think I'll be using the new features at all.,
"This task/project management app revolutionised my life, brought about a clear judgement for prioritizing and balancing work & personal life. My favourite is the recurring task functionality which is excellent for habit creation but not also building consistency in project management. 4/5 cuz I haven't used the premium version yet.",
this app is so amazing man omg names project management/task management so much easier for me!! was using Any.do before which is good as well but this one is way better since I have multiple projects/task groups going on. Only thing I dislike is that add comments is behind a paywall. I wish you had that in the free version just consider it! any.do has it in free version. 5/5 stars still,
Fantastic experience using todoist. Really impressed with the simplicity and it's helped me manage my responsibilities much better than I ever could have imagined. Getting tasks out of my head and into todoist had changed my life!,
"Brilliant, but need time to learn. I use this in combination with David Allen's Mastering Workflow philosophy. Very helpful. But it takes several days to 'upload' all your priorities and tasks to the app. That is to do with human strategy, not the app. But the app makes it quick and easy to structure.",
Unable to sync with Google calendar on Android. Unable to cancel lost $36 bucks in 30 minutes. Had to get pro to set up feature. The mistake I made was not starting with 1 month. Leave and learn. Refund from these people none existent.,
"I've been using Todoist for years now and it keeps improving, the Latest foundations update has really changed things for me the addition of sections and the task view with subtaks has reduced the sheer volume of projects and sub projects to manage as I can now fit them into a smaller number of better organised projects. The task view is a master stroke as I am able to focus in on a particular task. the only Improvement I'd ask for is the ability to track my time spent on tasks a countdown timer that I can set myself from the task view so I can take breaks at more healthy intervals and timebox tasks as well as giving me data to help me better estimate my future tasks. Keep up the great work guys, your work is a life saver to me",
Really Great app to start organized. I've been using the mobile app in addition to the desktop app and the two have incredible synergy! Todoist was even nice enough to offer a trial of the premium version,
"Was a bad decision to move to ticktick instead of this great app, will move back to todoist soon again.",
"Love the desktop version. Ability to quickly add task using shortcut is my fav, without having to go application window. I wish there was an ability to add comments in free version.",
"Todoist is the best to-do list app I have encountered & I have tried A LOT of them. Reminders? Subtasks? Tags? File attachments? Voice recording? Subprojects? Integrations? They even have templates and a blog that gives productivity tips. 2 months ago I would have suggested they have kanban boards. I was integrating MeisterTask and Todoist through Zapier because of this. But just like that, they introduced the board feature and I immediately deleted MeisterTask, just like that.",
"So far Todoist has worked fine, but the fact they want you to pay a monthly fee to set a ""reminder"" is ridiculous. So many times I'm in the middle of something and can't finish a task right then and I want to be able to set a reminder. Time to move on to another app.",
"Great app!! The only thing that would it make better is color-groups. For example if a few things are about the same subject, you should be able to put them together. Then you get a better overview.",
Receiving way too many emails and reminders on my personal email and as notifications. It's crazy spamming! It's also not easy to organize with. I'd use simpler notes apps to jot down ideas and lists.,
"I think it would be more competitive if one or two of the paid for functions were free but overall it's a solid app. It functions well for how and why I use it. No complaints so far, just good vibes!",
"It's simple and easy to use. I like it very much. I use on my mobile and computer that made me handle my a lot of task. But I want a calendar view function, so I can see clearly my task of all month. Do you have a plan to add it?",
"Very simple, yet has the most thoughtful features. Been using the free version for over a year now and my productivity and peace of mind have both skyrocketed.",
Integration with Google Calendar is second to none. New card (kanban) view is amazing on both my desktop and Android phone. Have tried them all. Keep coming back to Todoist. Just the best.,
Great app. I'd never be able to keep track of all of my work to-do items without it and the projects function makes it super easy to keep my stuff organized and easy to find.,
a paid to do list application with notifications and reminders that don't work... so many times I've forgotten to do things because this app was supposed to remind me and didn't. that's unacceptable. switching to the Free gtasks instead.,
"Cool app, very essential, I could do without the lingering toasts on the bottom that cover all of the actions I might like to take on a selection for a ridiculous amount of time.",
"Really easy to use task manager, ability to schedule posts and get alerts when you're over due, great layout in projects or per week, ability to add links, emails, and subtasks - made my work life a lot easier!",
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.,
light weight enough not to slow you down. Enough features to build a system out off. Any idea or thing that needs doing through the day just gets thrown in here to get it out of my head.,
"Can you fix the bug where when adding a task, the keyboard fills up past the options that lets you select priority and projects? It's not critical but it's annoying to see at a UX level",
"Quite simply, the best. Cannot get over how user-friendly Todoist is--the devs clearly designed with *intention*. Pre-made templates are a godsend, text markup/emoji integration made me smile, and powerful organizational features made me stay. Kudos üôå",
I use todoist every day and dont lose track of routines and/or infrequent but very necessary tasks. it's easy to use snd understand. I've used it on a couple of projects with success.,
"Initial Review after one week: Enjoying the simplicity and ease of access, organization level, and the speed that a project and group can be configured. The only issue I've had is changing indentation or parent/child relationships on tasks. wish more of the app was available to free tiers, but they've gotta make money somehow so i cant blame them.",
"Hey todoist! Why are you todoing this to me!? First you put these silly little checkmarks on my tasks that are 100% in my way (leftys are people too). I keep unintentionally deleting tasks and having to dig through my completed items to restore them. That's annoying! Now this latest update, you've taken away subgroups? Subgroups are part of the entire project. Having an overall view of all subs within a group is convenient. Having to flip from sub to sub is illogical. I just don't get it!",
"I just switched from doit.im, as I wanted something that looked better and felt easier to use. Todoist is pretty great so far. I will say that I think Todoist is for people who like to track details about their tasks. If you just like lists and check boxes. Todoist will probably feel like too much.  The one complaint I have is how they handle project templates. Oddly, the only way to create templates is by exporting an existing project to a csv file, or creating one in a csv file. You then have to manually import the csv file to create a new project. So every time I want to create a ""Prepare to go camping"" project with all the sub-tasks, I have to import a csv. and I don't think it can be done in the mobile app. This should all be handled within the app. You should be able to save any project as a template in the app and then create a new project based on a template in the app; and those templates should be synced across your devices. I really hope they are working on this. Dealing with csv files is clunky and not what I would expect given the quality of the rest of the tool.",
"Developer holds notifications as ransom for a monthly payment. Would be acceptable for a small membership fee, but I have to pay for all of premium just to get notifications, the whole point of a to-do app? No thanks.",
"Great app! It is very organized and can keep all your tasks together. The only con is that you need to pay for reminders. Personally, reminders should be a free feature.",
"Not sure if I did not do the settings right or what, but I never got notifications for this app, I got plenty of useless emails that I only check once a day. I had all permissions and app notifications on. Just not worth it.",
Best to-do.list app ever,
"Great experience with this app. I prefer it to Asana or Monday because not unless you have 100 member project management teams, this tool is simple, detailed, and to the point. You can even assign projects to be shared with certain clients or teams. I make my assistant's list for her and can see when things are complete. The price is right for a young entrepreneur or small business. The trouble is the comment section doesn't let me record my voice in Android or Apple phones. Great app",
"This is the best productivity app. Ever, it has simple and understandable UI, it sync across all platforms, it even integrates with my pomodoro app. I am enjoying it very well and i can endorse it to anyone having trouble make their day.",
"4/3/21 Looks like they don't listen to reviews as reminders are STILL a ""Premium Feature."" Thanks for nothing. 10/25/20 I was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms, but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this. Come on Todoist! Reminders should never be a ""Premium Feature"" in a task management app!!!",
"I love it, intuitive with great features in free version, It's not filled with ads or shady marketing, when it's done this way I might actually want to go premium :) keep up the good work and thank you!",
"Good overall. I'd love to be in able to change which time of the day marks the change between ""Today"" and ""Tomorrow"". I go to sleep past midnight, so it means my todo list shows lots of recurring tasks for ""today"" that are actually meant for tomorrow. It'd be much nicer to be able to go to sleep with an emtpy list.",
"no ads, rewarding task completion, easy interface, lovely organization :D",
"Great app, some annoyances. I don't usually review apps, and am only writing this in the hope that it will stop asking me to rate it after every single action. Having clicked no I don't expect to be asked to write a review again 5 minutes later. Other than that the app works as it should.",
"Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it.",
use it on the daily. simple formatting and can be adjusted - but not too many options that it gets overwhelming. very user friendly and they have great blogposts on their websites.,
"Very useful and handy. The simplicity of managing tasks pops this app out of hundreds. I'm enjoying using it and wheater you're a student or a very busy working-at-aoffice person, I highly recomend it. You won't regret.",
"I have been using it for years now, but the windows version is still not as perfect as Android version. When I open the windows 10 version of todoist, the app load takes too long",
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes t",
"This is an excellent list-based organizational app made even better with (near) seamless integration into Google calendar. ToDoist has replaced all planners/calendars I had, and I'm grateful for that.",
"Love it. Only tweak I'd love to see is when you have something to reschedule and you open the Smart Rescheduler feature, when you click on the item you can customize the suggested date.",
"Great app, helps me achieve my goals. When I neglect to use it my productivity drops. This app really keeps me focused, especially with recurring, easy to overlook, tasks",
One of the few apps i use everyday (and I have been for more than a year now). A true productivity work horse with an elegant and meaningful user interface. Todoist slips right into my daily habits.,
I find this app to be very helpful when it comes to keeping track of everyday things I need to accomplish and one off tasks I need to quickly jot down before i forget. it's easy to use and a great way to start organized!,
"Like many others, the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively. What used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks. It wasn't broken, why did you have to 'fix' it. I'm hoping they roll back some of these changes, if they don't I will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app.",
"""You can do eet!"" EDIT: Often crashes when using version downloaded from the Chromebook Play Store. I prefer to use the Chrome Extension do to its reliability and its hotkeys/shortcuts(?).",
"Really simple and easy to use, could do with a usable month calendar instead of just 7 days. And the option to set an alarm for high priority tasks/reminders",
"If you are looking for a incredible to do list, go no further. Todoist has made great strides since I first started to use their web app. Natural language additions are a nice touch.",
"Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be happy to pay, but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered. At least not for my usage.",
"This is the best To-Do app I have found so far, but it's missing some features I would love to have. Sometimes behaves weirdly, when you operate on lists with hundreds tasks.",
"Have been using this app for quite some time and I loving it. Would love it even more if at least some of the features that are for the Pro version made are made available for free. Please developers, if u r seeing my comment, please make some features like ""adding tags"" and ""adding colors to Texts"" etc available for free. Would be extremely grateful if feature to add colour to Texts is made available. Thanks. Please do it",
"Edit: Developers have fixed the bug and now this is back to my most used app. Definitely recommend it! Original review: Was a great app, suddenly completely stopped working. Will happily change my rating back to 5 stars when the bugs are fixed. Cheers!",
"Best to do list tool. I have 30 things to do every day but this app keeps me in line and I meet my deadlines. Between remote work, homeschooling, running errands and holiday shopping, this is so useful. I even have it on my laptop so to the team who created this...thank you!",
"best task manager ever, with this app, i always get the task done before the due date, it's also easy to manage and reschedule tasks. it's a magical experience altogether.",
"I love the simple, flexible interface, and that it's integrated with so many apps that I use. I just wish it was integrated with OneNote too.",
"I purchased this as a micro project management tool only to discover that it is incredibly restrictive and one of its functions. Its functions are absolutely incredible, but the problem is you can only raise so many tasks within a project? This is not mentioned anywhere in the spec and I would not of purchased it, because that‚Äôs the only way that you find out after you‚Äôve purchased it, if I knew to only allowed 300 tasks within a project is incredibly small. So just a warning this is nothing b",
"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer. It was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option. But now I have to go through my hidden gift stash. Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time.",
"So useful, so great the way it syncs up with my laptop. Best to do list app out there for sure. Wish you could see your past tasks would be my only improvement.",
"It was a great app - until I got locked out of my account one day, for no reason, and lost all my tasks. Update: I reached out to Todoist support and they promptly replied. The issue was fixed the same day. Ok, I'm back on board! :-)",
"Very simple check list application, if you don't pay no teminders, no comments, nothing. Also there's no even taking simple notes stuffs. Just checklist and and sub task. If you want very basic, use it but tick tick ist best one. Sorry guys. It's reality",
"Great app. The best to do list app, hands down üëç üíØ",
"Meh, it's OK. Same as Microsoft To-Do but you have to pay for extra features. Plus, you can't add multiple accounts and have items pull from multiple calendars. I like MTD better.",
"It needs far easier editing of individual tasks for more details, including bulleted lists and other tools. Just having an overview of To-Dos is insufficient in many instances.",
"Just migrated to Tick Tick - it's better with more holistic useful functionality and cheaper with free version having not that much restrictions like in Todoist. Sorry guys, it seems you have some work to do if you want to stay competitive.",
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it.",
Easy to use and keeps me on top of urgent tasks. Have mine set up as a widget and easy to see what I have to do each day. Works really well for the features I use in the free version.,
This app has the same functionalities on all platforms and adapts very well to the device you're using it on. Adding tasks is very easy with the button in the notification menu.,
"When you complete a task it disappears!! Not a good function - means you can't remember what you accomplished, and you don't get the satisfaction of seeing a big list of things crossed out (something list makers love!)",
"Its a good list app. But the reason why i give it a low response is that you have to pay a subscription to be able to use things such as reminders and alarms, which i need to be able to even remember that i have a list of things i need to do on a daily basis. Apart from that solid app.",
"This app is simple and clean. I have ADHD, and I forgot what to do without a to-do list. As a result, I have tried many similar apps. This app is far and above my favorite. It's simple and easy to complete or reschedule tasks. Love it!",
I todoist for time management and productivity. I have used it with small work teams also and the shared folders/shared task features are great. I recommend it to other and love it so much I became an affiliate.,
"As someone who isn't interested in task sharing or syncing, I find it insulting Todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a one-time unlock. That's just greedy.",
Overall the app's great! More like was...before the feature where one can't see the tasks in the subprojects was introduced. I actually prefer it that way. Would have been a 5/5 otherwise.,
Love it! Would like to see an option to keep completed tasks archived in the future so I can look back on when I completed things for work. Edit: Thank you for the response! Loving this all so much. Desktop version is amazing as well.,
"It works, but many of the best features are behind a subscription. I'd consider a one-time purchase, but the app definitely isn't worth what a year's subscription would cost.",
Very very difficult to understand and use this app,
wonderful todo daily goals...and weekly goals of the project work,
Super charging productivity. Best app in 2023 for me,
very useful tool to keep life orgnized,
Single Best Organising App.,
This app works great for me. Its even better after I smoke üëΩüëç,
Why on earth would a to do list app need you to make an account?? There is no reason for that.,
"I have been using it for a very long time. So far, I have not met better alternatives.",
"Use it constantly, love it, always suggesting it to people.",
very useful..thanks to all member who contribute for this app,
"Need a monthly subscription to manage a toto list? Give me a break. Went to add a SINGLE kitten and was told I had to update to pro to get notifications? Well sorry, but that kinda defeats the purpose. Some people have a hard time remembering the tasks which is why they use a list.",
"Really good app w nice interface and easy to learn layout. Lets u divide tasks by ""projects"" which i find really useful! Also gives subtasks, which also helps a lot. Would recommend :)",
"Great app! Todoist will send reminders that I have 0 due for the day. This makes me think twice if I really have nothing to complete for the day which that is not the case! So it makes me add task and by the end of the day, I got some things done!",
"I enjoy it for what its worth, with a nice interface and customisation, but basic features like reminders for tasks are subscription only, which defeats the second bullet point in the app description.",
"I struggle keeping on top of things, tried many different apps, this one is the best by far. a clean to do list, no pandering, just productivity.",
"I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead.",
"I liked the app, it was missing a few things but It was okay. I uninstalled it at one point, until I decided if I wanted to keep it, but I am still getting notified for the reminders. It is incredibly annoying and I can't figure out why... Edit: Thanks for the help, the problem is now that I don't know what account I logged in with.",
One of the best To-do list i have ever used. It has lots of feature which helps to work efficiently and effectively. I'm almost using it for 2 months and i really like it. Thanks You Developers for such amazing app.‚úå,
Has frustrating sync problems. Won't sync unless I have Todoist open on both devices. I've used Todoist for 8 years and it's the first time I've had this problem.,
The best ever todo app i have ever used... Helps me plan my week in advance and get things done. Love the natural language processing and features like projects and labels. Highly recommended to stay on top of your game.,
"This has been the go-to way wyeve managed my family's projects and errands for years ar this point. It's intuitive, works great on every platform we've used, and is really easy to use for both ad-hoc stuff and bigger projects.",
"There is a bug in the app. After i deleted one of the templates i got from the todoist app, it wont open anymore. I set up all daily routines from another app. This is very annoying.",
"Todoist is a great app for organizing your time and to do list. Easy to use and good reminders in email, not on going annoying notices like some apps. Highly recommend to organize your life.",
"Literally life changing app. Such a clean, easy to use interface and a great accompanying blog explaining how to use it well. I recommend it to anyone who will listen.",
"Room for improvement. It would be nice if subtasks could have different statuses in boards, and completing them could automatically complete their parent task. Nonetheless, this app is impressive.",
Best. App. Ever. I love Todoist. I've tried lots of to do list & project management apps but this one comes out on top. A few things I love that you can do: ‚óèCreate general tasks or lump those tasks under a specific project ‚óèFlag tasks by priority level ‚óèAdd date & time deadlines to tasks & how easy it is reschedule/postpone as needed ‚óèBrain dump details on projects I plan to prioritize later or work on as I have time ‚óèSimple integration with Google calendar I'm a Todoist user for life!! ü•∞,
"YOU TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT, Poindexter! No email is necessary to TRY IT OUT FIRST. IF a user decides to keep it, THEN they can create an acct AFTER TRYING IT OUT. READ FIRST before you give a pointless answer! ü§¶üèª Uninstalled as soon as I opened it. YET ANOTHER app that STUPIDLY won't let you try it WITHOUT an acct first to see if it's even going to work for you. ANOTHER BAD FIRST IMPRESSION..... NEXT APP!!!",
"Helpful, allows me to keep track of things very intuitively. I get a lot of ""brain fog"" due to my chronic conditions, and this app helps me stay on top of everything.",
"Have always found this one of the best apps in this category, but since the last update is now continually shutting down the app every time you update or save a task.....very frustrating.",
been using this for years now and it fits the best with how i work. never found a better app. some ideas for improvement - floating tasks (not meant to be completed but occur daily) - feature for making notes that change daily,
it's a great app in general. the Android version just a little less full featured than the web version. i find the interaction with Google's assistant a little buggy.,
"What good is a task app if it can't remind you to do a thing? I understand that the developers need to make ends meet, but reminders not being free is really obnoxious and prevents me from switching to it full-time.",
"Cannot get it to stop asking me to verify the time zone. Pressed yes, kept asking. Pressed don't ask again, kept asking. Pressed no, kept asking. Finally deleted. I'll use the the one that comes with outlook. It's not as versatile but it doesn't ask me to verify my time zone every time I look at it. Especially when I ask it not to ask me again.",
I use the free versions. Works well and syncs wonderfully between my Windows laptop and my Android phone. The Project categories are well used by me and I find the smart date recognition excellent.,
"Theres no other app like todoist in the playstore. Good job. This app was what I was searching for, it has everything that I need expect one little thing. If there was an option to add an alarm for the remainders, that would be great. I hope the developers will add it soon.",
Todoist works well to keep prioritized lists that can be worked through as time permits. Use Alexa to add items to your inbox. Later move them to projects or work them from your inbox. Lots of flexibility.,
Has literally changed my life. I use it for everyday tasks and chores. My husband and I literally no longer argue about what needs to be done around the house. I also use it as a grocery list as well so my husband and I can add things to it and when we go to the grocery store we just swipe of that we got it. Absolutely life changing.,
Does not sync well with the desktop's browser. Completed or new tasks on one do not appear on the other. Todoist is not much use unless I can use both devices.,
"Updates keep making the app worse for power users I can no longer type `3p` to make something due at 3pm when renaming a task. In fact, I cant find a way to assign a time to a task after its been created at all. If i do it the long way (assign time -> choose time on clock -> click ok) the time never gets assigned I can no longer type `p1` to give it first priority when renaming a task I used these features all the time and now it takes me significantly more time to perform these actions",
life changing. boards or something similar to the other to do apps would be good. not tried the project sharing either but that is a great feature i know that works well. widget on oneplus 6 is amazing.,
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.,
Incredibly helpful. My shortterm memory is trash and this app helps me keep track of all my random tasks for work and personal life. Love that it works seamlessly switching between my phone and laptop.,
"Useful, however some parts are not intuitive, for example its easy to think you've set a reminder when you haven't, because you didnt click the final OK.",
"I have tried other ""To Do"" lists before and this is by far the easiest ap I have used. I now combine Todoist with Trello and Evernote. Some projects in my opinion need Todoist plus either Trello or Evernote. Some jobs for today just require Todoist. Whatever I do I always use Todoist first and complement it with the other systems as and when needed",
"New update has caused a lot of issues with the widget. Every time I complete a task, it resets to load my list from the top. I need to scroll down every single time. Please fix.",
"This is the BEST to-do list app. I have tried many over the years and this is the one I have stuck with! It offers everything I need, attractive layout, and always adding new options.",
Todoist has helped me keep my life moveing forwared consistently by helping me organize my goals and acheive them. One thing is I am truly a broke college student and want the pro version functions but csn not afford them. Great app though!,
"Really helpful to track project with simple interface and easy to use. Anyway, it's not a variety of the feature but quite simple.",
App and its functionality are amazing. Really wish there was just a one time fee to unlock all of its features :( As much as I love it.. I just cant do a subscription...,
"After the latest update, tasks get duplicated and deleted at random. EDIT: for whatever reason, it stopped happening, I can't recreate the issue anymore. Soo ^-^",
"Absolutely amazing, it has no clutter and everything you need, excellent widgets to manage your work from the homescreen, it does what it's supposed to do really well.",
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month.",
"I'm only two weeks in and purchased premium and killing it (even more than usual) at work. I love this program! I mostly use it on my desktop but it's great for when I think of things after hours, am on the road with my boss or walking out he office door and someone throws something my way I need to remember.",
"I have been able to stream line my life and really focus on what means the most to me even with the distractions of 8th grade, moving states, and going to a new high school. I love the app!!!",
"I love Todoist and use it all the time! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish I could set reminders for individual tasks without upgrading to premium. That's the only premium feature I really wish I had. Other than that, it's a very useful app!",
Todoist is just what I need to manage my life. A great place to capture tasks as they cross my mind and put them on a schedule. Otherwise they go into the ether and never get done. Like how tasks also show up on my calendar and then on Echo Show.,
This app is very unsafe. They ask you to sign up with your email address and password. The sign up page is very similar to Gmail and may fool people into using their Gmail password. Any app that uses such tactics to capture your email sign in details cannot be trusted. Its is compounded by the fact that they don't ask you to confirm your password on sign up. Immediately uninstalled due to trust issues. Stay away!,
Great for keeping track of your life. Widgets make it easy to see your list at a glance. Just wish it would integrate with my windows calendar and samsung calenders on my phone and pc.,
"This has been great! Helps me quickly as reminders and keep myself organized! I love that the recurrences can be pretty random, for example: ""every 19 days""",
"Does what's supposed to do and does it well, I did like the previous UI more and would like a feature to swap between old and the new one, but it doesn't really matter that much still gets the job done, I'm only more used to the old UI",
"Todoist tracks all my required tasks, ensuring that none slip between the cracks. I would give it 5 stars if it had task dependencies and an easy way to download all completed tasks in one step.",
Generally very good. I have a few problems when I use it for reminders. working out what I need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging.,
Not only does this app help one in getting things done... It helps you as an individual to just get organized and you end up realizing that there is always enough time to do everything... I highly recommend!!,
"great app. very easy to use. even though there is a paid version, i like the free version. The limmits are some thing you can look over and on top of that NO ADDS. just perfect.",
"After I found out Wunderlist was going away I look for an app that could do all the things that could do as it was pretty much perfect for me todoist is pretty much as good, not perfect but for free I can't complain!",
"Used to be an avid user of the app, but now sync occasionally does not work with the Chrome extension. Both are updated to newest version.",
I have been using the app for about a month and let me tell you! It is so delightful to cross out all your tasks and seeing how productive you are throughout the day. It is nice that you can set deadlines and add tasks and subtasks to be completed. I am now contemplating going premium!,
"I downloaded and purchased premium for this app on New Years 4 years ago after being fed up of the slump I was in. Since then my productivity had improved significantly and my mental state immeasurably. This honestly has to be the best value for money purchase I've probably ever made. Highly, highly recommended.",
"Tried it, but have found some smoother apps. The dates (how the dates function) on the task list became way to cumbersome. Need something more like a backlog. A bit pricey.",
my husband and I use this app all the time. keeps us organized and on the same page. allows us to coordinate our grocery list and know what the other one needs! reduced marriage arguements by 25%.,
"Great experience! I love that its available on every platform, great job guys. I hope you'll add the feature to edit task like document (like Notes app of Apple) then it will be perfect üëå",
"I was a Wunderlist user until Micro$oft forced me to another platform. To Do is not the answer. Then I tried Todoist and I find it almost as good as Wunderlist was. A few more keypresses are required, but it is still very well done.",
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars.",
"Good interface, design. Could make it more interesting by using subtasks, a leaderboard, and motivational quotes and option to set constant reminders.",
"Initially it didn't let me view the shopping list synced from Alexa on my Android Smart Watch. However, as the developer says, if it is added to the Favorites, Alexa shopping list gets synced.",
Simply the best best task manager I've ever tried. My productivity multiplied. Thank you devs.,
"Works fine, but not very handy with active usage of one-handed mode gesture",
Simple and straightforward. Is very user friendly and has many ways to support you throughout a day. The only thing that I wish it had was a one off purchase price instead of monthly rates.,
"Add new task button is disappearing every time I start the app. Samsung Galaxy S8. Fix it, please.",
Wants you to pay ¬£4 every month for setting additional reminders. Uninstalled.,
GREAT redesign! Really love being able to swipe up from the bottom! Gone are the days of having to reach with my thumb or using two hands. The change is very simple and easy to get used to.,
Love the app but it has recently developed crashing problem at startup!,
"This app allows me to be more productive as I have deadlines to follow even for the most mundane chores. I love the reminders as they help me complete tasks when I need to on busy days by reminding me to do them in the first place. Keep up the good work, developers of Todoist!",
Simply the best ToDo app I've ever used and I've tried a lot of them! Warm thanks to developers!,
Best app ever to come across It is simple and easy to plan hour by hour daily routine,
Amazing app. Easy to use and it does raise my productivity level.,
Love this app. It helps me organize my day to day schedule so well.,
"Almost perfect, exept for when it sometimes crashes in the middle of editing or doesnt arrange the tasks into subcategorie. I always have the process saved tho. Wonderful and functional otherwise",
Best listing app ever makes my mornings jobs so easy cannot reccomend this highly enough!,
The best app of all time for planning and scheduling tasks üòÄ,
Now reminders aren't working! Your trouble shooting guide did not help.,
"Simple and very easy to use, clean ui!",
App doesn't have any alarm system on scheduled time of task.,
"I have to say it would be hard for me to live without a to-do list. Todoist is a great implementation of that and I just use it for everything. Work, home, personal things, mobile, desktop, web Todoist is there to help me. Todoist team, great work, thank you!",
The app is very good. It makes more productive. The premium features are also good but one issue is that the price should be less for INDIA (INR). As the price is in dollars the price is high for INDIAN.,
It is easy to use and has helped me organize my tasks. Having it on the xomouter and my ohone makes it more accessible. Daily email reminders helps as well. Great app!,
todoist is the best. great for getting your life in order. it took 3 months but its now du riguer. the only thing its missing is the ability to do high level multi phase projects - i want to use it for my work,
What the hell !? It is indeed a good app for managing tasks but the most annoying thing in this app is that there is no reminder or notification for a task set at certain time. This is such a basic feature but this is paid in this app. Is this a joke? I've seen many people complaining about this problem.,
"Love the idea and functionality of the app but it consistently crashes for me. Luckily it saves the last edits made, however, it is still hard to use when it crashes so often",
"few bad part as a free user is it don't have windows shortcut to make the task from anywhere. another is there is no system to look the date and what are the current task on date... just like any calendar otherwise i really love sub-task, sub-sub task, sub project...this is really helpful to break a project into different parts",
The best app and desktop software I've found for my project/task management needs. I absolutely love that I can put several layers of subtasks into my project. Keep up the great work guys.,
"Have been using this app for a couple of years as my daily to-do list. It works well for that purpose. Would be better if one could embed pictures with items in the list, e.g. for shopping.",
Does exactly what the package says. Makes managing projects and to-do lists super fast and easy. I especially like the repeating lists feature.,
"One week in, so far so good! With the mobile app, the windows app, and the chrome extension I can access my list anywhere. I'm becoming a productivity master. Will upgrade to premium soon.",
"How do I take off all the auto generated things todoist adds to my list? It makes me feel more stressed when you add things like ""vacuum clean all rooms"" or ""check work emails"". How can I have a simple list that only I add to? It stops me from even opening the app, anymore. I hate seeing a list of tasks someone else created for me.",
"I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this.",
"Basic options locked from free app and only available under a subscription and marketing emails after just signing in with Google. If you just want reminders, as I did, this is severely over-developed.",
Awesome app very easy to use with in-depth features that have solved my should I stick with paper system vs going digital. Todoist is the one app that has made me make the switch and its great üëç,
Really good. Used Google keep normally but it's better since it offer automatic scheduling and rescheduling options. Rough time with tuition but when I graduate I plan to use premium.,
Great to-do list app! Does everything I would expect. The only feature I wish it had is to be able to log in to two different accounts and switch between them easily.,
sync between gcal was so bad that I wasted plenty of time waiting to add a single task. For almost half a year it worked fairly nice but that problems with sync today was enough to lose any trust for keeping important task on that platform,
"Fighting the input method rather than getting stuff done. ""Natural language"" will no way allow me to set a task called ""Register for 3 Oct SAT test"" for this Friday. Something simple as adding a note requires Premium. I'm going back to ToDo",
"One of the best tools to get things done. Easy to use, clean interface, synchronization across multiple platforms. Powerful, yet quick to master. Highly recommended!",
"The perfect app for to do lists. You can have multiple lists, transfer items between lists, and share your lists. I use it all the time.",
Super easy to use. I am a full-time college student and Todoist helps me keep track of what assignments I have due when. I honestly would be failing all my classes if it wasn't for this app.,
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.,
"They just added a 5 project limit. I now have to move all the information I had on this to another to do list. If you want any type of organization with your to do lists, this is not for you. If you just want a to do list and don't care how it is organized, then this is perfect.",
I dislike the update but mostly I dislike that it was changed and I had to look here to find out why. If you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when I open it. I am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration.,
"Great app, I use it all the time to stay organised! The latest update tho has made it so the text on my homescreen widget is white though, so I cannot see the text on the white Todoist theme.",
Mostly good experience with a few bugs here and there with reminders. I also like the API they provide that allows me to write some custom integrations for personal use.,
"I am satisfied with using this, but the task list widget sometimes does not work properly and freezes or works slowly, for example, after selecting completed tasks. I hope that the problems of the widget will be fixed in the next updates",
"Paying to see the completed tasks clearly shows poor pricing strategy. Charging makes sense for more advances features like... Collaboration, Repeat Reminders etc but not for checking you own completed tasks for a given day or week etc.",
"I love this app . It's Practical and useful . The project thing is soo good . I make projects like someday/ maybe , 2021 goals and routine.. Labels are also good. I would have been happier with one time payment. Make a notes app next .üòÉ Edit : For those who forget , put that big widget on your home screen üòé Pls improve your widget",
"Love everything about this app and its functionality. Only snag I've ran into is my task items not updating to the correct times after daylight savings. Love that I can simply type ""daily at 4pm"" and the app knows what to do!",
"Makes it easy to keep track of everything I want get done, helps break it down and keep track of progress, and stay focused on top priorities until they are completed.",
"Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none.",
an amazing app that has really helped me get my life together and organized,
Great app. I am just using the free version. This app is a great place to put all the things i think of during the day that I need to do. Its super convenient to use. I also enjoy the karma part of the app that rewards you for checking off tasks,
"Reminders require pro (paid) version. Even then, there is no opstion to snooze at a different time. UI and UX feels confusing and non intuitive.",
"So far, so good. Love the encouragement in teaching daily goals. Shows overdue and can reschedule items. A personal assistant. With ADHD, need that. Less stress. Thx!",
Pathethic! you have to pay to get a basic feature such as reminders on your phone! Reminders should be free as it's basic core requirements for any to-do app. Happy to have switched to TickTick app with reminders etc all for free!,
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain",
Easy to use. Clean interface. Does exactly what a todo list should do. My wife and I use it to help run our small business. The sharing feature is wonderful.,
"No easy to use, all features I need like reminders and labels in expensive version ($36). Not going to put out that kind of money, when can't even figure out how to use it.",
"Good App. Unfortunately, some of the features that I would like to use such as the list of tasks completed and their analysis are in premium / paid version.",
Makes day to day tasks easier to remember and adding to the list is easy with auto recognition of date formats and tags. I can't say enough about how helpful it's been to help me get organized and make my day calmer.,
"Hate the fixed days off setting b/c I work very irregular shifts. Uninstalled. EDIT: to dev response - irregular means different days every week. Far too complicated to bother. Perhaps add option to switch this off entirely, ""forcing"" it just makes things too complicated.",
"Sadly this app is no longer usable. The notifications have stopped working and I am even unsure if this is a ""paid"" feature now. I followed all previous advice I could find from todoist and from general android sources. Either way after an hour or trying I have to leave for another app until the notifications start working.",
Everything is simple and convenient. But there needs to be an activity log or completed task section. Not being able to track the completed tasks is a dealbreaker.,
"Using this app for atleast 5+ yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature !! I mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but that's unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start. Goodbye Todoist Edit (after reply): So you mean, me & every other person who is complaining are all wrong. Reminders were never premium until some time ago. I was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan. Have courtesy to not lie atleast :(",
"If you like checking boxes off, this is a great app. You can create lists, sublists, and even nest tasks inside of a list. It's a great organizational list app.",
"The app automatically hides completed tasks, making it practically unusable if you want to be able to track what steps you've completed with out having to actively look for them every single time you move between projects.",
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS! I used it for one month, and now that I have gone through the cancelation procedure 3 times, I am still being charged. No humans to reach to, try to put in a ticket for contact, and all it is is a circle of ignorance an frustration. Again, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.",
"Thought it needed my email just for an account. Won't stop sending me spam messages to do my tasks! Uninstalled weeks ago and still sends me messages. Don't recommend this at all, would rather use Microsoft or Google tasks.",
"It's very very costly for individual use .Can you roll out premium for Individual and family plan, instead of only team of upto 25people support? This would make it worth for user like me who uses this app for individual use and not for team level tracking",
Spent a solid 30 minutes trying to figure out how to make a task repeat. Very unintuitive layout.,
"I used to have an issue with the calendar, but now it is sorted üëç Now I cannot imagine managing my task without todoist. It is easy to use and it helped me a lot, thanks for the great application.",
I love this app and tried to buy the pro version but unfortunately I can't because nomatter what account I use to download the app or which one I sign into the app will only sign into the one account with payment problems. I wish I could sign into a different one to buy the paid upgrade,
"A really great app. It has a built in calendar, reminders, priorities and labels. It's significantly improved my list making.",
Great app! We share the shopping list. So it's easy for whoever goes shopping! Simply ask Google to add items to your list or add manually. I mainly on use the shopping tab.,
"Flexible enough to accommodate many styles. we share some ""projects"" across the whole family like the shopping list so we always know the latest need or if someone has picked something up already. Also great for organizing personal a d professional projects.",
"Turned around my productivity life, slowly but surely. It's all in how you use it: I recommend starting slow with a couple tasks a day that you already do and then slowly adding things you find you need to do. Clean interface and helpful karma system.",
l got it just for the connection with google assistant and have tried multiple times to get it to work with it but it continues to say TODOIST ISNT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW I am sooo frustrated and dissapointed. l hope this can be fixed l was really considering the paid version before l found out it didn't work at all with my google assistant or google home.,
My experience have been good. The app is simple and convenient to keep u on task. But it could have been better and therefore i have given 4 stars because I want a not to do list in this app to keep myself lazer focused on my ultimate goal.,
"I can't swipe right or tick a job as done from the options since latest update! what on earth have you done that for?! Now it seems I can only complete a job using that tiny, fiddley little circle. Not a good update.",
"Fantastic app; and the recent Foundations update made it even better. Great design, wonderful free functionality, good power user options, quick interface. I'm very happy. Thanks Todoist team!",
Great app for short-term and long-term checklists. Extremely helpful with task-activation and motivation when used thoughtfully. I recommend opting for premium.,
"It's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8AM or 10PM. If there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app, I'd give it a 5 star",
"Nice app! Even better in the premium option. However, I still have this phases when I don't fill in any tasks... My bad! But I'll try to become more organized, bc then todoist is a gamechanger",
"Useful, especially for setting recurring tasks (like watering houseplants, cleaning the fridge etc.). I love that you can set up projects to share tasks too.",
"I tried so hard but no. Grouping tasks as ""today"" in a ""Today"" list is not a clean design. I know there is some years of work on this, but app is becoming another Winamp.",
great for helping break down tasks and keeping track of progress. wish it didnt try to make me pay to set certain alarms weekly but I can always do that myself ig.,
"Great app. But I have a problem. When the phone is not working, the sound of a completed task is heard. And if I restart my phone, this problem doesn't occur until I open the app again.",
"They kept updating the system to make it worse and slower, eg instead of clicking I now have to alt click. I LOVE it when my external brain is proprietary SaaS that I get to rent but have no control over.",
What gives you as much flexibility as you need: + projects to grope tasks + lables + powerful filters alow you to create you personal views But: - it is possible to syncronize ONLY one google calendar!!! (which is funny as for Editor's choice app) - it is not possible to grope labels to set common color or search pattern - it is not possible to label a project so that all tasks created in a project get this label. I hole guys will fix the issue with calender otherwise all props do not worth it.,
"Ive been using this app for a long time now, fairly consistently and I find it very helpful for organizing. Its much faster and easier to make notes and get things done its great!",
"it's great! I can add all of my chores on their necessary dates and it always reminds me. as a scatterbrain who also has high expectations for myself, this helps me manage both tendencies.",
Used it for 5 minutes. This app does not have the ability to have your reminder repeat hourly daily weekly monthly yearly. It has none of that. How can you not have a repeat function? You guys don't think that people want to be reminded of things on a weekly basis or a daily basis or monthly basis or yearly basis?,
Was great until I switched to a Galaxy S22+. Now I get notifications up to 45 minutes late. Not very good for an app that should give you a reminder on time. Setting new notifications is wonky too.,
"Throw anything into the Inbox, to sort later (or right away) using Priority, Schedule (with reminders), Labels and Projects ""folders"". Set up a workflow that suits you any it's very helpful and simple to use!",
I like the design and speed of the app But some features are behind a pay wall that are very helpful ( but they need to get money someway right ) The only thing that i dont like about the app is that its not possible to schedule repeting tasks,
"It's great to have a separate app for todo lists that's always super fast, simple and reliable! Great features for organizing: time plan, projects, sections!",
"Todoist improves on everything I never thought you could improve on with Todo list apps. A beautiful UI with no gimmicks, plus features I didn't even know I needed. I really love it.",
"This app has really help me keep myself organised. The option to share tasks is also great - whether used for grocerie shopping, work projects or even holidays - it just makes coordinating plans so much easier! Love this app!",
"This has helped me become more productive than I thought I could be. The projects are immensely helpful when it comes to organizing what you have to do for what tasks, and it gives you a notification every day you have tasks, so you don't forget. It really helps productivity become more of a lifestyle, rather than a hobby. 5 stars!",
"Best to do app I've tried including original Wunderlist. Premium well worth it. UPDATE: Please increase the 300 task limit if possible. Annoying to have to fix at times. Plus being the premium version, it should be over that max allowment. Thanks!",
"Update 2: My question is solved for now. Thanks. I think it was just some delay because of holidays. Update:Ticket id 566206 I like the functionality of the app. I've been using it for more than a year. But: Do you have a support team? I created a ticket on Jan, 3d but my question is still neither solved nor even answered.",
"Love it. Priorities are here, tasks done are recorded, and just everything u need for a to-do list app. Thank you developer! Highly Recommend.",
"After recent updates. The homescreen widget stopped functioning. It would only work if app is running in background. If app is killed from recent sis apps, the widget stops working.",
"Very efficient app, a real time-saver ! And since the last update, a new widget extremely well-made and customizable : you don't even need to actually open the app !",
"Subscription required to set reminders? That's basic functionality for a To Do app. The app looks nice, and some features would be worth the subscription.",
"This app has saved my life at work and in my personal life. It's so easy to use, great interface both on phone and desktop app. Brings me joy and lessens my anxiety!",
It's a great app for the one's who don't want to waste their very single moments in this life. It's helpful in achieving goals and to increase productivity in your daily life. Thank you so much to #Doist. Keep moving forward ‚ô•Ô∏è,
"Works great! Multi-platform, great for establishing workflow and scheduling. Love it! Has made a significant improvement in how I manage my personal life and priorities.",
Sort by priority works differently now. It's only temporary and that's not what I need. If I add 10 new tasks with priority I don't want to change the order for all tasks manually.,
"Great app! User interface is smooth. Only minor gripe is that some options are a little more hidden than I'd like to see, so takes a little getting use to.",
Effortless to add and maintain tasks and to-do lists. I am planning on combining this with Evernote but Todoist often makes it feel like it's more than enough for organising my daily activities.,
"I just want to say thank you so much. My mental health has not been this good since I was a teenager. I am finally able to keep track of all the things that usually end up piling on top and smothering me until i feel hopeless. This is an amazing app. I have tried several other similar ones, but this does exactly what I need with such a simple interface. I wish the developers all the good fortune in the world!",
"Beautiful todo list app with almost all the features i need except for reminders which is only limited to paid plans. Overall, a great todo app with minimal design and excellent customer support.",
You have started making it worse. You killed the fun and satisfaction of swiping and checking off the task completely out of the screen by boomeranging it back while swiping. Looks like I have to develop a Minimalist To Do app on my own.,
"Great app! Would be nice if a note function can be added to any date as an option instead of task. By doing so, users can not only add tasks but notes of the day too.",
I purchased a premium but in the app it doesn't allow me to create more than 5 projects and it says upgrade to premium. This is rediculous. The funny part is when I click on upgrade to premium again it says you have it already. I want a full refund.,
Was sceptical about this app when someone told me about it but now it has replaced my notebook and I've converted to the paid version! Really easy to use and quick to add items.,
"Being a developer myself i use this app every day and its awesome. Email alerts, push notifications and more just make it sweeter. On top of that I cant stare at bright and vibrant windows all day and seeing that they took people like me into account with a dark mode is just awesome. Thank you guys keep up the good work!",
Only used it for 2 days but really wish I could see all the accomplished tasks that were scratch off. It's a basic to do list app and nothing more unless you pay for the premiums.,
Overall I like the app. However a large frustration is that showing completed tasks resets on switching views. Please add this. Visual confirmation is a hugehelp to productivity.,
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving.",
"Task apps have come a long way. Use across Mac os, iPad and Android. Really love this app, simple to use, categorise, file, date, action, etc and syncs seamlessly. Paid for premium student option",
"the app is good and easy to use. it will send you email reminders and overdue task. too bad for more useful functions, you will have to pay for it. but it is still useful as is.",
"Its really not clear how to set recurring tasks, which is the reason I chose this to do app as apparently it could. I've read the help guide and still can't work it out.",
"Great app, good at keeping you accountable and productive. Would be nice to be able to re-order your to-dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done",
"This is the best personal productivity app in the marketplace. Its usability is top notch, its design and flow is smooth and customizable. Its API is a delight to use as an integration-savvy consumer. I trust todoist to be the brains of my family life and even sometimes my career life.",
"Great app! So easy to use, keep everything organised with reminders so I don't have to think. The widget keeps me up to date with what needs doing today. So many great little features!",
"Support is terible even on paid subscription: due to some problem with sinhronisation with todoist's servers (it was writen in the sistem message in the app) I've lost data for the whole evening of planing for two weeks ahead. I have mailed to support (648200) - no response in 24h. So, since I have to continue planning things, now I basicaly forsed to redo all planing manualy without understaning the reason of the problem and any insuranse, that next time, I will need help, it will be provided.",
"An amazing app to plan daily & shleduled tasks, goals as well as projects. Easy & user friendly UI. Whether user just wants to note some random tasks or very specific scheduled tasks & projects; it's useful.",
"The best todo app in my opinion. The filters, search, available on all platforms I can think of, and ease of use. Thank you todoist!",
Easy and quick to use. An ideal companion for task management using the additional tools you get with the subscription. Thanks :),
This is a great app. One thing I suggest is time ranges. Im getting a bit frustrated with the fact that I cant make an appointment from say 2:00pm to 4:30pm for example. It would help to have time blocks to visualize my schedule. Would this be possible?,
"Not intuitive or easy to use. Has great features built in, but actually being able to learn how to use the app is very clunky and off putting.",
"I would really love to see a pomodoro timer, habit tracker, and a kanban board. The subtasks management could be better as it is in TickTick. I really love how Todoist have 2-way Google calendar sync.",
I love the way you can set priority levels for tasks !,
"Great app, but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder, it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder. I appreciate that, becouse no one will give you his work as a free. Ok, i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which I need.",
Super helpful. It's easy to add tasks to any category or sub category and assign them to an individual all in one step. Helps me and my husband keep track of what needs done and how busy the other person is.,
It would be so great if they add a calendar to this app,
"Very easy to use, I like using the widget on the screen and always write by myself the day and hour (which transform automatically by the app). Recommend it!",
great app! Allows to track my tasks very flexible way,
"Really, I have to try for hours to create a password to delete this app? And there is no way to do it.",
Ok so reason it's not 5 stars is because of one thing that I'd like as a feature and that is to change the colour of priorities as this would be an aesthetic thing I'd enjoy. Other than that extremely good for organisation and motivation.,
"My previous review seems to have been deleted. I don't need to have my schedule fed to Google. A sheet of paper is all that I need. There is even a GTD app in book form, probably for the same reason. Uninstalled, but that didn't stop the spamming.",
"USER BE WARE:if you want timely reminders of what you need to DO that you put in your TODO app.Per task notifications are behind a paywall! Bulk reminders in the morning and evening does not alleviate the issue.I need this so I don't forget what to do WHEN I have to do it!And that's what's happening,because the devs don't think that BASIC notification feature parity that every.other.free.app.has.should be free.Why even let me set a time!? +1 star for fine UI,webapp,and handy NLP ig. What a joke.",
"Buggy. Widget unresponsive, selecting a project overrides with inbox when you type ""everyday"". Sometimes.",
"Works great, easy to move unfinished tasks. why the 3? because they want 3 dollars a month to review completed tasks. there are others out there that don't charge.",
Really good app but recently iam seeing a lot of bugs like - when I am adding task it is not getting added . Projects are getting created randomly which is very irritating. Other than this it is 5 ‚≠ê,
"Real useful to organise tasks by project so I can sort my work from my home, and I can also sort by priority, who it's assigned to, due dates etc. Glad it syncs across devices and can work offline too. I'm loving the widget to see all your lists from your phone home screen.",
"What a pointless app. I had to google how to set recurring daily tasks, and then it didn't actually remind me at the times i set. I'll get a pen and notepad and write an actual to-do list next time",
"It is a phenomenal app, I have just one suggestion, can you make the repeating sub-tasks not appear on the main list, it clogs up the interface.",
its minimalist style is so nice and simple to understand and it has a lot of options as well to organize and prioritize and various options to help you get more focused and your to dos,
"Very easy to use with a simple interface and plenty of features. The web version syncs with the app, and is just as easy to use. I'm more productive already.",
I had a bad time with time Management at work and at home. Now with my samsung and the routines I can get up this is the first app that wakes up in the morning. Giving me an opportunity to set up the day how I want and check them off as they're done.,
Easy to add and monitor tasks. Projects are a collection of related small tasks making the whole thing seem less daunting. Synchs PC to smartphone to smartwatch seamlessly.,
Amazing app. Keeps me updated with all the tasks I have to do and when they are Or will be overdue. Really like the project feature so we can seperate the kind of tasks.,
"There is a sort function, but each time i made amendment or add item, it will not sort automatically and i need to manually press sort again in order to have clear view of my outstanding item according to urgency.",
Great app for staying organized. I share it with my husband and we organize our tasks together as a team. The articles and templates are helpful for making the most out of the app.,
"Amazing app, the premium experience offers the entire app but even without you have enough to track tasks and the satisfaction of ticking it off the large list of things needed to be done.. To the devs, great work can't wait for any updates I'm a fan forever and what ever device I might get next will have this app",
"its really good. you can schedule tasks, and create projects and goals. but if you just want an app to remind you that its time to dk a specific task, you can do that too.",
"So far so good. I like the projects and sub task features especially. Only been actively using for about a week. Great for todos, not totally sold for checklisting yet.",
Pretty good. Sync to calendar not easy to figure out. Similar to Wanderlist but better. But could use some features like Microsoft ToDo.,
It's really awesome and very helpful. It would reach more and more people if the premium version is available at a little lesser price. Appreciate the Todoist team. Thank you.,
"This app is very helpful. And I have only been using this app for some weeks. And It can help me for everything I need to do in life like school, meetings, taking notes and more. But I just wish it had a calendar. But I still love it!‚ù§Ô∏è",
"***Update*** The app is working perfect on both web, phone app and Chromebook app. The AI is very intuitive and once you learn small nuances, it is the best To Do list / Reminder on the market.",
"The integration with Alexa is a big benefit. I can sit on the couch, think of my projects and dictate tasks. Next 7 day recap is available on my phone, tablet and PC, great stuff!",
"I'm really enjoying using Todoist so far. I've used lots of productivity apps, and this one tops the list for me in terms of organising my daily and weekly to-do lists.",
Awesome App. For first time in my life I feel in control. Projects is great idea. So easy to add tasks and schedule them with natural language processing. Big thumbs up for the team.,
"I keep this on the home screen of my phone, and look at it more than I do my daily planner. It's user friendly, easy graphically, and helps me stay very organized with all that I have to do for my day and work.",
"Good for small lists and limited organizing. A limited and greedy platform. An app that requires a subscription, but should use a sold pro version. Idk who pays for this as a subscription but they are over valuing the seevice.",
This is a great product that helps to keep my life organized. I love how I can add tasks and projects with ease and can mark them off easily as well. I would always recommend that people use apps like this.,
I'm using Todoist to organize all my projects hobbies chores and I even set up a task list for my next batch of beer everything from buying my ingredients to bottling. it works so great. I love the widget I can see what I have scheduled and check them off without opening the app and finding the task. Haven't had it set up to share projects yet but soon.,
"Really intuitive, much easier and simpler to use than some other to-do apps I have tried! I immediately upgraded to premium and it was very affordable.",
"Please fix the bug that automatically toggles ""reset recurring subtasks"" on every time I open the app! So frustrating to mark off ""chores"" (daily) & have 57 completed tasks repopulated as past due!",
"You have to buy premium to set an alarm for the reminders, otherwise it emails it to you, which is bullcrap. It also refuses to save a specific time for the reminder to be sent",
I *love* this app [esspeciakly as a Nerodivergent person] My brain doesn't work with traditional calendars cause there's no objective you don't finish a task this enables organization for my scatter brain cause I go in and check off what I'm doing when it's done so doctor apt gets checked off so I can avoid over booking cause it's in my to do list while also remembering the stuff thats not strictly timed just needs done,
Great app! I use it to keep track of work projects and my tasks for courses I take for my masters. The free version is perfect enough for what I use it for.,
This is a very good app for note taking but i deleted it because i found another app. When i unistalled it it still kept sending me emails saying that i have some tasks pending. Even after 1 month i still get emails. Please fix this issue,
A great way to keep track of honey do lists. We just had our first child and both my wife and I are mentally exhausted so it is easy to let things slip through the cracks. The shared project is great for us to communicate even if we are on different sleep schedules. I just wish there was a way to pin the current project to be the first thing that opens up instead of the daily view of the current day. Would definitely recommend.,
"This app is great, designed well, powerful and easy to use. I don't regret upgrading one bit. I think the karma stuff is unnecessary, but I'm glad I can just disable it. Keep it up. ü§ô",
"Awesome app, but... Sharing is borked on Android 13",
"Just beginning to use it, as Premium, and I,m really happy. It,s, up to now, the only app of its kind which fulfills my label, filters, functions, etc needs and, wow, allows me to personalise them!",
"One of the first things you notice, Todoist app feels like it really DID have effort put into it by devs and not to just find another way or place to inject an ad in, but to make money by actually making the app GOOD.. it feels like the devs themselves DO use the app, it''s like they made it for themselves - usable and functioning, because they couldn't find anything on googlestore that's practically usable for task management, and then they marketed it because others probably feel the same. . That's what a good dev is - make product actually good and money comes flowing naturally, and you don't need to hide your guilt by excuses",
"Without knowing anything about the app it forces you to create/connect an online account first. After that for the reminder app to send you reminders, you need to pay for a subscription not even a one time fee. What a joke!",
"After searching through loads of Todo list apps finally found one that works for me, great interface, very customiseable, sad that some features are locked behind premium but works fine for free",
"I've been using it for about a week & it has some nice capabilities, although I wish there was a cheaper offer for premium. Also, some of the functionality is a little difficult to figure out, but you get used to it.",
"Completed tasks are hidden from the default view. There is no way to enable them. This used to be possible, but it was removed for some reason. Not being able to easily tell what has already been done defeats the purpose of a todo app.",
"Loving this to do app so far. Intutive, easy to use interface with just the right set of features. Would recommend it for your to do lists",
"Took a minute to figure out the terminology, but once I did, the literal best app I have on my phone. This is only the second app I've felt strongly enough about to take a minute to write a review. It's good. You need todoist. Period.",
"Not the most features, but probably the most balanced of the to-do list apps. Sync and speed are very robust.",
Some really critical features missing like start time support. I won't want to look at a task all day that I have no ability to complete until later. It needlessly creates a feeling of unproductiveness when you're list is larger than the reality of the tasks justify.,
Just on the basic unpaid version and loving it. Perfect to keep track of everything with baby brain right now. The paid version seems pretty good too and might upgrade once I'm back to work,
Pretty cool way to organize my life. Lots of options for sorting tasks into groups and having different colors to label priority. Really helped me get some much needed order in the chaos of my life.,
Not happy with this app. Saying that reminder is a premium feature and we have to pay for that. Then what is the difference between this app and the phone calendar app? I prefer to use my phone calendar app as it has all the features such as reminder. Uninstall your app by the way. It is useless.,
"shortcuts to quick actions like add task and search have disappeared in last version. edit: no response from the developers, changing the review to 1 star edit 2: developer replied with a link to instructions, which helped: log out and log in again. changed rating to 5 stars.",
"Removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version, and the price is way to high. looking elsewhere :-(",
"This app is so much easier to collaborate with my team(s) on deadlines, details, and new jobs. . I've used other apps designed for developers that are too complicated for teams in different industries. I set my boss up with this app and it's helped organize his freelance clientele so much. We can always be updated on new clients and a checklist of what needs to be done. Todist is now a daily tool in my personal life too. üëç",
The best part is it is able to sync perfectly with my galaxy watch 4 unlike many other Todo apps.other apps i tried they wud not update phone app when i mark a task from the watch.but i just wish the buttons & fonts could be a bit smaller.,
"Came here from Wunderlist. Seems that Wunderlist had most of the features for free that this app requires premium for. However, I love the smart-date feature and cross platform sync. Great app!",
"Superb app. Simple and uncluttered, but packed with features and versatility. Continuous improvement with incremental updates and tweaks.",
this app really helped me improve my time management skills and overall stress levels. I found writing even the smallest tasks gave me the motivation to keep going!,
"Good free to do list. I like that it's shareable so you can coordinate with employers/employees. Haven't seen any ads, so that's definitely a plus!",
Todoist rules because they stick with what they're good at and don't clutter up the app with a bunch of half-@$$ed junk. Todoist is not a Swiss Army Knife. It's a perfectly honed chef's knife and you'll use it all the time.,
The app is organized and easy to use. A good amount of settings easy to find what you need. Writing a note is fun because of the design intuitive.,
"This app has blown me away! Rarely if ever rate an app, but there are no ads, and the free version is still incredibly highly functional... Just so impressed- well done to the team!",
Best to do list app out there. I've used other similar apps but they are either way too overloaded with features or just too basic. Todoist has got the balance right.,
"Apart from the emails (which you can probably turn off), I really like this app. It helps me to set small goals for each day, thus working towards a larger goal.",
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly.",
"The best, most responsive task manager app I have come across",
"1) Why are you disabling enter key's next line function? When I click enter key, ""Next line"" does NOT come. So I used other apps to type with new lines by using enter key. 2) Now when I cut and paste the exact contents from another app, even then, it does NOT appear line by line. It appears as a paragraph.",
I'm boring of that. On every new update Todoist team fix a bug and at the same time it create new bugs. Some section task deleted after 2-3 seconds of their creation... Please help me this make Todoist unreliable...I'm a royal premium member for many months... Please fix it...And prease review well the code before any update... I will change my rating after the fix thank you.,
"To-doist has been excellent for keeping my busy life organized! As a graduate student with a part time business, an internship, and multiple relationships being able to keep all of my pressing tasks organized and accessible is absolutely necessary to me staying on track.",
"App used to be good, used it for chores and household tasks. Now the Today page no longer shows which Project and/or Section a task is listed under (I have a Cleaning project with Sections for each room). So now I have two ""Clean sink"" tasks in my Today page, and I wouldn't know which two sinks it's referring to. Master bathroom sink? Guest bathroom sink? Kitchen sink? Really annoying, I have to now click on them to find out. Bring back the label that showed each task's Project and Section.",
A very good apps. It helps me a lot when it comes into managing my time. I love the features where I can set time by simply typing at 8pm for example. Good job developer,
This app is sooooo helpful for me as a student to help me stay focused and productive. It gives little reminders to get you back on track and it's a must for any student or busy person,
"It just is amazing. Its simple, tasks can be shared and also the way you wish to use it. It does boost your progress with the points system.",
"I have all my notes, tasks and little informations there and I've not experienced any bugs or disappointment where they'll vanish of a sudden. I trust this app and it's very good.",
It hS to be printable to be fully functionable and interaction with Google Calendar would be a plus. But it hax to be printable !!!!!!!-- Must be able to record activities and call them up for verification,
"Company got ridiculously greedy and started enforcing some really dumb rules on free accounts. Sad that I'll need to find a new solution for todo lists. Avoid this one. They randomly unshared a lot of lists me and my husband had and even deleted some, so we just lost a ton of data without warning.",
Great app! I love the projects portion that allows you to organize when you have the time. Plus the quick task that sends tasks straight to an inbox.,
I'm completely hooked to this app primarily because of the ease of adding tasks using natural language. Also the organization of tasks is simple yet effective. It has become a must have for me within a few days.,
"I absolutely love this app. It's gorgeously designed, so incredibly responsive and just EASY. I've used a ton of productivity apps and this one is the best by a mile. Your design and development teams have done a wonderful job. Thank you!",
"I encountered a small issue with the app not working correctly. After contacting the developers, they responded within 24 hours that a fix was already identified and planned to come out that week. Awesome service!",
"Was great until last update, widget scrolling is not smooth, scrolls back to the top after full scrolling. Marking tasks complete is really laggy, mostly end up clicking the wrong task.",
"First impression: when sending (via share) an item from another app to Todoist, it wants to create a separate item for each line of text üò´ and the confirmation message still has the {count} placeholder in it üòÇ Next, if you want to set an actual reminder for your first task, you have to upgrade to a $3/month subscription first üòÇüòÇüòÇ",
"i likd it but i think , u should not erase the entire task when its done. it should be in the app , in a done list folder . also , u should add a confirm button when.. we r going to mark the task done.. coz thers a chance of erasing the task accidentally as all it takes is a click",
"Almost perfect but unable to add tasks on top of the list. Tasks are always appened at the bottom, annoying! There should be an option to configure this",
It's a very good app. It helps me stay on schedule and isn't annoying about it. It also has a very good UI that doesn't look cluttered. Would definitely recommend,
"Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally",
"Borderline useless support. Came highly recommended and, in trying to learn about some functionality, I used FAQs to limited avail and then emailed. What a waste of time.",
"This app is moving towards the garbage heap. The free tier is a laughable insult now, it barely qualifies as a trial, completely unusable. If you're looking for a todo app, try elsewhere, like zenkit or notion. To top it off, the new android redesign is an unmitigated disaster. Steer clear.",
"great app. I would like a bit more convenient reminder system. For example, insead of having to write the reminder, we can have instant reminder options",
"Another simple app with a subscription plan... This is not the right strategy to attract more people... This kind of app should be a one time payment no more. Whatever the number of apps with this strategy, it doesn't make it a good one.",
"I absolutely love todoist. It is such a game changer! Makes my life so much easier, I would be lost without it. The app is awesome, very user friendly and straight forward.",
"Feedback: love this app. One thing thats annoying is that my lists don't get synced between my pc and the todoist widget. I have to open the app, and then it syncs",
Was 5 stars lowering to 2 so hopefully they see this - make the completed tasks section it's own thing again why would I want it merged with my existing tasks? Makes it very hard to find accidentally closed tasks or to look thru historical data. Dont think this change was necessary,
"Is there a way to rollback previous UI? The new UI introduces more clicks for the same action - which decrease my productivity. If I need to modify the name and due date for the same task, I need to save twice instead of one time(previous design)",
"Signed up for premium. Asked about integrating Todoist into my Gmail and Slack workflow. It took 8 days for the customer service to respond, just so they could tell me it wasn't possible. No helpful suggestions. No work around. They might have well have said ""hey thanks wasting your money with us."" What a waste.",
"It almost perfect, it is missing a selection tool, where you can select more than task and delete them at once, also there is no way I can turn a normal task to a sub task to other normal task",
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited.",
"In a world that follows the 80/20 rule, this app has gone well beyond 80%. Attention was paid to the details!",
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!",
"Seems pretty good, but totally crippled the free version by not allowing reminder notifications. What's the point without those? Not bothering with it.",
"to those who struggle with the checkbox and general widget issues (or other problems): google ""todoist 13.5 apk"" to find a verison that works better. latest version is completely unusable and destroys my wohle todoist workflow",
"Great if you don't mind paying a monthly subscription fee. Don't bother with the free version, even simple reminders are behind the pay wall..",
"In the latest update, filters don't work. Please solve this problem. Following the response to the original review. I logged out and login back and the problem is gone now. Thanks to Doist inc for the help.",
"Amazing product! no idea how i got through my weeks without it. saved my many times, cuz I'm forgetful and this keeps me organized with tasks, on each day, what priority they are.",
Very useful for capturing ideas on the go and reminding me I have to do them. 10/10 excellent functionality and speed. Very easy to use,
"I have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating. Before applying the update, I had hoped to find documentation about changes. Found nothing on the todoist website, no comments in reviews. Update is attempting to be pushed, where's the documentation????",
A great app for task keeping one of if not the best one available My only request is to have an auto refesh function for the widget as it wont update unless the app is specifically opened,
would be nice to have some things ability to set a time estimate for a task then show if time estimates for a day go over your working hours in the day or something. helping you to organize tasks and set realistic expectations for getting things done. would be optional to use,
I like that you build up a score as you complete tasks. The email/push notification options are helpful for when life gets hectic.,
"Quite a great app Keeps me updated, easy to work with and optionalize features such as the colour of the background Great for someone that can't keep an organized planner or too much to remember",
Free version is useless. I don't recommend buying something you can't try. Most of the basic features like reminders are not available in demo.,
"Reminders are a premium feature, which is what I needed this app for. It really sucks that I can't use reminders for free. I have to continue the search for a good reminders app.",
With latest version shared boards don't sync between devices. Update (2021-03-01) - for some reason now it syncs shared dashboard again. Great app very usefull.,
"Overall, I like the app but I think it can be easier to schedule reminders and the integration with Outlook does not work.",
"It's really nice but I wish the notifications were better, like for some reason I don't get notified even though the task is due. It would also be good if we can add URLs beneath the name of the task, so that we can directly visit the link.",
This app is changing my life. I feel so much better about myself. It is wonderful to be able to complete planned tasks and this app really helps to manage procrastination in a non-intrusive manner ‚ù§,
The new widget made the app almost unusable for me. Not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way.,
Several features are limited if you don't have the premium version but it's still really useful. I use the widget on my homescreen very often.,
"It is the best To do manager I've ever used. Simple yet powerful, it elegantly helps me keep on track every day. I've been using it for years and would highly recommend it!",
The app is great because it's cross-platform solution and has a lot of useful features. My only advice is that the shift between projects could be easier.,
"IS THERE A WAY THAT I CAN GET A REFUND FOR MY FRESHLY RENEWED SUBSCRIPTION???? I have used this app for over a year and when my subscription came up for renewal, it stopped syncing accross platforms from my PC to my Android phone.   No solution! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",
"This the best and is very customisable at its every level. But I didn't like that blocked reminder for pro plans which big letoff, other integration should be reserved for pro plans but reminder should be made available.",
"The app sounded great, but the fact that the primary feature, REMINDERS, is a premium feature, is ridiculous. Don't bother downloading if you want a functional app.",
"I love this app!! It is very essential to my every day life!! I am a huge procrastinator, and this app is helping me break this habit for good! I also love the rewards you get for finishing your task as planned!",
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package.",
"Early days, but so far it's doing everything I wanted & looks to have plenty more potential. I love the calendar integration particularly.",
I just updated to the latest Android version and now no tasks appear on my filters. But it's fine through the web browser. This was very good before this.,
"Easy to use, quick way to and and organise your tasks. Support of filters, labels, subtasks, projects and many other options to help you get everything done.",
Great app but the fact I can't see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if I'm free on specific day in the future insteas I need to check week by week is a deal breaker although I did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible. Will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app.,
"Get Todoist to Get Things Done ! Over past few years I have used multiple applications in the market. I Some of them being.. any.do, wunderlist, Google tasks, Google Keep, Trello and many more. After trying all of them, I came back to Todoist and became a paid member. For past 02 years Todoist has helped me getting things done and ensured that I am not missing out on important task at work and at home. Todoist is very generous in extending premium codes even for already premium users!",
"I really like this program, it's been very helpful keeping me organized. the only down side is i had to get the paid version for some of the best features but i think it was worth it.",
"Great for organizing to do items. Wish you could reset due dates in bulk, and a few other features would be nice, but overall great app.",
"Exceptional organizational tool that syncs across devices & apps, & with calendar automated reminders I never miss an important task. Part of my daily workflow. Highly recommend!",
"Easy to add tasks, looks good, just wish reminder was a free feature, but that's just me being cheap ! Great app so far, working on making it something I use daily.",
"Has really helped me boost my productivity, app is fantastic. So clean and really easy to use. If you're looking for an app to help productivity via to do lists - this is it.",
The app is great but I just need one more functionality. The ability to add every new event on the top of the list automatically. Do this and I will buy the app.,
you should disclose that your app requires a subscription in order to use it and then one must pay for it every year for the rest of their life.... this information should be displayed on the Play Store page where you sell your app .... it is my suggestion that you come up with a fair price to get paid 1 time for your app ... then it's a worthwhile apl otherwise you're wasting people's time and participating an absolute greed ...,
The only task manager app for Android and Windows with a dark theme. I also like that you can choose to focus on either due dates or individual lists.,
Pretty decent check list app. I like how you can set up reoccurring tasks. I recommend it for anyone moving away from paper planners.,
"It's a very good app... 1. But, when I deleted a task from No Section in A Project, The Entire Project Got Deleted... When I Clicked on Activity log, very Few Tasks with The Project Name Got Back... Correct It if can 2. If I Add A TASK, If I click send in my keyboard rather than arrow key in todoist, TASK will automatically move into a no section column instead of where ( a named section ) I typed it",
"This UX is amazing. Unload your thoughts when you have them, organize them when you get a second. Infinitely flexible. Get it done.",
best to do app EVER . been using it for years . fast interface and looks fantastic . does everything I need it to. would rate 10 if I could,
"Latest update has fixed the irritating issue where when you completed a task a floating box appeared over your other tasks, preventing you from selecting them. Thank you!",
Finding myself using this app a lot more than I thought. I'm not a very stoic/organised person but the app keeps pushing me to complete the daily tasks I have set and that's good for this guy. Great app. Keep it up,
"I was so overwhelmed and stressed out at work all the time before I discovered Todoist. Once I started using it, I felt like I could finally be productive. There have been several times where I've started to feel overwhelmed again, and then I realize how I could use Todoist to manage everything. It always works. I love this app, and I don't know how I would function without it. I tell everyone I know about it.",
It's a great app but it doesn't work because it keeps crashing all the time so almost impossible to use the app Edit: it seems to be fixed after the update,
"Wish the app suggests emojis based on the task you write. But other than that this app is an absolute game changers for me, it is unbelievable how this app can integrate with sooo many apps like google calander, trello, edge, notion .... This is the best To Do list app ever.",
"For sure, this app is good enough, but! After a year of usage they added reminder feature to a premium access. Without reminders your app is useless. Thanks a lot. Even comments went to premium. Completely useless app.",
"Great for people that like lists, I have the free version and it does enough to keep me satisfied. I'm sure there's much more to discover in the paid version but for my use case this is fine",
The app and the web version are not in sync. It's been a few days. Task that have been completed on the app are still on the web version.,
"Horrible experience Your team is incapable of good UI design. A normal low end developer could creat beautiful UI. Calander view is outdated,and useless.cant get any information from it. Can't even see subtasks attached to main task in main view. Worthless, outdated app.is your CEO sleeping or has enough money? Such a stupid, outdated design",
Great app for tracking tasks! Love the scheduling feature. I just started using it so I look forward to realizing its full potential!,
No reminder in the free version. A great downside of not using this app. I've been using other to-do planner and never had to pay to remind me.,
This is a cross platform we can create many projects. So do list is a very useful app every day. There are many different benefits of this app. All people should be used this app and fil good life,
"There is a bug with recurring tasks. If a task is overdue and it is supposed to reccur on the next day (today), the yesterday task stays as overdue and new task for today won't be there. If I had completed the task yesterday but I did not marked it done, I will have to reschedule the task for today instead of marking it done. If I mark it done instead, the yesterday task is completed and today's task does not show up.",
Couldn't see how to set reoccurring tasks. Don't have time to mess around trying to find basic things. Uninstalled.,
Don't have an account with this App. Kept on sending emails to me. Kindly delete if someone has given my email id. I have nothing to do with this application,
"This app helped me become more productive; I set myself 5 goals a day and I love ticking one by one off my list. I find it really helpful how todoist does reviews of all the completed tasks, as it gives me an insight into my productivity pattern. highly recommend!",
Very intuitive to use and highly customizable. Love the integration with Google Calendar. Taking my organization level to new heights!,
"I love having a to do list and this app makes it easy to check things off my list, or move them to another date. So far I have just used the free version, but I am seriously considering upgrading. I would love to have a way to see my ""done list""",
"Best ""to do"" app I try, very intuitive interface. My day now is completely organized. Karma feature is very interesting and motivating. Thank you for this amazing app.",
Best to do list. Fav part is pin notifications,
"Great app. And love the multi-crossplatform intergrations like with google calendar and Momentum. Just wish the design was more streamlined, like Listberry, then I'll be more inclined to use",
So far i liked it if it were open source i might have added 2 or 3 features of mine as well with those features it would be all time best app for me for task management. I will change ratings when I'll get those features as well even though I am its pro user,
As some one who is extremely forgetful I find this app really helps me get things done. I like how I can separate tasks in a way that some of them give me reminders while other more long term project sit on a list I can reference myself.,
"Everything is good but I can't turn on the show completed tast option from anywhere please add it, in the next update. Edit: I want the ""Show Completed Task"" feature in today or tomorrow tasks also, not only for projects.",
"Thought it was only phone problem, but after changing phones a couple of times, app widget still gets bugged. There're times when tasks are suddenly gone, then i had to redo putting the widget. Sometimes widget can't be clicked",
"Great app. Totally enjoying the premium feature. But I wish sorting out the list stays as I set it, instead of changing the sorting out method every time I want to view.",
The automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes. It would also be nice to have a maps integration - I do not think it is there.,
It was slow to get into (lots to digest can get swamped) however now that I am taking simple steps onto it it is becoming invaluable. Looking forward to getting more out of it daily.,
Overall pretty good. Wish there was a way to skip a repating task instead of falsely completing it. The list widget is pretty useful.,
"Can't receive notifications from the app, reminders, overdue tasks, due dates all don't work. It was working fine before, but certain update broke it.",
Seems pretty good but most of the options that make if stand out are not available unless you pay for it. Splendo is cleaner and easier to use.,
An easy to use tool that helps you keep track of all those little and big things going on in life. I especially like it's flexibility for handling tasks that repeat.,
"This app has definitely helped me survive this semester. It's really helped me manage work, life and engineering school while staying sane. Granted I'm also using a calendar and a physical weekly agenda.",
I think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect! I find myself constantly going back and forth between Todoist and Google calendar to schedule my stuff! All in all a great app though,
Loved the free version so much that I upgraded to the paid version within the first week. I've never done that with any other service. Todoist keeps my family organised. Can't imagine how I ever got anything done before it üëç,
I like that it has both projects and labels and you can query across both. I like the dark mode. Colors are a nice touch.,
"This app is nice but I don't like it because it only works with internet and there are some options which only work if I pay money, I disliked this app only because of those problems. If this app not contain those two problems I have given it 5 star. Anyways Thank you",
"Really love it so far, wish they had something for repeated tasks...would have given 5star otherwise. Week 1 , very happy. #edit: Thank you for the response :). I applied what u said and it is awesome. Changing to 5 stars , would give 6 for customer service !",
I've used several to do apps. Now I'm a Todoist loyalist! Todoist does everything I need across every platform plus endless app integrations. I'm nearly a todoist grand master and I'm still finding more uses and tricks for greater productivity. Tremendous app!,
This is a really good app which greatly enhanced my ability to manage my tasks and keep track of them. I mostly use the widget and almost never open the app itself.,
This has been helpful getting organized for my job but it wont allow you to have 2 separate accounts that have nothing to do with each other. I would like a personal account separate from this one. I would pay the premium for it. My boss would have to pay the premium for this one.,
I was not into productivity apps as such because I thought that it would just complicate the whole process but this app is really minimal and has all the necessary functionalites that one might need. Perfect.,
"Good app, but it's constantly crashing these days. It's always telling me that it keeps stopping.",
"I accidentally click on something and the whole note was deleted,dint even give an option saying do you want to delete the Note :( i wrote so many notes on the desktop and accidentally clicked something on the mobile and everything was deleted, no option to undo? No recycle bin or anything. Atleast ask for confirmation, some undo option for 3seconds.Very disappointed. SIR IF YOU CAN READ WELL, I SAID I ACCIDENTALLY DELETED IT DON'T KNOW WHAT I CLICKED ON THE MOBILE APP. WHY NO CONFIRMATION",
I used to like this. Then the updated it to include something called in Inbox which is just ruining it for me. I dont need that its making it confusing to keep track of things. I will be replacing this with another app.,
"Amazing app with so many features to organize our tasks. Initially I felt the app had so many features, it's complex to use and thought this app isn't for me. But once I learnt and understood all the features of the app and how to use them I am just loving this app.",
"Really good. and has a very good widget. but I can't keep using it because you can't add pictures, drawings, or recordings.",
"its amazing so helpful I recommend it to everyone who want to be organized and have everything planned for the next day, week even month so u can know what to do at that specific time again it's amazing",
"Basic version covers almost all you need to manage tasks. The name of the app reads tasks and reminders, but you need premium to get these. Misleading",
Amazing application. I was already motivated to do a lot of things but it's just so easier to be productive when you put those things out of your mind and write them down. I really feel that I am doing more things than before. This app is for me the best Todo app. It really suits me perfectly.,
Suits my needs perfectly. Pretty easy to figure out. Even the free version makes it simple to organise tasks in a clear way!,
"This is the best to do app I can find. I love that I can set due date, priority, and project by just typing (rather than a series of a thousand clicks like with other apps). I highly recommend.",
"This app is great for productivity, however I've recently ran into syncing issues with the app and the extension on my computer and I'm not sure how I should fix it",
"Found that on the phone app, the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited (100 or 200), but on the computer version there is no such limitation. Other than that it's a good app.",
Hlw!!! Company there is bug in the latest version I can't open the app. When I downloaded the app it couldn't open and then after I reinstall it couldn't open I'm facing same problem as earlier so asap fixed the bug,
"Cant use it if notifications dont work. Wont pay if I cant full feature test.....lets take this Corolla for a test drive, we can pretend its the Supra you imagine it might be... but first pay us to find out where you were just imagining vs how it really works....lol. Too bad, genuinely need a good working product.No thanks, it always requires mindless divulging of my banking info, you cant have that, if you have a product you trust let me see it,if I like it,you can have my banking info. Lol",
"It is great, with plenty of reminders built in and works across platforms. I wish there were more gamification elements.",
Such a a fantastic and intuitive app. The level of complexity available for a free product is amazing. My productivi has increased ten fold!,
"Great sync and cross-platform - many layers of nested tasks, easy integrations. I've tried tons of these, an this is my favorite by a mile.",
"It's not a bad app but I find it too cumbersome to navigate, I would have liked a simpler display of tasks, visually and organizationally it needs work.",
"The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps.",
"I like this app more than any other task/list management app out there, mainly because it supports infinite subtasking. A hierarchical structure helps breaking down tasks.",
I use the widget quite a lot and I have found it really difficult to mark a task as completed. It requires 3-4 clicks on the tick button to mark it is complete,
Bought the paid version and added various tasks on desktop. Won't even log me in or load anything. Downloaded the app to access my tasks and shows nothing. I even paid for premium. Very dissatisfied and disputing through my bank. This is worst than free apps like keepnote. Seriously disappointed,
I have searched a multi-platform app similar to ios reminders for a long time. My search finally finished after discovering Todoist. Todoist is able to fulfill a simple requirements that no other app is able to: recurring task. Thank you to all Todoist team for such contribution,
"Excellent dynamic app, the first time a to do list has worked for me. Easy to use. Now that I can track my own performance, I just have to change my own habits ;-)",
"Great app, I'd recommend to anyone that has problem solving, and anxiety issues. It helps me sleep to be able to make todo lists for the next day.",
Love the ability to add anything I want and color code tasks for visibilty. Wish there were as many colors for tasks as there was for labels though. Still 5 stars.,
"Honestly really liked this app, was 1 of the top 2 out of several however the ""rolling"" daily tasks is what lost me. Otherwise, this is much a newer, bigger, better version of Google Tasks...which I LOVE as well, however it has no share abilities.",
"I love a list that someone gives me to complete, but making the list is no fun for me. Todist makes sense and allows me to throw ideas in the inbox to handle later. It helps me better manage what I could not...me!",
"WARNING RE THIS APP. Got Premium, followed instructions to Integrate w/calendar w/vpn active, got security alert minutes later that an attempt was made to login to my email account w/my password. Had to hustle to protect my account. Thank you Google for superb alerts, shame on you Todoist for open back doors.",
Some kinda scam to collect email address.,
"And once again, here we have another app that gets worse with every update. Over complicating things. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I get what they are trying to do, but it has made it less user friendly and more restrictive. I wish I could revert back to the previous version. Currently considering going back to the previous app I used to use.",
Widgets are so huge (4x2) that they are unusable. I wish i had an option to use smaller widgets. I have tried another to do app and it had much smaller so usable widget.,
"This app so far has helped me to be more active with the days that I'm granted. See, I'm doing this thing called ""80/20."" I'll get my work done and go reward myself for completing my daily goals. This app is exceedingly productive and keeps you motivated with the Karma System.",
Simple straight forward functionality and compatible across different devices and browsers. I use it everyday and love it.,
This app is constantly having notification issue. For 6 months this issue would come and go and now it just stay. What are you using your subscribers money for if you're not going to properly fix the problem? I will not use todoist anymore.,
"Wonderful app i can't say how much I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è A note for the developer: please add the time for the task Often times tasks are the works that need to be done.but todoist lacks one key thing that is asking the user ""How much time do you want to do the task like 10 or 30 minutes"" It's a really big problem when you look at your time blocked calender but see a half hour work which would take 2 hours :mostly by todoist Other than that i could have given it 5‚ù§Ô∏è",
"Really like the app, but I've found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view, for some sections the tasks don't appear and the ""add another task"" button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position.",
"ü•∞ Smooth, versatile, effective. Syncs perfectly with Google Calender. Honestly the best to-do app I've tried (after much searching). I'm sooo organized ü§Øüí´ü§ë might go pro... üò≥üò≥üò≥",
"Nice interface, good help, good configurability. Integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though.",
Good for project management by related project and task lists. However when subnotes are needed a seperate notemaking application is necessary. The user interface is not made for making extended notes on projects and tasks.,
I really dislike the projects thing. Just let me make new lists. I want a list for movies to watch another for gift ideas etc. The best way to do that through this app is subitems which are a pain to deal with. Moving over to wunderlist,
Really love this app and so happy that my previous feedback was acknowledged. Only reason not 5 stars is my widget has stopped working. The widget is essential to keeping on top of my tasks! Please fix soon!,
"easy to use and works over many platforms. i like that there is a community of users and tutorials to help you maximize its utility for what you need. i also enjoy the karma feature, which gamifies productivity and helps me stay motivated",
"Pretty easy to use, once I put it into my routine, no problems with multi-device sync, works perfectly between my phone and smartwatch!!",
"This app is brilliant! I prefer quicky typing my TODOs with date & time, rather than picking it using the controls, and it does a beautiful job in processing my text.",
Putting REMINDERS behind a paywall pretty much means you're forced to pay for the app to get much use out of it,
"It works great. Using the free version to get to know it but I'm liking what I see, do, and get done. Update: The app is still going strong. It faces you with all the things that needs to be done. Scary but realistic. Didn't expect to get this much done by simply using an app.",
I feel so much more organized with this app. It helps me plan and prioritize my day and stay on track. I feel like I get more done and don't have things nagging at the back of my mind that I need to do because I've got them scheduled through todoist.,
"Very easy to manage tasks. Just don't know how to set to receive notifications for all tasks into project, not just for tasks assigned to me. Good job.",
"Really? You make a calendar/planning app and the force people to pay per month for it to have any form of reminders, even just local push notifications? Sorry, everything this does in Pro can be done with Google calendar for free.",
"Fast, intuitive, great sync times and seamless integration across platforms. recently discovered the team collaboration options and love them too!",
I found that the several tabs was unnecessary and prevents me to be productive. We have to pay for an app to get reminders. I'll rather use an app with ads if the reminder function is gone,
"A lot of basic functions are limited to a paid premium membership. Better off using a free app that doesn't restrict functions to premium users. Also, a karma level...? What? Like anyone needs some ridiculous feature like that. Sure... you give THAT to free users.",
"it keeps me remind of what I needed to do on the day, and the days that follow. planning helps to execute your days accordingly, without wasting any time one things that weren't part of the plan. that's when you'll notice the distractions. All in all, I like it.",
I've tried to use to-do list type applications before. I see the benefit in them. But they never really stuck with me. The customization and organization options in this app make it great. I use it daily.,
I added a bunch of stuff to the schedule and went to check it the next day and all of the data was gone. I deleted the app. Useless.,
Useless. Installed this and got partner to install. Not possible to share projects. Help section describes clicking on something that isn't there.,
"I decided to try this app out before work on a Sunday. The app immediately said ""enjoy your day off you deserve it"" but it was not my day off and I could not edit it, so I just stopped using it.",
"Overall, it's pretty darn good. The only problem I have with the app right now is that the crown doesn't work for scrolling. Please integrate this simple feature for five stars.",
Really great app is very useful and easy to use. It gives me reminders if I don't finish something and I can set reminders for future things that I need to get done.,
Would be even better if there is an option to make multiple lists on the dashboard itself to make it even more convenient to use.,
I love how simple and yet powerful Todoist is. I recommend anyone at least try it the app and try the premium trail.,
Seems great but setting reminders is a premium feature... I'm not sure how a basic function of a list app can be a premium feature. Not worth it.,
Microsoft To-Do is WAYYYYY more user friendly and has tons more options. Including list sharing. Which I use multiple times per day.,
Best To do list app out there,
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.,
"Almost perfect! If there was the option to only share specific sections instead of entire projects, this app would be perfect.",
"Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks.",
"It's alright, nothing bad, not perfect. Can't give perfect score partially out of principle, but would give it 4.7/5.0 there are some minor complaints but they are minor nitpicks.",
Shared projects no longer sync among users. Their workaround of leaving and rejoining does not fix it. Without being able to sync this app is pointless.,
The right balance of simplicity and power for me and my partner. I love the quick entry method and Google calendar sync.,
Excellent tool for simple project planning. Lacks one feature that would make it 5*. Ability to add notes (usually form ideas before converting to tasks).,
I wish it would give me notifications on what I have to do,
Very very very very very very verrrrrrrryyyyyyyy baaaaadddddd apppppp üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,
Please add a student discount,
Recurring reminders removed?!,
wish I could enter a to-do easily without having a specific date assigned to it automatically! otherwise the app is slick and very useful.,
Excellent and very straightforward and easy to use especially now Boards (kanban-style) are here. As I am very spatially-oriented this is ideal for me.,
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.,
"Nice app, would be better if I can see the tasks that I've completed. I know it's in the paid function but it's too much of an important function that we are missing out on.",
"Having the ability to put my tasks in regular sentences and having todoist understand when and what I'm trying to remember is so well done I haven't used Google assistant for reminders in weeks, I also love the widget the app has built in",
Does not integrate well between all applications. The interface w/ outlook is horrible. Ability to set up task groups for shared tasks lists is lacking.,
Worst most useless app I've had the misfortune to try. Literally zero point in having this over Google calendar. Don't waste your space. It's useless. You can't have recurring tasks& everything is behind a pay wall. Avoid.,
"Great app but setting the times and dates in dutch doesn't always work very well, for example if you type 'half 3' it thinks you mean 3:30 while it's actually 2:30.",
"Very customizable planner, easy to navigate, but not basic. I love it. Thanks to the creators, you guys really did a nice job.",
Makes managing your to do list on the go quick and easy. Excellent feature parity with the web and desktop versions too!,
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part .",
Love that we can share work on a project and assign and schedule tasks and subtasks. Each person sharing the list can see when items are checked off. Very useful.,
Used Todoist for years now and it is essential to manage my busy life. I list even the most mundane tasks. Never lets me forget. So reliable! Wonderful!,
It'd be 100% if it would notify me of my list on the day at a specified time. I believe I seen this option but you have to pay. That does not make it a free app after all. Other than that its a decent app.,
I've tried many different apps and this is the one the has worked for me! So simple but very powerful and love that it works seamlessly between my phone and desktop.,
Can sync with Mac and Android but very Disappointed with this app. alarm/ reminder does not function. This should be included. Have to pay for it to function.,
"Best app for keeping track of clients, jobs and bills. Looked a long time for something like this. It's great for tasks too",
"First google result described todoist as a great free reminder app. They failed to mention you have to pay a yearly fee to receive any reminder notifications. Which IMHO, is absurd",
It's really useful to be able to write down tasks and reminders in my phone. Todoist is good for keeping it organized.,
love this app! I have used so many task apps in the past and none compare to this one. its easy to add things to yet keeps everything so organized and easy to find.,
"I love this app a lot. You can organize your short term and long term goals, and set their dates, whether they're a one time thing or something you do weekly or yearly.",
"Fantastic free features, good multi platform support. For a free app for me to get started with planning, I really can't complain.",
"Very useful, the paid version is worth every penny if you like to keep your lists organized and across multiple devices.",
"This app is great for managing tasks in a hectic schedule. It also keeps a log of the time and date each time was completed, this is great to check how you are managing your time! Definitely check it out!",
"Was initially sad that Wunderlist got shut down, but so happy to have discovered Todoist instead. I like it even better -- it is smart but also simple and not overwhelming. Wonderfully designed.",
opened up the review box while i was trying to check off some stuff. go away,
"work for a while then stopped syncing fixed it then it stopped working. same thing happens a third time. researched the problem. turns out ALOT of people had rhe same problem. they switched to any.do, so did i.",
A blip after recent update but now loving it again.,
A great app but the subscription based fee for all functionality is not good value and prevents many from committing. A one off cost would be much better.,
I have used to do list managers both paper and software for almost 40 years. I have researched ad nauseam. This is simply the best I've ever used.,
Really helps me to keep on top of my uni work! The ability to add projects and colour code really helps and using it on all my devices means i can always stay on track.,
"Linked across all my devices, and categorized into projects and tasks and can categorize priorities by colour and with reminders linked to my calendar. Great for productivity. Top app",
Super intuitive and simple to use. Good widgets. Actually increases productivity rather than frustration because it works.,
It's one of the first times when a free options has almost everything I need. It has a clear and pleasantly looking design.,
"Exactly what I needed...easy to use, non invasive reminders, simple to make changes as needed. I am an older person and the help this gives me is great!",
I love Todoist! It is an essential tool that keeps me organized while on the go. Simple and intuitive. I've recommended it to family and friends.,
Really enjoying this so far. Easy to use and helps me keep track of what I need to do. I work for myself and have lots of things on my plate so getting things out of my head and onto the app helps with that horrible feeling of overwhelm.,
"This app helps me manage the many things I have to accomplish in a day. The interface is simple and clean. It's easy to use, not too many bells and whistles, but enough features for day to day use.",
"Good app, just wish you were able to back date a completed task so I can use it for tracking habits as well, but it's a to do list app and works well.",
"Love this app. Makes life so much easier to keep organised, especially being able to sync across several platforms.",
"great for dumping all the tasks on my mind into one place, then i can easily drag them in order of the easiest ones first, and then blast through the tasks one by one.",
"Awesome organization tool, simply the best!! I had always struggle with sorting and rescheduling tasks, which in this app is done with ease A+ I truly recommend you give it a try",
My task manager of choice both personally and professionally. It's feature packed and provides timely reminders to ensure I'm staying on task.,
Just started using it....the interface is easy to learn and the amount of detail is just robust enough to be appropriate for what I do.,
Please add an option to delete all completed tasks together. Although we can hide deleted tasks but its better to permanently deleting completed tasks after some time and then using the hide feature as a recycle bin. Other than this It is a great app.,
"This has become a part of my daily routine. Can be used across devices like phone, laptops, desktops with auto sync. Also can arrange tasks in personalised groups.",
No reminder options for free version of this app. How can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for. My alarm clock would be better than this app. Sorry I don't recommend.,
Paid experience is better than free. But it will do since there are no ads. UI and design can be made note clutter free.,
Widget constantly breaking. Not updating and showing a loading icon at bottom. Defeats the entire point of having a widget easily viewable.,
"so easy to make custom recurring tasks, assign categories to them, add alerts, add notes, assign priority levels, etc. the premium version is totally worth it!",
I love this app and I haven't fully explored all of its abilities. It has kept me on point with a few things.... and I love the reminder function.,
A great tool for someone who want to boost up his productivity! Everything that I need from a todo list application is already implemented. I would definately recommend trying it out!,
"Very helpful and easy to use while being user friendly but not overly simple. Perfect for lists, projects, calendar reminder and simple side notes.",
"It's nice to set mini goals, complete the various tasks and check off those boxes. It's easy to use and convenient.",
I'm using the free version and it's fantastic. A great way to hold myself accountable and organize my tasks. I might even pay for the premium version!,
"In the parlance of our time, this is the G.O.A.T. to do list app. Especially for Android. Especially if yoy use Outlook for work. 12/10 would to doist again.",
"Reinstalled, still have incorrect list updates compared to my gf, which then results in incorrect groceries every freaking time. This after months. Time to find an alternative app now.",
Loved it! The best part is to be able to sync on phone and pc. Pretty easy to use and amazing UI.,
"Absolutely incredible. Thank you so much for creating this app. Its helped me progress foward each day with my work, my podcast, my 5k jogging goal and most importantly raising my son. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work",
"The best to do app, the repeat task after a certain time period is my favourite and a unique feature that lacked in all todo apps i have tried. Kudos to team Todoist",
I really like this app. It usually works flawlessly. But yesterday sincyng with Google calendar simply stopped working for no apparent reason. That was one of my favorite features and now it's gone.,
One of the simplest to do app which could be practically put in use out of so many organizer apps gone through myself. Would have given 5 stars but simply an alarm demands a lot of money from you.,
It does a beautiful job at helping you use their app through their website and other tutorials. It makes you soooo much more likely to stick to using it than other apps.,
"Simple, easy to use. The goal setting option is really helpful. It encourages you to stick to your plan and to do your tasks.",
"Hands down ths best task app. i used many and stuck with Todoist. The app is not without draw backs, frustrating sub task management and start date work arounds.",
Wanna love this all BUT it's half ruined bc they force all Overdue tasks to the forefront at all times. Overwhelming! I keep acting avoidant towards the app bc of that which defeats the purpose. Cant turn it off,
love it! I have way too many to-dog's on my list and it's easy to reschedule them at the end of a due date. also like being able to break down by project and priority.Yes,
"This app is really helpful. Earlier,I thought that to do list apps were useless and were a total waste of time. But this app is a real time saver. The reason is that earlier I had to think what I have to do and need to do in my mind, but now I can write in my to do list and get stress free",
Widget working again (not refheshing constantly),
"Hi,  I am using Vivo V5 Plus handset. I had downloaded ""Todoist"" for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work, if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen.  Kindly help me in this regard.",
Tried and loved Any.Do until they billed we without giving me notice or me even signing up for a paid plan. I'm glad it happened though because it allowed me to discover Todoist which is a much better and more complete app.,
Generally good app.I've been using it for a year now. It would be great if they could have a calender view of activities and a promodo timer.,
"Absolutely brilliant for keeping tabs on your tasks and timelines! Great Project Management tool, plus it motivates you daily as well.",
"Please ad an option to turn off check boxes on the widget. Since it was added, I'm constantly checking off items by mistske. Once you do this, it is tedious to get the item back.",
It's very easy to accidentally complete tasks and the only way to undo an accidental completion is behind a pay wall. Instant one star,
The app became unusable recently. When moving and changing the tasks the ui won't update. This service workout a reliable app is useless.,
"This is the first result when you search for ""reminder"" apps. ""Reminder"" is in the name. However, to give yourself an alert is a premium feature. Hard pass.",
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated",
"Excellent, very useful with a smooth powerful and intuitive interface. It's a must to keep my daily tasks on track",
"So far I can't complain. It's been reliable, helped me keep focus on my daily goals and the feeling of accomplishment from closing all tasks is truly something. Keep up the good work.",
this is a great app to keep me organized. I can access it on my phone or tablet. recent updates have improved the flexibility to reschedule tasks.,
Great! Was super easy to import my lists from Wunderlist and a bonus to have 2 months of premium. Seems rich in features and I like the design.,
"Replacing Franklin planner, so far so good. Still need my Google calendar to look more than 7 days out. May have to upgrade to access reminders.",
Love it. I'm actually getting things done! It takes a little bit of learning to work out how to make recurring tasks etc but once you do it's all there. (Free version),
"everytime the app gets update, i receive ALL PREVIOUS NOTIFICATIONS.  // Edit: I am sorry, but, I do not have time for that. I am using lenovo P2, it happens every single update. I have just had it again and app is no longer on my phone.",
"Pretty straight forward apps, it just make a list of the thing you have to take care. Simple, not too fancy, or complicated.",
"This app is amazing! It looks so simple, but at the same time it has so many features that makes things easier to plan. Definitely love it! If you're trying to organize your life, this app is the answer üòé",
Great free experience! I can organize my to-do lists into projects with subtasks. It's almost like a sprint board for my life.,
"Best task manager I've used, only thing I'd like to see is moving the sorting on the widget to a drop down in the top bar, rather then it taking up space where the tasks show up.",
Simple. Clear. Unobstrusive. But alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view.,
"Never uninstalled an app so fast. There is zero point to this app without reminders which you cannot do without a pro subscription. You need to pay 4 dollars a month to get a notification, what a joke.",
Very easy to use. Includes helpful widgets which let you easily add new tasks and see which ones you still need to finish.,
"Great gtd implementation. the are a few keyboard shortcuts that don't work as expected on the web version. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars!",
great and easy to use for both day to day tasks and long term things. This app has got me back on track and more productive. also a great feeling of accomlishment with all you get done.,
This app works very well. Adding new tasks are easy and it syncs seemlessly between devices. Can highly recommended it.,
"I've actually used this app for a long time off and on. it has some great features, some of which are premium. But even the free app is one of the best todo list apps around.",
Absolutely amazing app and seriously have nothing bad to say. I wish that we can get more perks as we use the app and its features more to encourage us to mange our time wisely,
"Reminders and notifications should always be there with the free version, can't think about a to-do app without those basic features.",
"The some part of the app is glitched and the completion sound plays randomly throughout the day. Edit, reinstalling fixed it.",
"I really appreciate the ability to schedule recurring tasks, reschedule easily, prioritize tasks, and easily identify the due date with abbreviations like ""every sat"".",
It is strange that I'm no longer able to share text/link from other apps to create a new task. Please investigate. Edited 27Aug: This has been fixed. Thank you!,
"It's a useful app but I wish their was a way to actually see the calender, or to like see the dates you have stuff on with out having to like check them off. Other then that it comes in handy.",
"This is the better app to organized my personal issues and professional work. Simple, easy to use and amazing features to keep me organized.",
"My Favorite Productivity Tool! I don't know how I would capture and accomplish all the tasks life throws at me without Todoist. Coming up on 2 yrs of premium subscription, worth every penny to me!",
"Works great and the price is right! I started using it with IFTTT and Evernote, and have almost dropped Evernote. This does what I need without the extra stuff.",
"It has everything that it claims but I do not think that this app is for my own needs. I uninstalled the app a while ago but now, now I have frequent emails from the developers and has become rather irritating. Is there anyway you can stop these emails?",
"this is a really great app for organizing thoughts, projects, and other needed things. easy to use and really visually appealing.",
Super handy. I use it all the time. The free version is great but i can imagine you might want to pay for bonuses like reminders,
"A decent app that helps a lot. I can see and check off what I need to do, and what I have completed. It helps me plan projects in advance with more detailed lists.",
"Only about every day reminder i rate 5 stars. Other apps can't cause Android powersave system. This app has a trick or something, and it keeps me remind. Thank you!",
"Starting grad school on top of working a part time job, balancing writing a novel and hosting a bimonthly podcast, rock climbing, and trying to maintain a social life, and also just household chores. Can't imagine what i would do with out this app.",
"Great app. Decent interface. However, some features are available only for premium user. Though overall its great :)",
I've been looking for something I can use for recurring daily tasks and the ease of use in Todoist is great. It's helped a ton with my daily organizational needs.,
"Just discovered the section header function so the app finally makes sense to me! would be good to have a daily summary in the morning and then a ""catch up"" notification in the afternoon to remind you to tick off tasks",
I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom. SOLVED,
I am not an organized person. I bought this to help remedy the situation. Has it solved all my problems? I don't think an app can do that. But it definitely makes me *feel* organized and on top of things so I'll give it 5 stars for that!,
it's a good app that helps you to organize and priorities and schedule your tasks plus some other cool features but you have to have the premium version.,
Probably can do a lot more than I'm using it for but finding it very useful to compose my daily to do list for work. Easy to change order of tasks which I like.,
"Overall a good experience. I think the price is too much for what they are offering, but it is by no means a bad product. Since it was too much I asked for a refund and they did it with no hesitation. My regards to the Todoist team",
"Can't add new tasks on mobile app anymore. Not sure if the app had a bad update or what, but now when I hit the +Add New Task button on the android app it just looks like I'm clicking it but the new task window doesn't show up and no keyboard shows up. I can only add tasks through desktop version on my computer. Please fix. I already tried uninstall and reinstall",
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.,
This is my new favorite to do list app! It's got everything I need and want. my favorite part is that I can prioritize and schedule tasks and it integrates into my calendar.,
"The easiest, most intuitive way to get organized ever. I was obsessed on day 1 and had my team onboard by day 2. Total lifesaver.",
"Just works. The UI is sometimes a bit crowded, but nothing serious. I use it for planning and scheduling daily routine.",
Would be 5 stars for sure except I can't add a task to the top of the list. It is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift. And they do know about the idea per the forums. Love everything else.,
Great app for staying organized and creating to-do lists. Must have for those that like to keep track of project tasks or just everyday life tasks.,
"I love it, the widget is great for the basics of writing new tasks and marking completed ones. The best to do list app I've tried. 10/10 would recommend",
"I can't see anything in my projects list at all after the update, and my app has become laggy. Edit: Updated the app and the issue has been fixed. Thanks for the prompt response Todoist team!",
"Great app!! This is what I have been looking for. A more organized and featured setup with a traditional ""outline"" type of foundation. Great work IMO....",
"I tried other todo apps, but this is the best one. It is much easier to use and all my todos synced between my devices. And I can invite my fellows to join my todo list.",
App works great and is a powerful add on to the website. Data always stays synced between two unlike some other apps ive tried.,
Great productivity tool. Simple to set up and use with good options for organising. The Premium option is very good value,
"Perfect app, but sometimes there is a bug when reordering tasks. Tasks ""reorder"", but then, they get back in the same order.",
The best task list. Tried other task apps and this is the most intuitive and reliable. Well worth upgrading to the paid version.,
"yes, another todo list. what is so good? there are templates for projects and tasks, and there is a theoretical base on the concept of productivity.",
"It'll be very useful if we could see the tasks we've completed, rather than it disappearing tbh, other than that, the app is grat. Kudos!",
"Simple, elegant and extremely useful. I especially liked the priorities you can assign (I was looking for an app where I could classify tasks by urgency and importance and this works)",
Really good experience so far. Only improvement I could see would be if there was a very quick way to add a task from the lock screen.,
The widget doesn't work seemlessly. I would have to open todoist once daily and wait for a few seconds to sync the same in my widget,
"The old interface was better (where the menu button was on the top left corner, and would appear with a right swipe) the new interface sucks!!",
"It was a nice app But something really got on my nerve , constantly there was a sound of a notification that really was irritating me , even i turned of notification of this app and every single sound of it , it didn't stopped and i had to uninstall it.",
"Great for productivity if you are easily distracted! As I've downloaded the app and started using it with Chrome's Pomodoro extension, my productivity has risen enormously. I really can't believe it!",
Very user friendly. Easy to add and revise items. LOVE the reminders and notifications. That is critical for me.,
"Great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes. Premium isnt necessary, only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once",
Best feature is that you can clear the notification and if they are overdue take it will come back the next day. will never understand apps that don't keep reminding you of undone tasks.,
"This app is the best I've tried.I have been using premium for 1 mo. and have purchased a year subscription.I'm glad I took the time to work out how to best use todoist for my specific work needs.It's taking some getting used to.My only complaint right now is with recurring tasks.Eg,if you have several tasks you need to accomplish every Monday,as you check them off,the next occurrence shows up on the list immediately.I'd prefer to clear my list and have the same tasks pop up the following Monday",
"After using Todoist for 3 months, I have considered it one of the most effective applications so far. I have planned pretty everything using this app and could not deny to say that it has made my life a lot easier!",
Useless for me because reordering doesn't work reliably. It messes up the tasks after dropping an item to a new location within the project.,
"I love todoist, I use the app and website and it's a life saver. I use it for my todo lists for my own business and even just the free plan offers so much. P.S 4 stars so I don't look like a robot, would rate 5 but god knows how many 5 star reviews are robots angnore.",
"Really Love the app, it helps me set my day and priorities straight... If you want an Evernote alternative, I would recommend this app. Edit: Even Better after adding the new features, you deserve a praise Dev's. I generally never hunt an app down on playstore to give an excellent review, but you made me worth it.",
Great App. I am able do all my daily stuff in one place. you need to pay to open some features like reminder but the free version has all I need for now. overall I'd highly recommend,
My current go-to app for to-do's. Intuative design and easy to use UI makes it simple to track my work and personal tasks.,
"Fantastic application. I love how you set deadlines, priorities and project by simply writing it in the task. Edit: the new board is really a great feature for project management",
"This is the to do app with the best features (or just the features I personally need). However, my recurring tasks keep disappearing, which is simply unacceptable behaviour for a to do app.",
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled.",
"Very functional way to keep important information in a easy to navigate app. Perfect digital tool to apply the concepts of ""Getting Things Done.""",
"Take the time to read about all the features and dive in... awesome tool that I would recommend highly. Way more than just a ""To Do"" list.",
"Only began using it but seems intuitive to use. Love that I have various lists, link to projects, share lists, assign tasks and gave due dates",
"After completing a task it should not disappear, like other apps it should move to the bottom of the list. Please create such a feature! Rest of the app is awesome!!",
"Very good, has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff. Haven't tried the collaboration part yet!",
"Please Add the following features: ‚Ä¢ Allow to group by ""project sections"" in filters ‚Ä¢ Allow board view for filters ‚Ä¢ List view to be decluttered and have columns for the different fields (similar to Asana) ‚Ä¢ Today and upcoming view to not only show tasks assigned to you, but ALL tasks ‚Ä¢ Change Add Task widget icon ‚Ä¢ Ability to change the color of the entire task box, based on priority (currently only the bullet changes color) ‚Ä¢Priority: ability to change colors, and to add more priority options",
Wonderful app! Keeps me focused and on task. It was hard to forget anything because it sent alerts and reminders via email. Definetely recommended.,
"Great app that keeps me able to manage my schedule. You'll find that once you start to develop time management skills, there is a lot of time leftover to use.",
"Getting things done. Though, i find that without a due date, some items easily fall through the cracks. Due dates are key.",
Just got a subscription and so far I'm loving it. The only thing I'd like to change so far is for it to be quicker adding a task from the smart watch app.,
"great app to organize both work and personal tasks. either for one time tasks or routines, todoist is the best system to keep track and remind me of my tasks and goals",
"Have tried any.do, wunderlist, Google keep, tasks, Evernote. This works the best for me especially since it allows syncing with calender.",
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.,
"Keeps spamming your email (even after you uninstall the app) with marketing emails. No, I don't want your app, I did not like it, I did not subscribe to you email subscriptions, get lost",
Great app! Too bad a lot of helpful features are for premium only. I'd like to have a calendar layout of the week.,
"Amazingly useful piece if software, enabled me to better organise i do from everyday tasks, food shopping and my personal life goals and projects. I recommend it to friends regularly.",
"I'm awful at keeping on track when i have a big project - whether involving school or a home project, I forget little tasks all the time. ToDoist is great at keeping track of the tasks and you can set up how much nagging you need.",
"Works as I want it to: easy to assign due dates and clear interface. Unfortunately my company has blocked web acces so I switched to MS To Do, which is quite worse without the board option",
Todoist enables me to plan my to-do list with schedules and time which is wonderful for time boxing of tasks... The new boards are wonderful love it greatly as it helps to see the progress of projects,
"Nice app, asy to use, wasn't keen on the email alerts, though I guess they were only doing their job and reminding me what I hadn't done! Easy to turn them off though and enjoying the app even more.",
very good but not as good as Wunderlist. it lacks the simplicity of the interaction. sub tasks for example are not as good implemented.,
"New widget only tells you have something on a particular day, but not what. Tbh, it's become pointless, taking up a large chunk of screen but not providing info at a glance. Now looking for an app that does what it says on the tin.",
Absolutely great to track your to-do-list. I strongly suggest everyone who wants to track their new year resolution to use this.,
"Awesome app! It's like having a spare brain, to remember all the stuff that I won't. Great interface, super intuitive. I like it!",
"It works great. It's simply with extra stuff that I may never use, but Im not in for the details. I needed an easy 'to do list' and Todolost does just that.",
Easy to Navigate with simple task input and completion of task. Sense of accomplishment. I like it so far.,
easy to use and navigate. also lots of options even without paying for the upgrade would definitely reccomend to others,
"Excellent App. Task input, auto recognition of time & dates, Rscheduling is easy. Tried at least 10 other apps but Todoist is best amongst all.",
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article üò°üò°üò°? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.,
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.,
amazing app! Im much better with keeping on track with my activities with it :) i would really like to request the feature of having a do-date and deadline though so i can plan when to do big tasks better,
"I have a running grocery list, reminders of personal and business tasks I want to do, all at my fingertips. I'm finding new uses for it daily.",
Needs an option to start/end the day at a different time then midnight. Also better options for repeating and expiring tasks.,
Generally it's pretty good. I wish the tasks that don't get done get flagged to come up as either notifications or emails so that you can act on them. Maybe they can automatically go to the next day as well,
A very powerful app and totally reliable. I especially like the Karma system (partly because of animeüòú) as it is very sophisticated and clean. All-in-all a pretty reliable method.,
"On free version can't even set a specify time for a task (can only set a date), nor set a reminder. What's the point of a to do list app without these functions? Uninstalled.",
I tried many apps to track my daily to do before settling on to-doist. This is a simple yet powerful app to track your work and progress. I love it and absolutely recommend it.,
"Enjoying writing daily tasks. The app is so easy to use, but haven‚Äôt used it to its full potential yet. Syncing across to my laptop, makes life easier too.",
No feedback. And I want to arrange the tasks according to their priorities in the home screen widget. And I want to repeat some tasks weekly.,
It helps me manage my time with such ease. I plan everything in the morning and then complete all the tasks till nighttime. This product is amazing!! Thank you!!,
I was struggling with keep a set schedule on things and remembering to do the things that I need to do. Thanks to this apps widget that I can put on my screen it helped a lot.,
Great tool for kepping me on track. The integrations was very important. I use multiple tools and when they all talk it makes things easy.,
I like that everything I need to do is right in one app with a reminder! Loving it! It also allows lists withing the list you are making.,
"This app literally helped me be a better person by being able to organize my life and get things done more efficiently. The Pro version is definitely worth the buy, too. Thanks, Todoist!",
"I like the app so far. One issue is like someone else said, why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14-day trial? Second, why don't the notifications pop up where I can see them? That was one of the main reasons that I got the app. I need to be constantly reminded of what I need to do. I have ADHD and remembering a bunch of things that I have to do is a HUGE issue.",
"5* scheduling app! Simple and intuitive. Convenient ""inbox"" to list tasks and categorise later. I am enjoying being more proud tive by using this app.",
It's UI is clean and easy to understand. It's feature of auto picking dates by writing the date directly is very good and innovative.,
"It's a todo list, no better than any other, at a great cost, which you can pay for one year up front. I'll use Keep, which does much more, for free.",
"This has been my favorite to do app for years, but suddenly the badge app has stopped working on my Note 10. If I don't quickly find a way to resolve this, I'll be looking for another list solution. üôÅ",
"Simple and easy to use. You can schedule events by typing something like ""every other thursday"" after the title and Todoist will automatically schedule it for you.",
"Putting things on the list as soon they pop in my head means I'm remembering to do so much more & having the daily target makes me do the tasks & more. Funny how ticking a box ""done"" can be so motivating. Todoist is fab",
"Perfectly simple, yet very customizable. This app sets out and does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is clear that the developers have had a genuine interest in making other people's lives better and more productive. Highly recommended.",
"Use it everyday, zero complaints and they're actually ahead of the curve as far as providing new features and functionality.",
"Perfect. Simple but effective - I like the calendar integration, calendar view, projects and subtasks.",
"This is a To Do app, yet something as simple as setting a reminder for a task is a PREMIUM feature you have to pay for. How pathetic. There are other BETTER apps available for free. Bye Bye.",
"Sends mails claiming monthly payments of $4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs $7 And also the app is quite crappy without premium, and premium at $4 would still be too expensive for what you get.",
"Don't do it. You have to sign up with your email, then you get emails Multiple times every day pushing you to sign up for the Pay version. Why would I want the ""Pro"" version when the app sucks?",
"Great app! I use it when I realize I am multitasking too much. Also, I created a list for packing and grocery list that I share with the household which is suoer helpful so we dont forget anything.",
Favorite to-do app. Easy to add and manage schedule. Get rewarded for doing so and keeping your productivity streak.,
"Syncs perfectly, very easy to use across all platforms so your tasks are alway at your fingertips be it phone, tablet, computer. Great product, reasonable price!!",
I am now becoming more on top of things with this app. The feature that aggregates your score is a huge boost in morale to make sure you are doing what you intend to do. This is such a great tool and I have recommended this to a few people I know. Thank you Todoist team for this :),
This app is truly awesome. very powerful integrations with all manner of platforms. really nice to have something like this. has reallly helped me to be more organized.,
"flexible tool to capture, organize, filter and manage changing priorities. Goes with me on mobile app and accessible on PC by web browser.",
"(Update:Any timeline to add this?)Hi Can you add secondary filter, like currently you provide filter option priority 1, priority 2 etc. When we r using a filtered view like ""View all"" then all task priority 1 (from different projects) gets lined up sequentially. Here if suppose 15 task have Priority 1, 30 have priority 2 then it is difficult to sort. Can you please add secondary priority filter like SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 etc which we can assign to task and then u know we can see proper sorted view.",
"This app sends an email out to remind you that you have overdue items on your list. if you have many tasks and can't keep track of what to do, you should try this app.",
"wish they had long-term thing, or weekly checklist that wasnt split up by days. besides that, it's great!",
"Best ""to do list"" apo I've ever seen. I tried many, and this one is the most powerful and easy to use. Important thing is that app is improving from day to day. Everything you may be dislike today, tomorrow can be fixed.",
"I wish the app would automatically disappear from the phone's background after assigning tasks. And, a repeat period from-to.",
"Awesome app, helps me keep track of everything I need to do. Best feature is the connection to Google Calendar which makes this just perfect!",
For someone with adult ADHD this app is life saving. Within two weeks my life is back to fully organized. The integration with Gmail and Google Calendar is excellent. I couldn't live without it.,
"So far Todoist (the free version) has been helpful. It has helped me organize, and figure out how to approach, different tasks.",
the one I've stuck with and paid for compared to all the rest. best balance of functionality and simplicity/usability.,
Love the app! Would be even better if you could set daily tasks that occur every day and have a sort of calendar. Thanks,
"I love this app! Helps me keep track of those things that I need to do, priority, and the time they need to be done. A great aid in my productivity along with a good note-taking app. Enjoy!",
Great app that keeps me on track for immediate and longterm goals. Plus it syncs with Google Calendar.,
easy to use! I wanted a to do app and this one fits the bill. not much of a learning curve and can adapt to how i want to use it.,
"love the app, love that it connects seamlessly to the computer version, so pleased that it connects well to other users even in the free version so my partner and i can share project lists.",
Cross platform and easy to use. Would like to be able to list all the tasks across the different projects though.,
I love the functionality and idea. I uninstalled because setting a reminder for a task should NOT be a premium feature.üòí My Google calendar does that as a standard so why have this?,
"Easy to use. I love the email reminders and the ability to add photos, emails, and comments to tasks!",
"I love this app. it let's you separate by category and cross things off as a whole task or even sub tasks. I have lists for every project, for my FT job, passion projects, and small business 100% recommend.",
"Not having push notifications (reminders for tasks) in the free version makes the app entirely worthless, and premium is far too expensive.",
Download it and then immediately uninstalled. Have to pay premium prices to get any features at all. Can't even set up reminders. Don't bother with this app.,
Been using this app for almost 4 years. Truly one of the best. Edit: I just need you to know how badly I've been waiting for Upcoming View! I can finally quit using other calendar apps for good!!!,
"This is a simple app and should not have any premium features and yet, one of the most important things about an online to-do list: a reminder notification, costs money.",
"Has been helpful for events, reminders, chores, and lists. I love that my husband and I can share projects. Easy to use!",
This app is really helpfull. I'm a third year student who have a full room of task. This app so remind me to do my schedule or paper deadline. Thx so much for this app. i love it.,
"Hugely helpful for tracking important tasks. Use in conjunction with something like Google Calendar to help spread work evenly across the coming weeks-- the ""find a day to do this task"" workflow is the only thing I find a bit lacking.",
"Made a list of things to do. Came back and the list was gone, but apparently I'd completed 7/5 tasks and had nothing left to do. Complete waste of time!",
"Nice app for tracking daily tasks. This is the free feature of app. Further, there are premium features in the app at additional cost, which I have not tried.",
"Like others have said. Before it was the best todo list app, but now it's painful to do even simple things. Specifically the additional pop-up window on mobile app is just horrible.",
"Easy and effective task management. I especially like the home screen widget which allows me to view tasks by project, due date, and next 7 days.",
"This is beyond helpful when planning out my day. I use this for both school and personal projects. It's aesthetic, organized, and simple to use. I'm in love with Todoist! üíõ",
It's as if this app was designed specifically for me. Really helped me organise and de-clutter my schedule. Thankd for such a wonderful app. keep up the nice work,
"App is great and all. Only one problem though, the shortcut on my homescreen always went missing after i put it. I am using a custom launcer and idk what happened, please fix this, thank you ^^",
It's very versatile; the project system makes it easy to group tasks together. The one problem is that it doesn't have a calendar view.,
Everything is fine.Few things are needed to be added at must to make this app awesome for five stars. 1. Milestone for each Project. 2. Weekly Calenders 3. Dashboard Please add these featuresm I would love to buy a premium if i would get these. Thanks.,
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money,
I have ADHD and this app has been amazing. It has helped me stay focused on my projects and the seamless use between mobile and desktop is amazing.,
It's really helps me to track things that I need to do in my everyday life and it's really helpful to me I didn't know about this until I was going through play store and I saw this and I thought to myself that instead of just writing it down on the paper you have a whole app that you can use to just truck things that are important to you like conferences things that you want to do something that you want to do special for somebody's birthday or something like that.....,
"Instead of tasks simply disappearing from the list when done, please add the option to do a strikethrough. It'll feel way more satisfying.",
I love it. I tried so many to do apps in playstore and this is one of the top 3 for me! Please add calendar view and this will be perfect.,
"This is so beautiful app, im starting I used to use, but I liked apple's reminder app. But after as this app updated and I started using again and explored features, so cool. So useful. This app helped a lot. I totally recommend it and explore features and widgets.",
One week in. Has definitely kept me on task. I recommend easing into it and break down your goals in managble bite sized tasks. Sub task option is a great tool for that.,
"Simple yet powerful, no ads even in basic version, seamlessly connects to multiple accounts & devices, I use it everyday for reminders & task.",
"Very helpful! It's actually helped me to be in track with my work. But the only drawback would be that the other features that you want to use, you'll have to pay for those. But even without that, it's a good app.",
"Easily the best of the best.. already years using these kind of tools yo manage my business, family, tasks all of it!! And this is by far the best of the best and absolutely fabulous.. just remarkable!! Very helpful.. thank you soo much for my making our lives easier.",
VERY HANDY. Using the free version for personal and business task management. Very handy. Everything I need except access to task history.,
Want a better navigation across projects (hamburger menu is too crumsy). But overall I like this app and the service overall.,
Easy to use and reliable. Apps for just about every platform. I appreciate that they publish a real changelog with updates.,
its really helped me to feel less overwhelmed trying to remember everything i have to do. The goals and karma also appeal to my competitive side.,
"Good, it would be great if I could link it to other apps. Perhaps put the lists on a calendar like in outlook",
Good Reminder. has made life easy.. less to remember ..easy to take out in groceries shop..and buy as per the list ..have shared with wife..she adds items to it..while coming from office ...make purchase..from the list..just add some colour to the base ..,
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36‚Ç¨ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan,
Recurring task doesnt show in the following week until you tick off the task from this week. whyyyy? deleted as i can't use this to plan. UI looks great otherwise.,
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.,
Downloaded the app and added a bunch of items and a couple of categories. Opened it back up a few hours later and everything is gone.,
"This is a literal Godsend. It has helped me finally feel in control of my time and actions. It's helping with my mental health, a lot. I'm using it with David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"", and it is helping me make an awesome change in my life.",
"For the widget, please add the option for larger font size. I like to set the compact mode to prevent accidental ticks, but then each Todo becomes very small. Larger font will help with this case.",
"Best app for GTD workflow. But I use it for a lot more than that. It can be used as a list management system for notes, todos, etc.",
Todoist helps me get things accomplished. It helps me plan my work and home life. Its a tool that can be effective in the hands of beginners if you simply read their helpful tips and tricks.,
"Great app for organizing my tasks. my favorite feature was ""inboxing"" tasks that I wanted to do at some point but not schedule it yet.",
"I truly enjoy this app! While I am still getting used to it, I love that it provides a place for me to get my thoughts and to-do items out of my head and onto paper. Highly recommended for folks who struggle with organization.",
Straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop. Sometimes I get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects.,
It's good but not perfect because I have same tasks everyday and the tasks I kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason I am switching to ticktick,
Changed the program so you can't list all tasks unless you upgrade to premium. Looking for a new do list app.,
"I've been using Todoist for several years. It isn't magic. It takes work to keep up with it. However, as a TODO manager, it works very well and has lots of very nice features",
"If you use Gmail, calendar go with Google tasks free with much more functions and integrated with your calendar events, reminder, tasks without subscription. Stick with the big guys! Waste of time with this app.",
I love todoist. It's definitely asking my top 5 apps. I love that there is a Google Chrome extension. It helps keep me in track and beats hand written post-it note reminders!,
I really like how easy it is to schedule and reschedule tasks and it has been very helpful in making sure I have all my work in place for online learning.,
Todoist is amazing! It has really helped me be more organized and productive. Their point system is also fun.,
"this app is extremely easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. as someone who is very forgetful and disorganised, this app really helped me get my life back in order. definitely reccomend",
Best App I've tried (for this purpose) and I stopped trying others until further notice. I'm considering paying for the fancy things since the app is so smooth and it's cheap enough.,
One of the best To-Do (L)ist apps I've ever come across. Superb UI. Customer care was super quick when I faced a problem. Really appreciate the developers for this app!,
"Todoist keeps me on track, and I have a lot going on. The thing I like best is how it works across platforms, and they made sure the Android version works well.",
This app is so amazingly done and so helpful. I can't begin to describe how much value this app has to me. This app make a huge difference in my life by allowing me to build habits and be consistent with them!!,
"I accidently deleted an item then screen rotated and Undo option did not appear! Developers, please preserve state of the app between rotations!",
"I use it as a shared grocery list tool. I was looking for one that didn't require access to my contacts and which you could simply add ""pb"" rather than ""Kroger creamy peanut butter 14 oz.""",
not quite as good as Wunderlist for me... but overall decent and as I need to use this for work now (as wunderlist blocked!) I am trying to get into it broadly. premium features seem quite pricey.,
"Very Good app, if you're interested in a easy and very functional solution to plan out days ( like I do, or just for any type of task list. This is my #1 go to",
"The daily calm has helped me ""finally"" to consistently Meditate and now that I've established the habit I'm exploring the many other choices Calm offers to advance my mindfulness practice. I'm sleeping better and more relaxed. Well done!",
"Uncomfortable manual typing for time setting in a reminder. Time reminders are not stable, some times push notifications doesn't work.",
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} ü§î. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.,
"Love this app its my number recommend todoist app they have some useful template you can itch and the UI is to elegant so you can feel more comfortable on it, I still look for one option is that promo timer hope they came with this in the future",
"Todoist helpse for work, for my life to organize my regular and irregular tasks I use it to remember things and communicate with my team simple to master yet such an efficient tool cross platforms and dedicated to help people Thanks !",
"Definitely the best app out there for syncing honey-do lists, especially if your life is complicated.",
A really well-designed app with an intuitive interface that has helped me declutter my thoughts and prioritize.,
One of my all time favorite apps! You can easily collaborate with your teammates as well as friends. The Karma option keeps you on the track and forces you to complete your task daily.,
Best app for task management. The integration with Google calendar is a great feature. Smart detection of text is awesome!,
"I love using this app. However, the incessant pop up survey asking ""Do you love Todoist"" and ask you to rate it in Play Store makes the app feel like an insecure partner constantly nagging you for validation. 5 star otherwise.",
"switched from Toodledo, never looked back. comments ate awesome because you can attach files. assigning tasks to projects is also much easier",
This app is great for getting all tasks done. I have had it for a few days now but am finding it great. The one thing I think this app could improve on is when you get your tasks or put your tasks in you should be able to put a time that it will pop up on your screen so you can tell if you should have done it in that time. As I said this is a great app and I recommend it to everyone that needs an app to get everything done you need to get done in a day. Thank you for this app it is great. Xx,
"It's a pretty useful app. I just started using the premium version, I will see how it works. But the free version should be enough for many people tough.",
I am using the premium version. I find that the app works well for basic task keeping as well as repeating tasks.,
"Pretty good free features. Simple to use and easy to see and stay organized, especially with the widget on the home screen you can easily see your list of tasks for the day",
"Good and I like it but notifications are only in paid version, but I like that I can link it to my calendar, but I have to take another step to add notifications to the calendar, and I wish when I marked a task as completed it would remove it from my calendar, but it doesn't. Other than that I like it.",
Very useful app. It really helps you schedule your day and the days ahead very very effectively. Once you figure it out how to apply it to your day you will never leave this app!,
"Really amazing! It helps people achieve your tasks... Better than using a ""piece of paper"". Inclusive you can fix commitments in future days.",
New to it. But seems to be very easy to use. I haven't found something I want it to do yet that is hasn't got. I especially like the gmail integration even though its limited on that side.,
Best task app ever. I always enjoy widgets and this is the only app I found that has one. The reminders are great and the UI is easy to use,
"Good design but when you uncheck items on a list it doesn't put them back into their original order, making it pretty much useless.",
I'm probably not using it to it's fullest potential but it works for what I needed. The main thing I needed was for unfinished tasks to automatically roll over to the next day. Most apps don't do that.,
This app is amazing for students and it allows me to keep track of all my assignments and it helps me make sure that the assignments are never late.,
"Best to do App ever! I am a Supervisor at the company I work for and require my staff to use this app. If you can make a way for a group to access one app and one person to manage the task in that group...fire! I believe in you, make it happen!!!!",
very simple and intuitive interface. love hiw you can set dates and projects by just typing it next to the todo.,
"reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great üôÑ",
"Great productivity app! Tried Wunderlist, Asana, trello- not for me. Todoist is simple and clean + the 2way gcal integration is something I can't live without anymore. Thought about switching to notion but for now todoist is my dawg",
"Great, clutter free, to the point app with enough features (if you think it doesn't exist, Google it! There's many hidden things you need to know!)",
Very good way to stay organized. The subtasks and subprojects are helpful. Reminders and due dates too.,
Works well. No crashes or sync errors so far. Intuitive to use. Dark mode option is much appreciated.,
"Works great and keeps me on track! Wish a few more options were free, but I can work around them well enough.",
works great for me style of task organizing. it is fairly adaptable so you can make it what you want. i highly highly highly recommend this.,
Awesome app. Been using a few years. Love syncing between all my devices. Really helps me to stay organized and more productive.,
"Reliable, easy to use, and well-maintained. I use google tasks and google keep also, but i find that this app helps me manage my to-dos in such a way that makes it indisposable, even as a user of those other services",
"Update: thanks but still doesn't help - could it be phone? On Huawei mate 10. First review: Coming from wunderlist, main use shared shopping and admin lists with family, so have shopping project with sub project for each shop. I made the Shopping project the home screen, but can't see any sub projects and their tasks on Android! Can on Mac. Investigating Sections. So multiple taps hunting for undated tasks. Too complex for family, frustrating for me. OK otherwise.",
Saved myself way too many times when I forgot events and deadlines were about to be due because of a hectic work and school balance. Highly recommended for anybody especially going into medical school,
"I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further.",
"The paid upgrades have everything I want in a to-do app! Primary of which is lots of customization with due dates, reoccurance, and reminders.",
Somewhat complicated to start off with. If you can get past the steep learning curve initially it is the best out there.,
I've tried a couple different apps for making to-do lists and this is easily the winner. Amazing design and usability,
"I love the app BUT the new update has brought this glitch where you can't add tasks to projects by clicking on "" add task"". It doesn't work, instead you have to click on the three dots then click add task",
"Its the best 'to do list' app I've ever come across by first impressions, simple and easy to use, looking forward to using it this week to get rid of my admin!",
The best todo app. Sync with external calendar is very fast and reliable (with 2 way modifications).,
Pretty easy system for making a checklist. Also the fact you can share lists with folks is especially nice.,
Do you want a glorified piece of paper? Here's the perfect app for you. If you thought this app would give notification reminders to do something you have to buy it. A 30 second code cash grab is all this app is.,
"Very handy. The paid feature handling is annoying, those should be disabled (grey) rather than trigger a dialog soliciting purchase ok/cancel. Five otherwise.",
I keep on forgetting to open it and tick off my tasks. They should like send more notifications but not spamming. Otherwise this is an amazing app!,
this app is so amazing... the UX is so simple and u have alot of options to adjust to your task.. syncing with web app and desktop apps. that's my daily task planning app ‚ô•Ô∏è,
The app does everything I need it to do. And I've been looking for an app like this for about 2 years. Big fan of the optiin to make tasks recurring!,
"Having used many ways to be productive in my time, todoist has been my go to todo list for over 4 years now, which I use along side google docs for wordy notes. Well worth the annual cost to get lables, notes etc",
"Todoist has a lot of nice features but it does not include a Start Date, only a Due Date, which makes it difficult for me to use.",
"Using the free version, very pleased so far. Voice ability very useful and mostly accurate.",
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick.",
"In the pricing it states the free version has use of up to 80 projects, but the software cut Me off at 5 projects, rendering it useless to Me. Response ti Devloper response, I sent an e-mail to the contact address right after you responded, and still have not gotten a response to My e-mail .... sad",
"The wear os app does not synchronize correctly with the phone, nor do the widgets synchronize correctly. Once this is fixed it is back to 5 stars.",
Its really good. But is there a way to create a task which repeats itself after certain period of time say every monday just like Google calendar,
It wouldn't let me authinticate a sign in. I tried with using Google to sign in & the screen darkens but does nothing. I tried using email & it kept spinning. I tried with Facebook & it said I logged in but then did nothing. Installed because what good is it if it's not going to let me use it?,
So far Todoist has helped me maintain and complete tasks that would otherwise be missed. Easy to use and reliable.,
So efficient and easy to use. i love having my list everywhere no matter what device. I love being able to add items on particular days.,
"Really great app, but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature: notifications for a timed reminder.",
This is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing. You pay not good at all With free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app,
"Hamstringed app that just tried to get you to spend $36 for timed reminders etc. Just use Any.do or any other task app, and you can get all of this apps functionality for much cheaper. SCAM!",
"Wow, this is so slick. Has to be the most polished app I have ever used. Not really surprised as the web, Windows and iOS are all superb as well. This is so worth the $4 a month.",
"I am one of the oldest todoist user and this app has sorted my life like anything, kudos to you guys for creating such a useful app. I would urge to just add one more feature which shows the month view.",
"Excellent todo list app for personal use. smart text interpretation, reminders, sub projects, it has everything.",
"Neat, easy to use and a clean design. Would have been the best if the activity log wasn't a premium feature.",
Spent 5 minutes trying to create a recurring task and failed. Setting up a reminder for a task is a premium feature? Seriously?,
"Pretty much all my ""life"" schedule is organized by todoist. Happy to pay for premium package as well, very much worth it whether you are a professional or a student and so on, so on. Recommend!",
"Thank you for letting me know, I will take a look to try it again, and update my review at that time ------ Looking to set reminders, but alarms are only on premium feature so I can't even confirm if this app can do what I need it to do before purchasing.",
It has been a great tool for keeping track of whats due in all my classes. It also helps me to plan my weekly schedule better.,
Keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project. This app will definitely help you in all the ways it can. Great for increasing productivity.,
After Wunderlist was bought out I had chose this app as the next big todo list app. It offers the most integrations and advanced functionality than any of its competitors.,
Not sure what happened with the redesign. None of my tasks are visible in the projects or inbox. Unusable right now.. Edit issue fixed by dev,
I have been using it for about a week and it has honestly helped me keep me priorities straight for stuff like school work. If you having hard time deciphering which thing to tackel first or just want a to do list I recommend this app,
Reminders require Premium. I only have the free version for now. I'd like to have it on my phone too but apparently it isn't compatible with my phone. Not sure why.,
Great app with no ads disrupting experience. You can share tasks with other people and has lots of customizable options.,
I really like having the 7 Day widget on my homescreen. Helps me to keep important to dos on my radar eg. Was gonna rate it 4 stars at first bc some of the stuff is paid for but then again they gotta make a living somehow...,
"Easy to use, helps me note things quickly, works across my devices. Has a nifty widget too. Still using the free version and loving it so far.",
"And app requiring my email address just to see what it offers gets an automatic one-star review and deleted from my phone. If you want to make money of my PII, I want to see what I'm getting in return first.",
Very good app. Some features are non-intuitive which reduces the rating by a star. Otherwise very good.,
Seems great so far. If you add an option to make the widget clear or transparent I'll give you money for premium. *edit- they literally added this for me in less than a week,
Sayonara Wunderlist. I used it for a year and didn't know what I was missing. Know all those Wunderlist features that you've been Googling that only come up in forums as user suggested features? Todoist has them.,
This app has been worth the equivalent of thousands of dollars to me in saved time and productivity since I started using it four years ago. It's one of my favorite apps I've ever found. I cant recommend it highly enough.,
"Don't bother unless you want to pay. A lot. There are free apps (or Post-it Notes) that do everything this does, much, much more inexpensively.",
The free option has all the features I need. An alarm would be nice but since I don't have the premium I'll do without for now.,
"So far, I'm just trying to move the constant cyclone of ""Did I take my vitamins?"" ""I need to call the dentist"" ""Let's learn Arabic for some reason, did we practice today?!"" out of my head and into an app, and this has worked fairly well for that. Plus Hannah Witton uses it and she rules, so good enough.",
"Very helpful and easy to use to help organise day to day tasks, even the free version has enough featurss to organise yourself efficiently.",
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.,
What kind of app doesn't support 2FA in 2021? Seriously todoist. People have voted for this feature and requested it numerous times. Shameful security practice. I love this app and I have found it useful but please add support for 2fa!,
"I use it for everything- grocery list, agendas, homework, etc! It's the best tool and I love that it can sync to my Google calander!",
Very easy to use and sub task feature is great. Would love a separate grocery list feature incorporated.,
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders,
"Everything is great, But it would be nice to have a habit tracking option or maybe something like daily planner.",
"My go-to app for checking off to-do lists. Simple, smooth and easy to operate. Highly recommend it to everyone üòÄüòäüòÄ",
"Great to do app I love being able to check off items as I do them. I also like the labels, filters, and projects (premium)",
"I've been using this app for a couple of years now, and I still love it. I use it instead of a calendar and to-do list. The only little thing I wish was different is that I'd like there to be a way to scroll further into the future than just 7 days (next 30 days maybe?).",
This simple app has transformed our business by allowing my boss and I to share a task list. Board view needs to make it to the Windows app though.,
Excelent tool. I use it every day. It has helped me to keep track of pending tasks that would normally get lost if I keep it only in my mind.,
"It's like a to do list, but broken up so it's less manageable. And who doesn't want an email every morning saying 'Here's everything you didn't accomplish yesterday.'",
The best organising app I have ever used. Very intuitive and very well designed. It has been a huge help.,
Excellent app with useful features to get stuff done! Thankfully not bloated with ads or useless features. Highly recommend!,
You have to pay to get simple feature like reminder. What a pathetic way to get paid subscribers. Company only care about money. I don't care about your fancy feature of subtasks or what not but reminder should be free feature.,
"You have to pay for alerts, which defeats the purpose. But it's simple and organized well. Good if you remember to check it.",
Used to be Any.do user for many years but getting buggy thus making the switch over & never look back. This app rocks in every ways.,
"I love this app so far. It has helped me maintain my focus during the day and remember what us important to me, rather than reacting to unscheduled interruptions that steal time.",
it works. but WAY TOO EXPENSE and compkicated than most user will need. this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating.,
"I love being able to empty my brain out in this app for all the stuff I need to get done, so I don't have to try and remember everything. I sleep much better at night with less worry!",
"Wish there was a little bit more flexibility for notes, etc. Overall great for a free app.",
Great app. I look forward to using it everyday. The only issue I have is it should have better integration with Google Home or Alexa.,
Satisfied with its user friendly options except that some basic features like reminders are unavailable in free version.,
"This app, along with Cave Days and the Freedom app, are helping to completely transform my relationship to my work and my ability to organize and implement projects and goals. I highly recommend it!",
This is a very well designed app. I especially love the ability to share lists with my wife and make comments back on forth on specific tasks.,
This app is super easy to use and very helpful for tracking tasks. Haven't used all the features yet but loving it so far!,
Helful and easy to use. Easy to transfer tasks to a new day. Not overly complicated interface.,
"Helps me keep everyhthing I have todo in one place since using it I haven't forget any task. Work, Personal and more work non stop todo lists with no stress.",
Why i couldn't add a widget where i can manage all the tasks I've scheduled for a week? The only widget that is available is the widget where it will help mo to directly open the app. Looks like the old version was more helpful.,
Why editing task is so difficult. Intuitively I long press to edit but no response. Then I have to figure out here and there to find how to edit.,
My favourite app! My life is so much more organised and easy now that i can add in anything and everything that needs yo to be done for the week or day in one place.,
After one week of using Todoist I have realized how many tasks i used to postpone. Both computer and phone app helped me with completing all of them and I will definitely recommend it to everybody from now on.,
Super app. One of features to add to basic version is type of calendar task distribution to visualise your week/month/year.,
App requires registration to start usage. Seriously!? I thought that email doesn't required for offline todo list. Why I need to register if I don't want to use optional online features?,
Still love Todoist. Works well all these years. It works well with no crashes or force closing. Works as it says on the tin Thanks Todoist team. üëçüèæ,
"This is more than a to-do app. It's part philosophy, grounded in solid time management and productivity principles. I believe that's what sets this app apart.",
Immediate uninstall and 1 star rating because you have to PAY FOR PREMIUM in order to access the REMINDER function - utter foolishness! The whole purpose of me looking for a To Do List app is so that I can be reminded of my daily tasks.,
Seems almost perfect. I'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks/assignments/etc.,
Really good app. Edit 9/15/21: Still not happy about the 5 projects limit but the technical team was responsive and bugs have been fixed quickly.,
Absolutely amazing app for helping you to organise projects at home and at work and actually get stuff done. Get it you won't regret it.,
This has become my go to task tool. it's multiplatform with a load of features but doesn't overwhelm you. fantastic natural language support for scheduling.,
It's a wonderful app. It's very easy to define the dates to be reminded which is unlike the traditional to-do apps.,
"Very helpful and convenient for forgetful, disorganized, or even well organized people -when I manage to check it that is...",
Extremely usefull application. You can use it on both pc and mobile with automatically updated lists.,
being given productivity through this allows me to really categorise my teeth and activities and projects I'm working on. I also use it as my mind on Friday just dump everything and any idea that comes up during the day and it does a really good job but classifying them,
"Sophisticated and Well designed to-do app, that works as a complete package even on free version. Personally, it's the best to-do app ever made.",
"Clean UI, and great integration with the desktop and web apps. The to-do list I always come back to.",
"So bloody good. I dont pay for apps, but i had to pay for this because of how good it is. The design thinking that has gone into this has thought of everything I've needed to far. Im writing this review because the app deserves it.",
"By default tasks are due today and it's not easy to find the option to change this. I wanted to save time, not spend time learning another tool. Uninstalling.",
"I've been feeling more completed lately. Like the things that I might normally be forgetting to do are now finally getting done. Every day. And I love finishing everything for the day and getting that message that says ""Take the afternoon off, good work!"" üòÜ",
Simple and easy to use. It should automatically sort by date though. You have to resort each time you enter something,
"Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users.",
Perfect and simple to use. Just what was needed to keep my buisness organised and staff up to date with tasks.,
learning to be more disciplined. this app helps me a lot... Only thing is that if the developers could make the reminder feature free it would be great.,
Meets my need to have an ever evolving list. Like calendar function and how it sends reminders. Keeping me on task.,
"todoist is simple and performs exactly as i need it to, no more no less. simple andstraight forward it is a great management app!!",
"I love this app. Its really quite simple and productive. It made me very organized this past few months and Im really grateful for it. By the way, I shared this to my friends in class.",
This app opens with a slow loading screen followed by making me wait for an animation to finish. I immediately quit and uninstalled.,
Premium version give you anything you could possibly want in a task organizer for business. Free version is great as a personal task organizer.,
"The new update is remarkable. Best todo list app available, though still has some issues with task scheduling that causes sub task duplication.",
Horrible platform. Nothing is easy and it wont let you change a date and no save button. Un-installed within hours,
"I love this app. Gets me to sort my minds daily tasks on the go as fast and as efficient as possible. Superb, gets the job done!",
In my opinion there isn't a better task management system than Todoist and the Andoid app and included widget are excellent. I have integrated Todoist with Ganttify and my calendar and manage all my tasks and projects with that combination.,
Do you what makes this app great and so superior than other? It allows me to sync my tasks to google calendar!!!! Do you know how hassle free my task list and schedule now? It's so bomb I love it!! TRY IT THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE!!!,
I like that you can repeat task in certain time period from completion date. This sets this app apart from most other to do apps.,
"Customizable, clean interface. Calendar integration. Cross platform. Very worthwhile.",
"Automatically completes task, for the day, as I open the program. I do not have any access to see what was completed or if I lost something important I have to do.",
You cant set reminders without paying. What is the point of an electronic to do list if you cant be reminded to do your tasts.,
Love the multilayer to do lists and the ease of organization. Breaking bigger tasks into smaller ones is a breeze!,
"I love this, is free, easy, adjustable, or simple a to keep list, and even if you forget you can always come back to the tasks later",
"I like the interface. Like any organizing app, the magic is in the user rather than the tool.",
Very easy to use and also syncs with my Fossil Sport smartwatch! Best to-do list app that I've used.,
Very simple clear helpful app. I usually can do lists but this makes it possible to make the most and actually refer to it again!,
it's not a user friendly app..too much complicated usage. it's of no use. don't have an option of recurring task.its not mobile friendly app... i prefer not use this app in my life.. waste of money and i dont know why this one cost is 300+ bucks..,
Great app. We'll integrated with my email client. Use on my Mac as well and everything works seamlessly. Using free version.,
"While adding time to a Task asked me to subscribe for premium üòÇ I said sorry, uninstalling. I can pay for an app for extra features but if I am expected to pay just for basic functionality then plz make it a paid app at the first place.",
"Google Calendar sync is fixed. I'm able to sync my tasks with my GCal, and the app is once again as useful as it always was.",
"I use this app more than 5 years and it's very productive. Now I have to report some problems & requests: 1. App widget have some problems like freezing in Microsoft luncher's feed. 2. You have many persian users from Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikestan and their immigrants around the world. So it's necessary to implement persian language and Jalali (Hijri Shamsi) calendar. For this requests you can use our persian users helps for translating and technical stuffs.",
"For the love of god explain me why there's no option to always show the tasks I've done??? I don't want to go to the main tab to the submenu, like WHY can't I reach today's ""done"" tasks from today tab??? And no option to make them not hidden as soon as a tap it done.",
Spiciest task management app around. Constantly pleasantly surprised when I discover new (and super useful!) features.,
I like how simple to use the app is. All basic functions that I need are covered in the basic version for free.,
"excellent for hobbies, work and projects. I really love it and it's really flexible. I use it all day as a premium user with no regrets! Love it",
"Fantastic, functional & user friendly. Todoist is responsible for a marked improvement in my productivity, and i will likely continue my membership for many years into the future.",
App worked great up until recent update that added check boxes..Now I keep accidentally marking tasks complete. Please add a setting to disable check boxes,
Really useful. I use it to organise my week and don't get stressed if I have to move tasks around to later days in the week.,
"Good app. I used it quite a bit, until the version changed and became incompatible with my phone.",
It has a lot of features. But I need simple one not that much complicated. I need one app which will manage my today task. It's good but not simple to use.,
"Definitely helps to keep on top of all my tasks. Easy to use interface, love being able to create projects.",
"Great interface, plenty of features. The app is easy to use and very helpful in managing my time.",
It's the perfect kind of list I've tried. Everything is great. It could be better if we had a calendar view as well.,
"I love it! Easy to navigate, prioritize, review, and helps I have yet to discover.",
I've started using Todoist again recently and fell in love with this app. It's one of the best list managers and the big advantage for me is that it is cross platform,
Easy to use and really customizable. I'm really enjoying it and it helps me keep everything organized. Definitely recommend.,
Seems like a great app if you didn't have to pay $36/year just to be reminded of a task. I deleted this app and will be downloading another one that won't try to take my money.,
Basic functions work all well. Good UI and sectionings of works. Will get you through the basic needs.,
"Like it so far, will see how it holds up Update after 1 year: stable, clean, intuitive interface, bump review to 5 stars",
"Excellent user experience. It has become a daily necessity for plannijg my days, weeks ,months and life.",
"It is simply amazing, by far the best to do list and productivity tool I have ever use. I definitely recommend it. For what it's worth, I never rate apps but this one really deserved it.",
"good app, but UI is confusing and smart date recognitions is buggy/doenst work: when i for example set the date to 3.5.2022 it will choose the 5th of march even tho i set the date format to DD/MM/YY using the 3/5 format unfortunately doenst fix the issue",
"Great app that helps me keep track of tasks. I love that I can connect with my husband and we can crest a project board with tasks that we both need to do, and who will do each one.",
Lacking calendar/monthly overview to be able to perceive tasks & projects also in a timely manner! So that essential dimension is just missing.,
"This app is interesting and easy to use, the best feature is that i can put the time in the description of the schedule, thats impressive",
has really helped me with large projects and to follow the bullet journal method of giving each task a date/time instead of keeping one long list.,
"After much research and using many different apps, I've settled on todoist as the most comprehensive and practical for my needs. I use a combination of GTD and other tools, and todoist copes well with them all",
A fantastic app for trying to manage your life and time.. yet still fail. But the app actually makes me remember that I have something to do. But still.. I won't do it.. for.. reasons.,
"It helps me to stay focus throughout the day. With priority option, i can decide which task i need to be done first. This apps is useful! Awesome!",
"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task.",
"So my keyboard recommended you, but you have no way for me to get help... I just had one simple question but the only help available is articles you choose to show...and only business customers get to interactive with you so since I couldn't contact you & i HATE secretive businesses so I'm here to tell you I am now not interested in your product (I was initially)... Good luck with the business customers since that's what you care about more. The end...",
"looks great, but reminders/notifications are a premium feature. Google calendar is better.",
"It's really a great to do list app, must try. But this app is lagging after latest update or maybe because I integrated Google Calendar and then removed it. Please help",
Solid free app. Being locked out of extra functionality with a paywall is a little irksome but nothing I can't got over. It does what I need it to.,
Very useful and hopefully more features for the free version. Have to pay for a lot of basic usages.,
This app has helped reduce my anxiety tremendously!! Being able to write down my daily tasks (no matter how menial) has been a game changer!,
"The App works wonderfully, i love it. But, it could work best with an alarm to notify you of the task/s at hand.",
Best 'to do list' app hands down. Been using for 3 years. Android + mac integration is spot on. I genuinely love it. So so so useful,
absolute productivity enhancer. Thank you for this amazing app. Looking forward to stick with it till i stick with technology.,
"I have been enjoying this app for a good while, over a year now. The recent update moved this app from ok, useful with some mild frustration, to amazing. Super pleased with this fix.",
So far so good. Very convenient especially the split into parts features. I'm a happy user.,
"Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete",
"You can't do anything with the free version. You get 5 lists or projects. So maybe if I lump everything under Business and Personal I can do something, but I can't really organize.",
"Fantastic App! Very user friendly, but loving the reminders and multiple options for organization.",
This is so rad. It's so easy. This works with my brain. I made all the lists and categories on my laptop and now I just add to them as needed on the app.,
Very easy experience making and completing tasks. Main reason I chose this app is because I can choose to make the take on my phone or in the desktop,
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap.",
It's nice but is it required that we really need to pay just for a timer? I mean other apps have premium too but they didn't lock the timer for tasks. Kinda frustrating to use the app.,
Love it but would like the widget to have a way to enter the full app like it used to. There's some things that are not accessible in the widget,
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing",
Enjoying it so far. I just cant seem to sync it with my calendar so I get no notifications for my to-do list and I need to open the app to check I need to do.,
I don't know what is going on The app works fine on my pc But on my phone it's keeping loading the content with blank page It may be a sync bug Hope you fix it,
"Flexible, Fast and Multi-Platform! Loving all of the capabilities Todoist offers - especially the Outlook and Gmail plug ins.",
"Hi, todoist team Android app is suddenly including brackets „Äê„Äë whenever I am trying to assign a project and a flag or PRORITY to a task.. request you to please fix the same example - Error sample [Out] [Personal]",
"Just a really good tasks app. Great syncing across the web, and a tidy interface.",
"As part of an overall strategy of organizing my life and using other apps to track my moods, meditate, and limit my time on social media, this app is an incredibly positive addition to my life.",
I downloaded the app yesterday. It was working well until today but now whenever I clicked on it shuts down and keep telling the app has a bug so I should contact the developers.,
"almost all that i need for a powerfull todo list, as a freelancer i want to use for work also, but we need more functional between tasks. meybe some agile, scrum, ... platforms integrations üòú",
I use this app everyday! It helps me keep up with what I have to do and shows me how often I put things off. Very organized and useful.,
"Been using this for a while now, it's good and I prefer it over other to-do list type apps. The app does everything it's advertised to and performs very well. üëç",
Tried several times to sign up and each time it said my password/s were too easy to guess and to choose a stronger password. I gave up and uninstalled.,
"New changes to free plan make app useless without subscription, putting crazy limits on features free users depend on. Total bait and switch.",
"Excellent app. I use it constantly. I love how this syncs between my phone, work computer, and home computer.",
"Best todo app ever. I use it every day, and I couldn't live without it. The best feature is the auto-tagging of input text.",
Definitely my go to auto fill password app. Makes switching from ios to android so much easier as I use them both for work and personal.,
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.,
"very inconvenient, too large interface for task bullet (very few tasks show on the screen). overall VERY limited functionality",
"It can be a little ruff to learn, but is so useful for ppl like me that have trouble with memory. The widget makes it alot easier for me.",
Really a very good task list manager and much more. I use it to plan my day and store materials for future use. It's an excellent app and I expect to use it long into the future.,
I love this app. Perfect for organizing all my homework assignments! Clean layout and easy to use.,
Old ui have facilities to click on the task and you can close or rename or edit the task but new one have some limitations so please roolback to old ui that is very good for all we are 40 users and all have problem,
It works great! Easy to input tasks and sort them. I am only using the non-premium version but I love it already!,
"Showing an already tick for recurring task will be helpful. Other than that, It was very convenient.",
Very useful especially if you're a forgetful person that has a lot of things to do. Customer Service is responsive too! Recommended!,
good app. but there is a fault. items are not arrange (sort) automatically by date in both app and widget. please fix this.,
It's very easy to get started using the app in a simple way and then grow to use some of the more advanced features. I like the UI. So far so good!,
I didn't care for some features because I had trouble using it but I had mixed feeling about a team to help keep me on task.. but I need that sometimes I like some free apps more .,
easy way to list daily tasks and create recurring ones. I like thst the lists are synchronized between phone & laptop.,
"It's just awesome. I tried a few different tasks managers before but I wasn't really happy with any of them. This one is so well made, though, I would recommend it to everyone, who wants to organize his life.",
"by far the best Todo app I've ever used,and I've used plenty...the design,the minimalistic look and feel,the many features under the hood....its awesome...highly recommended",
"Cracking app, surprised it's free. It's just like my old filofax. List what you need to do in order of importance and urgency, works really well, especially for an old duffer like me",
"Have been suffering with ADD for a long time, Todoist is one of the only apps that has helped me to function and stay on task. A life saver in the most literal way.",
"I really like it, it's great. The location based notifications are perfect for my ADHD mind.",
"Layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm, reminder etc are available only in premium version.",
"You will be asked to upgrade to a premium just for the sake of adding reminders. Well that is not satisfying, reminders should be available just in the beginning.",
"This is just for latest update. The UI gets blank, the tasks don't show and it keeps hanging .... Please fix the bugs",
To remove my account I have to install the app? What poltroon designed this? You'd have to be addled to think this is a good idea. I get email spam and to stop it I have to reinstall the app? Beware getting this.,
"Basically perfect. I just wish there were a native UI for Linux, but the web app is solid enough that I'm satisfied.",
"I have used todoist for several years now and it is simply spot on. Easy to use, easy to customise as you wish and so useful. I can heartily recommend.",
"Almost perfect, the only thing is missing is a persistent notification that works like the widget, just to add quick things",
Easy to use tool for becoming more efficient with my limited time and multiple projects. Great reminder!,
"Hey folks, it's an app I've heard lot of great things about, but it's not opening for me! I'm on Redmi note 8 pro. Can you please look into it? Thanks! I'll change the review as soon as it works. Best of luck!",
Been using todoist for around 3 years now...it helps me keep track of everything! Also love how easy it is to reschedule the to-dos that don't get done.,
"After connecting my Google account, the app is stuck loading the front page. I can't do anything on the app. Restarting the app and my phone didn't help.",
"It took less than an hour for the developer to start spamming my email, so this app was uninstalled within 1 hour. No idea how good it is. The day after uninstall, i keep receiving spam...",
"As a GTD and productivity enthusiast, I think Todoist is the best task manangement app on the market. Simple, yet it has all the advanced functionality you need to effectively manage your work.",
"super handy... quick set up and entry of tasks, clean interface, good function set for free version.",
"Todoist is enjoyable for me to enter, organize, prioritize and plan what I want to do, to remember and keep lists like wish lists.",
"I'm still learning and I like the app, but I wish there were task durations and I wish I could easily review tasks that I have accomplished.",
"This is definitely the all round to do list app that I need. Nice UI, text recognition, and tasks management",
"I love this app, this fit my needs. I would give 5 star if you also put a calendar widget, then this app would be perfect. I highly recommend it.",
"Greatest App I have ever used. Well thought out, organized, the only App I can honestly say that I use every single day. Never forget a thing! Helps me sleep better at night.",
Really well thought out app. I like how flexible it is and the way subtasks are visible within the project.,
"My go-to task list app. I basically run my whole life through Todoist, it has great UI and it syncs super well.",
"Great app and it really helps me stay on top of things, though I do wish I could be able to put events in too for example :friends birthday from maybe 10 am to 2 pm and things like that",
"It was working fine until last update. Now it can't recognise what date I'm typing. Instead today ""at 10"" it skips to some other day. It is very annoying to use app like this",
Really been useful in keeping me productive and on track. I've started over after a recent kidney transplant and this app has helped me keep the structure I need in my life.,
This used to be my go to app. Now you have to pay for even the smallest features like setting a time on your reminder. Uninstalling and finding another.,
Makes me feel very productive. nice app. i like the fact that there is a chrome extension for this app so i can sync my to do list on my laptop and phone.,
App is great as a Wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money? It is not possible. Unfortunately i won't use this app.,
Perfectly easy to use and follow. I appreciate the reminders every day too. I accidentally ended up relying on this app instead of my calendar app. It's just so much better!,
GAME CHANGER!! It's multi functional so you can view what you need without being overwhelmed yet super easy to use.,
"Great app, I love how well thought UX it has. Thanks to the free month to try it I could really try if the app is good for me and now I am happy premium customer because it is by far the best app for todos. I am using it for my a bit enhanced GTD and my productivity has actually skyrocketed ever since I use Todoist üòä",
"Please add the task anounser in this app. Because, if we are away from yhe mobile then we can easily leason it . But now it only remember us in the form of notification but i want it as like alarm means more sound please please solve my problem please",
"Good App, the only things I would add is a visual user face and remove the glitch of prevously typed task being posted with the new ones.",
"todoist is easy to use, has all the features I want, and really organizes my life. game changer, highly recommend!",
Was great before the new 'redesign'. Now it's a PITA to reschedule things. I wish they'd stop messing with things. May have to check out a different app,
"I like the concept but it is very complicated, specially entering recurring tasks or editing.",
Anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless. Uninstalled.,
Successfully used this app to manage my professional and personal life over several years since first installation. I cannot speak highly enough of its reliability and ease of use.,
"Best to-do/productivity app. Amazing and feature-rich, clean and organized look. 10/10.",
I love using this app. I moved from Wunderlist (canned by Microsoft) to To Do and the featuers of Todoist are the most intuitive and helpful.,
Great program to keep myself organized. I just found out that I can send projects to my employee and they update on his app as I update mine which is very useful for work.,
Absolutely great app. Use it to monitor my packed engineering college schedule. It works across my phone and computer! Can't recommend enough,
By far the best app I have ever managed to find for productivity üôå Brilliant in every way. I'm addicted and feel like I am achieving much more without feeling overwhelmed.,
"I suggested this in the past, but the ability to set a persistent reminder, like an alarm, would be a great addition to the app.",
I couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks.,
"when you use it like it's designed, it helps incredibly to get your task laid out, your life organized, and things accomplished.",
"Since last major update, rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled, preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day. Productivity killer.",
"Good application, it keep me focused on my goals. One downside is whenever I put a new task on a specific day it doesn't areange it automatically, i have to do this manually",
"Latest update causes app to crash and stop syncing. Quick response and an update later, seems fixed. Thanks team",
"Solved: my two filters' queries was replaced the string ""query"". -> logged out and re-logged in the app and the queries were recovered. Thanks so much ‚ú®",
"quite a few tasks are unavailable unless you pay. I like the reminders, but think I will stay with my Outlook calendar",
Why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app.. what dev.. you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that. Ridiculous.. uninstalled.. just needed a to do list app as simple as that.,
Clean interface that doesnt get in the way. Also enjoy how it parses your tasks for things such as due dates.,
Absolutely love the app but the new checkboxes take up too much space. Please add an option to hide them.,
"Very easy to use. Love that I can just type ""tomorrow"" or ""Friday"" and it knows to just add it to that particular day. Very intuitive to use.",
I just love this app! I link this to my laptop one too! My organization in tasks and to-do lists have never been more satisfied with an app!,
"Brilliant, some quirks but once you learn them then its great. Love its ability for sharing into todoist as comments and tasks, from other apps.",
"Great app. I'm a 'list person' and am loving this app as i no longer have loads of paper lists, and have my list handy wherever /whenever i want it now :)",
"very useful, especially since it synchronises with your account and can be updated from all your devices!",
"great design, intuitive, and a very robust free version that is not intrusive with ads on every action",
I started using this for 1 week and I already fall in love with the product. The app is simple and intuitive yet powerful enough to make your days much more productive.,
Simple. Brilliant. Love some of the extra features like sending via email and all that.,
The ability to easily reschedule tasks I can't complete today is SUPER helpful - and makes it easier to end my day with a clean slate!,
"Great app, easy to use, no bumps or lumps so far, no annoying 24/7 interruptions like a lot of apps produce !!!",
It's easy to set up but one downside is that to set a reminder on a task I have to upgrade to premium and its not something I wanted to begin with,
I use to love this app until their current terms of service. It gives them a license to use my data any way they want without limitation. NO THANKS!,
Even though you pay for a subscription. It doesn't save your previous lists of you stop paying for a month. Sucks.,
"have been using it for years. very quick and easy to add a to do with the project hashtag and date tags (eg ""tomorrow"" auto adds it to my list for tomorrow).",
"Really good app and nice design, nice features! Unfortunately no reminders option for the free use, no one time purchase option",
Been using for more than a year now.. the way to set up recurring tasks is a game changer. It really helps me to be more productive.,
"so far, this app has been my way of organizing my tasks and myself. i'm glad that it's also integrated with Google Home so i can check my tasks as i dress up every morning for work. good job!",
Really helps me keep my projects in order. I always have 10-15 construction jobs going at one time. Being able to walk in a house and making my list by project with reminders and emails is awesome,
i used to have severe prejudice towards planner apps but this one certainly made it beyond. The free version does what pro versions from other app offer. Looking forward to upgrading later.,
"I just would like to have also the possibility to set and see the amount of time estimated per each task or group of tasks, otherwise I am just in love for the app.",
very intuitive and easy to figure out. good team collaboration too. helpful notifications.,
"Great helper in my everyday life. I use it literally every day and all the time! Thanks a lot for your work, I really appreciate it. And I like articles from the Doist team! You're great!",
To-do lists are the most powerful tool if you want to be much productive. Todoist is one of the bests in this era. Highly recommended!,
"I really enjoy this app, it is great when u haven't completed the thing you were supposed to do so it sends u a little reminder. I would highly recommend.",
"Its a really good app, but I wished that I am able to see the full agenda through the widget and not just for the next week. Maybe there's an option for that but couldn't find it.",
"Fantastic app, excellent service!  Moved to this from Toodledo, and couldn't be happier.  The Todoist team actually built a high quality Android app.  Thanks!",
"Really great app that has helped keep me on track as I juggle work, studying and home life. Premium is well worth the price if you use it daily.",
Great app and constantly improving. Appreciate the hard work by developers which made a difference üëç However agree with other users that the ability to open the app from the widget was helpful and was taken away,
Been using the free version for a week now. Really helping me keep track of my work and personal tasks. Love being able to use it on my desktop and phone,
"Enjoying the app, but can't figure out how to get it on my Galaxy Active 2 watch. Whenever I try to find the app for it, I get directed to the phone app.",
This app helps a lot with organising my life. its not complicated to enter things and it's easy to form habits because it runs simply.,
"Hi there , can you add a option to select all task and delete in the show complete task section ? Is quite annoying you have to select each of the task and delete . Thank you",
Fantastic design and functionality. Pls update to new Google material design and add a calendar widget. That'd be awesome.,
"Works really well. A great to do list app, while offering so much more, even on the free plan. 10/10.",
"Very well designed. Natural language is very useful. Works well on Android, Windows and Web",
"Please I need help. When I try to log in with Google in the app, it said ""Unknown error occurred. Please check again in a few seconds"". I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but no such lucküò¢",
"Exceptional experience !! Thanks to all the team. I don't see any mistake for the moment,but surely, you can increase the app. Courage !!",
"Todist is intuitive, easy to use and effective. It gives you all the functionality needed to manage all of your activities no matter the size or complexity.",
"It's easy to add all my task and schedule them. Even I can create projects and many other things. After starting using this app, things are in my control",
It is easy to use and fits my needs pretty much. Cost and time on the task level would be a 5 star review,
"so far, better than any other app doing the same. very easy to use, but the free version, which we use now, lack of many features we found in others.",
"Seems to be a good one, but some critical options and features will only be available when you upgrade your app which demands some money per month.",
"The best to-do app out there, for certain. Downside: not compatible with Android System-wide dark mode.",
"Better than MS To Do. Almost as good as Wunderlist. Only thing missing is the gratifying ""ding"" sound when checking things off.",
Simple and easy to use. Available for windows too so i can sync with my laptop. Good eficiency.,
"not bad for organizing, would be nice if you could set tasks to repeat as necessary, or allow you the option to categorize tasks",
"I used many todo apps ,but this app has fullfield my need for having a board for tasks that i don't know even when i gonna start ,to my daily habits that no longer to be recreated and can be scheduled percically and also normal todo task",
The most expansive task management system I have ever had the pleasure of working with. If you are following the Getting Things Done methodology by David Allen there is no better one than this!,
"Great app, only using the free version. Its a bit expensive for me to get to full version, but i love how easy it is to use and the practicality is great!",
I truly love this app. It helps me my daily act together and look ahead at my week. It's simple to use and I love the ability to break down big projects.,
Simple. Organized and yet flexible. Wish the alarm feature for to do items was on the free,
I would like to be able to move multiple tasks as subtasks instead of one at a time. That is the only criticism I have the rest is awesome!,
"- installed this app to compare with Google tasks, which is free - realized I can't create reminders with the free version, which I can with Google tasks - uninstalled after a few minutes - receiving email spam for 4 days now Come on, guys.",
"Reminders are premium feature ? really ? i understand you need premium subscription to make the company survive , but making the main functionallity of a ""to do "" app premium is a bit much. no thanks .",
Why didn't I find this app earlier? Great app!! Since I started using this app I have been working faster towards accomplishing my goals. Very easy to navigate and is a definite game changer. Shared it with everyone and now you üòÉ,
This app was really helpful for me and made my daily life easier. Unfortunately the last update with the new HUD has completely destroyed my workflow.,
"Updated to pro but reminders are VERY clunky. Why should I physically write when I want a reminder, why can't I just use the same UI as when I schedule it (that is, by using the clock)?",
"Doesn't let you say you did something yesterday, which is for me a big deal, as I browsed the options looking for a way to do that almost everything was only a premium option",
"I keep coming back to todoist... why is that? ive tried 30+ task managers, but keep coming back. You definitely need to review your tasks weekly but its just a reliable tool.",
Easy to use. Integration with other devices and applications are seamless. Well done with a slick app.,
I've never been able to stick to using a To Do list until now. Great interface and features.,
Used it for a month and am loving it so far. It would be great if you add a feature which lets you add an estimated time for a given task,
"Absolutely loving it, been using Todoist for years now and it only gets better with time. Simple, logical, and available both as an app and via web.",
"This app is so cool. Before using this app I used Google task and that was not that perfect but it was okay for me for a long time. But when I got Todoist app, it changed my whole experience. I highly recommend this app. This app is so fun to use. I love it.",
Very good app....good interface Easy entries and keywords Seeing Whole year review was truly good and that's why I came here to rate them. Thank you.,
Horrible update. It removed Sub-projects in widgets which is used to be very very very useful for a Neurosurgeon like me. Please update again so that I can use my widgets of sub projects.... please please please,
"Really great. It is clear & effective. I can create my own projects and follow them, It shows me tasks from yesterday that I forgot to do and so forth.",
love it! love how it lets me edit on Android widget. also love the amount of subcategories there are! lots of options and pretty easy to figure out.,
"Intuitive UI, but no way to customize fields. Also no reminders for free accounts.",
"Todoist sent me a welcome email, although I never signed up. Now I'm getting email reminders for a task related to crypto currency. Hackers are using this platform for social engineering and fraud. Todoist, please do more to verify new accounts.",
Easy to use app. Well designed interface. Email and phone notifications are very useful,
Great application! Since I started to use it just cannot stop. Really improves your time management skills.,
the app is working well for me so far. somethings i wish it had. 1. A description space for each project (to write the goal statement) 2. End date for each project 3. an option to feature a task in more than one project,
I really enjoy the app. It's very efficient and helps me stay motivated about getting stuff done throughout the day.,
"Love the options for managing individual tasks, and that I can also interact with the list via web browser.",
Very easy to setup a project and creating subtasks required; and checking out completed tasks - achieved when subtasks menu is empty. üò∫ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è,
Easy to use and works well across devices. having reminders set by location is pretty nifty.,
"Didn't stick with todoist in the past, merely because there was only one subtask level. Now there are 4. Todoist is the best. Hands down.",
Was a waste of money and time. More time making/managing to-do lists than doing the projects. Not worth the money.,
This is a great tool to keep me on track with my tasks. The recurring options are very flexible!,
"Could somebody explain how do i make this app send me a notification at a scheduled time of my reminder? Right now it works like a list of reminders, that don't remind me to do anything at a time.",
Todoist feels like magic on UI part. NO other app in entire universe look beautiful. Rest is all good. Although I am not using it because notification is not free and Its far precious than i can afford,
The most simple and best user friendly app but as a productivity tool it lacks some features like a weekly view and setting days (not just date),
"Would be a great app if notifications worked. I only get the daily notification, no others for specific tasks set to be done at specific times.",
"Working like PA, always behind me to complete the task. IAM new this but good experience, I would like know about full function of the app then I can give more and better Reviews.",
"Its a really great app! I love all the different things you can filter by - project, tab, priority, date. Awesome üëå",
This app has changed my life. I used to be a procrastinator but with the help of this app I have taken control over my behavior. I would highly recommend if you struggle with getting things done.,
The best Todo organiser I've used. available on all devices I've used and syncs perfectly. Can't really ask for more,
This is a great app used it for quite a while but lately now when I try to add projects in the app not on the web it doesn't add my projects just takes the phrase and puts brackets around it,
"Worth getting Premium, I miss having Things from iOS but now that I have an Android I use this! I tried all the other to-do apps and found this one to be the best available!",
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app,
"Very nice! Wish it was completly free, but obviously the creators gotta make money. No ads, very smooth, must use app for productivity!",
"Amazing, easy to use system that works well offline and synchs seamlessly with the chrome extension.",
It is a great app. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications,
"It's a SUPER COOL app! BUT it would be EVEN COOLER if we could customise the rank names we get after a particular number of Karma? ALSO, just a suggestion, but can we have the ability to customise what we want to call Karma? Like for example, we want to call Karma as Mana or EXP but it still has the same function as Karma. I think that would be AMAZING if it were to be implemented. (‚óï·¥ó‚óï‚úø)",
it works great for simple tasks that I always seem to forget to do like pick up dry cleaning or call insurance agent.,
"This tool, once setup to your style, does an excellent job of keeping you organized and on task.",
I am extremely happy with the app. This app is user-friendly and Absolute best reminder app in the market. I would encourage others to use this app as daily reminder app. Thank you todoist team Fantastic job & Keep it up!,
Requires login/account I don't see any reason to require a login for to do list management. Not clear whether it will work when the device is offline.,
"excellent app i use it with work projects and college studies, great tool for both would recommend to anyone wanting to be more organized",
It's a gr8 app. Very useful for daily planners. But i would suggest it to have even weekly as well as a monthly planner.,
"Login required. A to do list should not require an internet connection, let alone login. I would rather pay with cash than with data.",
No week numbers!! The app very well built but there is no option to enable week numbers. Please add week numbers features in coming updates.,
"This app is a game changer. Google Calendar is awesome, but this app takes productivity to another level.",
10/10 recommend. I've tried a good amount of reminder apps but I love the simplicity and ease of this app. It also has a lot of cool features.,
"Perfect task tracking app I absolutely love automatically set repeated tasks. For example, you write ""pay rent every 25th"" and the task sets repeat every 25th day of month",
"Touch & go, plus Google Assistant stated: it's not support with devise (integration). I'm using a Android phone and have the app on it.",
"Absolutely fantastic app! I've read many complaints about the lack of flexibility of the app, but I think that there's plenty of wiggle room for personalization. I rate it 5 stars. Why does it show one star then? Because the app prompted me to give a review :)",
Totally love this app! I had no idea they had something like this. You have no idea how much of a relief it is to have something that I can keep organized and get those 'things to remember' out of my head! I don't have to worry about forgetting anything!,
did it help with getting my tasks done ? id say yes to an extent. even if I procrastinated a bit it is very satisfying to check the boxes when done. i didnt delete the app right away. still have it,
"I've been using it for years, it was great, all of a sudden I can't create more than five projects because it's a pro feature. Disappointing.",
"it all what we need. Its simple, intuitive and look minimalist.",
"Just let me buy the pro app, why does every thing have to be subscription based? I simply want reminder functionality and it'll cost me 4 bucks a month in perpetuity for that VERY basic function.",
i feel like im more productive durring the day and i can get more done. i like with the premium you get more features like the colors. i change my colors out every month.,
Nice clean app (I use it for personal non-work-related projects). I use it to remind me to do things instead of just watching Netflix.,
lets me make tasks with reminders. which is all i need. they charge for that though. theres probably an app out there that would let me do that for free. but im using this one that is not free.,
"The google calendar integration is awesome, this feature alone makes it better than most other todo apps. Really enjoying it",
perfect solution. I was in trouble about finding best solution for my daily to do listing. After i use this app I niticed that I alteady found the perfect solution. Thanks!,
"Really useful as a college student, but would prefer an easier way to avail the student discount.",
It's great for organising but the app is bugging out. A lot of tapping etc makes events disappear!,
"I BOUGHT this app, then they switched to a subscription model. There should be something that grandfathers their existing customer base in, I'm not happy with this financial arrangement",
Loving this app! But there's a problem I'm facing that the widget doesn't get updated until I reboot the phone. Please fix this.,
i love the fact it won't come in your way but helps you track any task that cross your mind in middle of work so you can review and organize them later. Todoist made me a more productive Person. Thanks üôè‚ù§Ô∏è,
just great I recommend paying the subscription for the added benefits because this is the to do list that will never let you down. I use it on my pc/tablet/phone and its so seamless,
A light feel with heavyweight features ready to go! I've combined this with IFTTT and my mail to make flagged emails and email's keywords to pull tasks to Todoist. Love the web interface too!,
This is a very clever and intuitive app. for some reason the widget is slow to respond to taps.,
"I use this everyday to check off tasks and to remember tasks. I have used it for personal projects, family remodeling projects, and family shopping lists.",
This app has been a wonderful addition to my quest to being more productive. it's one of the few apps which I'm considering getting a paid subscription.,
I think this is exactly what I've been looking for since. This app is so perfect to track my daily method of operation DMO. I loved it. Keep it on and up. Thank you all for creating this app,
"It's really convenient and beauty app, but I need more functions and they are paid. Can I watch a lot of ads to have paid functions, please?",
This app keeps me working with no rest for the many things I scheduled for myself. I've should not have downloaded this app because it doesn't miss a thing.,
"Amazing, life changing. Just wish that the phone version showed all the project colours, please fix!",
It's a wonderful support to keep your schedules intact even when one is too busy to keep track of events..,
"How have I not given Todoist 5 stars yet? Love the web experience, and the app ia just one extension of that. I use the ""add task"" widget almost every day with google voice to text to take notes.",
Repeating previous posts- don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium. It's just a shell not worth the space it requires.,
I've tried a ton of todo list apps. This is the easiest and best one that syncs with web,
"amazing time management improvements- has changed the way I do things to make me not miss things, be more efficient and feel more confident because I know I'm organized.",
"Very easy to use from my laptop, tablet, or phone. I can't believe I stuck with paper lists for so long.",
"It was working perfectly, when it suddenly started glichibg and kicking me off the app every 3 seconds. I then deleted, and I'm using a different app now.",
"Works perfectly. Incredibly fair subscription system that's worth the money, but not necessary for a good user experience.",
"This sucks, entered a bunch of tasks and the app set them all to completed and removed them - now after start over! Using something else for sure.",
Simple and effective. Had a great experience using this app to help improve my productivity. Reminders were very helpful.,
I request you if it is possible then please add a list which shows all our comepleted/uncompleted tasks on the top with date and day so it would be a lot of favour on me I'm tired of finding my comepleted tasks in the huge list.,
"Really good for managing all my tasks for the day. I particularly love the widget, that always reminds me of my tasks.",
"Stupid app, only usefull for setting a to do list, which you could do with google docs or other things that you would usually already have, the reminders require payment, I would recommend using another app.",
"This app is simple and useful. I really didn't think I would use it, but after a week of entering all my tasks in the app I'm impressed. Again, simple and to the point.",
"I Iove this app. But I am so urgent to know can I make finished task as"" checked"" this allows me have overall look. But know I have to use ""undo"" to see fade color finished task. Please please reply thank you,",
"Very useful, quick to understand and start using, quite effective for managing general tasks or recurring reminders.",
"Incredible app! My life depends on it! So smooth, so user-friendly and so easy to use. Made my life much more productive! Thanks a ton to the development team!",
"Todoist is as simple as you want it to be or as complex as you need - it works great for organizing my tasks, whether they are work related or just personal things like chores",
Tried Trello too involved and expensive for small operation. Todoist Works beautifully and just what we need. They obviously care about taking good care of their application,
Intuitive and capable. Integrates well with Alexa. Couldn't enjoy it more.,
the best app i have found on play store to organize and prioritize my tasks and share the same with my friends and colleagues. Thanks to the team for making such a wonderful app.,
"Pretty happy with the app, but reminders are a paid feature. I think they should be free, because they are so basic for a todo app",
"i quite happy after using this app.Before this,I dont know what i should do in my life,everyday feeling guilty for not doing anytjing productive.But now I can set up my goals,the hobbies,learning plan in this app,then I just relax and see at ""Today"" section,i just complete the list then I will be good.Plan my life everyday,complete it everyday.Everyday is moving forward",
"Its the best and cleanest free app in the genre, i especially love it since its ad free and so easy to use, wonderfully designed with the user in mind",
I put everything in todoist. My day does not formulate without it. I know what I need to do next with todoist. Set things to be completed tomorrow or next month. Perfect for a person who needs organization to function......or else we don't know where to start. I love this app. I'll be a lifelong user.,
This app is easy to use and has helped me to get and stay organized. Honestly one of the best time management/to do apps I've ever used.,
Didn't like the interface and deleted the app. It started to sent me notifications to my email. Too annoying,
"Damn man! I am a graduate student in Civil Engineering. In this busy hectic schedule, I have to keep in mind about varoius doings throughout a day. This app surely made it a lot easier for me. Thanks and hats off to the devs. Take love. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
Can't manage my life without this app. Only issue I'm facing right now is that I get logged out of it often when using it through the chrome extension.,
Easy to use across all devices. Brilliant for keeping everything organised. Excellent app.,
"The free tier could allow more projects. 5 is pretty low. But the app is truly great, the best in this category for me.",
Great app. The only thing missing is tighter integration with Google Tasks (most of my tasks originate from email ang Google makes this extremely easy).,
Todoist has all the features I want and is simple to use. I have high hopes of it revolutionising my organisation and productivity.,
App consistently crashing within seconds of opening. Still crashes with latest update.,
All my unnecessary stress is gone. I tried other apps before but this 1 is the 1 i needed. FREE or $48 for a year ($4/month).. thanks so much for making it!,
Wasted too much of my life trying to get a receipt for my expenses (twice) and finally gave up. Probably because i downgraded back to free. I promise never to use this app ever again. Ever.,
one of the best app if you want yourself to stick to a schedule. put icon of this app on homescreen of your phone so you dont mis your focus and other things will be taken care by app,
I've been using Todoist since 2016 for personal and work projects. I simply love it. Paid my premium subscription yesterday. Couldn't be happier!,
The only to-do app that I need! Just right features with no nonsense. Helps me stay on top of my work and personal life both! Much appreciated!,
"Being able to declutter my mind by putting the tasks I need to do on it, has been helping me sleep better already, since I don't have to keep thinking on all the things I have to do the next day or week.",
"This app is exactly what I was looking for , I have organize my projects and personal life with an eagles view and I don't have to worry about forgetting anything.",
Been using this app maybe for 8 years now and daily for my business ... couldnt ask for any better. Helpsbme tremendously Improve my business This is my first review on play store and it goes to this app because really deserves a bit of my time .,
"Not easy to use at all, especially the reminders. Also, can't put to-dos in calendar.",
I have this on my phone and desktop so it's really straight forward to add and keep track of tasks and set reminders whilst on the go would definitely recommend,
Easy to use and tracks at exactly the right level for me. Premium is definitely worth it.,
"Amongst all free todo apps I've tried, this one is the most simple yet feature rich one. I wish I could have 2 accounts on the app.",
I have been using todoist for years for my personal life. It is my personal assistant!! Juggling all the commitments in life is alot easier using todoist.,
"Not intuitive. I swear items have disappeared. If you want to see what you have already done, you have to pay for premium. No thanks. Back to using Keep.",
"After the new update, adding a task to a section in a project doesn't work. It just doesn't do anything. Samsung Galaxy A52",
Adored this app until they intentionally broke the recurring hourly on completion. Now I have to waste a lot of time looking for another app.,
Excellent app for planning both home and work life. Integration with Alexa and calendars very good and I use this across multiple devices,
I love the app. It has saved me countless hours. It has given me insight into my productivity and has MEASURABLY improved my life.,
Honestly i really love it! Easy and fun to use! I have tried a few to do list apps and this is by far my favorite! And im a picky person.,
"Everything cool and it would be better if we could be able to set deadlines and have more freedom with the date setting (like ""every mon, tue and friday for three months at 5pm"")",
I love the fact that I can create a list of items to do and check them off as I go right here in this app. The notifications are like my own personal secretary. It has helped me tremendously with productivity.,
This app is where I have outsources my brain. My entire life runs on this app and it's so smooth compared to many others. I love how seamless the experience feels between devices,
"can be 5 star but if you add an option to repete tasks and it contains some additional options ( how many times it will repete , 3 day a week , on mondays , ets ) it will be more professional thanks in advance ..",
I've always struggle with planning until this app came into my hands. The integration with G Calendar and the ability to create subtasks makes it easy to mannage your activities.,
I been using this with the getting things done process and it has been a huge win for being productive! It isn't perfect but works better then anything else I have tried to use.,
Todoist is a great app and has grear integration between the mobile app and my gmail account in my browser. it's simple and easy to use. highly recommended,
This app is truly awesome. Best to-do list app I've ever used. I have no problem paying for the premium version. Has definitely added value to my life,
"I am a new user and mostly use the widget, but neither can I tick the DONE tasks nor am I able to create new tasks from the widget. Infact none of the buttons work on the widget.",
Upgraded on Wear OS but now does not open; Edit: the app has been further updated and has fixed the bug described above so increased the rating; Edit 2: Reduced the rating as Wear OS app really slow,
Hi Team Any chance there's a web version I can use in my PC? I'm loving the app so much that it would be handy to have it on my PC to view and sync at all times!,
"Simple, Clear and very helpful. I'm a Graphic Designer and I mostly use the app for managing project tasks and it works very well for me.",
"The app is good, but notification emails are so annoying and can't be stopped. Please fix it.",
Best Experience of recording the to do list and planning my week ahead.. I like the aspect where you can view 7 days tasks together.. Good work guys.. Really appreciate it.,
I'm someone that needs a little bit of assistance to make sure I stay organised and on remain on track. Todoist does the job perfectly.,
"5 star is not enough for review this app! Such a great app of productivity series! I use this app and I find some unique feature than any other to do list app! Afterall, It is a great app for productive to do list.",
I have been using Google tasks for a couple years - switched to Todoist a week ago and I love the change. Grouping by project is a game changer.,
"Great app, does everything it says it would, I would recommend to others who want to follow a planned routine to maximize productivity.",
most organized to do list. and it's so so nice when the free version has so many useful features! thank you!!!,
Very cumbersome to use. Can't even understand how to add repeated Reminders. I happy with ticktick. No switch required.,
"after I updated my android to the new system, I havent been able to tick off one singular task. I have to select multiple. what is the fix for this???",
"Too much brilliance,marvelous and outstanding,as an app developer I strongly recommend,kindly give project limit exceeds atleast ten. Add some alarm notification if todo planned activity occurred.",
Very useful to keep me motivated and helps my time management skills. Wish some features weren't only for premium members like adding comments to tasks.,
Still learning the ropes. But loving being more productive and planning ahead. Great app. And on different platforms. Thanks,
"Thanks for creating this app. It's really good but I hope you can add a ""PLAN MY DAY"" feature where we can easily schedule our today's tasks within the day and a summary monthly view with color tags so we know whicb project are on that particular day. Thanks and God bless",
"Need to make an account, and spammed with emails after signing up. I wanted a to-do list app not a way to sell my data.",
They send email spam without unsubscribe links. Update: You don't consider an email about pricing a marketing mail? That's an Olympic level of mental gymnastics.,
awesome app. I am so much more productive! love it. has changed my day greatly. if you feel overwhelmed and do not know how to start this is perfect.,
"This is a best app made easy. most of the time I accomplish my days tasks because of the email reminders. End now that I write things down i do more, this is must have. Thank team Todoist",
"5 mins in and im already having a bug. Created a new project and clicking on it doesn't do anything, way to go as a first impression.",
I really enjoy this app I use it everyday it is super easy to use and has so many options from board colours to different years.,
I love how easy and intuitive this is to use while being so detailed and thoughtful. I really like the way this app is organized and this will really help with my ADHD,
I am a raw beginner but looking forward to finding out the finer points. Several videos posted online have given me an insight towards what is possible.,
"Free version missing key functions and paid version is VERY expensive now. Unfortunately there are now better, more inexpensive options.",
Please make it possible to quickly switch from the widget to the app. One star to attract attention. Will make it 5 as soon as widgetToAppButton appears.,
I'm using the premium version a few days now. I'm not getting any notifications for my reminders. I checked the menu and everything is fine. Is there something you can do to help?,
The best app for managing your tasks. The Karma motivtes me to do my tasks on a regular basis. Highly recommended!,
I haven't explored everything but what i have i love it. Easy but not plain. I'll give a more detailed once i dig into it's entirety.,
I've been using it for several years now. It's the best. My wife and I are using shared shopping lists with an app widget. Synching is perfect.,
"Its been a year since i last had this app and i must say it is already a majorly huge improvement than what freemium was before. 3 stars since its day one still, but i have high hopes that this will end up with another star or two. Thank you!!!",
Everything is premium. lots of useful things are premium and you actually have to buy them. everything except that is good.,
Never been able to get organized. Todoist is the first system to ever work for me. I'm new to it but it's already become such a part of daily life I think it'll be a real game-changer for me!,
No support for Arabic language from next version... It's gonna be the only to do list with no support for Arabic!! Time to look for a new to do list app.,
"Very useful app for this who can't organize day and has a mess in the plans. Tried for free and like it, now going to premium for more functions. Hope it will help everyone üéØ",
Really good free option. Works well for me and my girlfriend (Apple user) to be able to make and share a variety of lists and information.,
"So far, it's been nice to keep track of projects and things I need to do. I like the sub tasks option and this app is amazing. Thank you developers.",
"Simple design, clean UI, useful for use as GTD and also very powerful when using its filters. The best IMHO.",
Best app for managing tasks. I live by GTD and Todoist is the perfect tool for this. And it's always improving. Love it!,
I've relied on this app for years. For some reason now I can no longer find completed tasks when I search for them. When did this change?,
Now it is working (from my previous review). The integration with smartphone and desktop is really good.,
I can't believe I forgot to rate this app. I absolutely LOVE it. I pair it with Alexa to keep track of the things I need to do. It helps at home and at work. I cant think of anything this app is lacking.,
Very handy. as i have this horrible addiction to look at my phone I thought I might as well use it to improve my productivity. ;-) its smooth.,
"Have been using the premium version for a couple of years now and its the best for organisation by far. Simple, does what you need it to do!",
I've heard such good things and I was so excited to try this app... but it just keeps crashing. My phone tells me it has a bug. Now I'm just disappointed,
I've set up several reminders but none of them went off at the time I had them set for! Figured it out. I have to pay so I'll just find another app.,
Loves it!I will recommend this to other's. I also loved when it stays on my phone screen of the list.I can see it.Good job.I enjpy seeing it right there.I not evrn need to open the app to see my list.I had the theme black.,
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know.",
"Used to be 5 stars, but now you need pro version for reminders? Isn't that a basic feature of a decent to-do list app. I'm changing it to one star.",
Thanks for bringing back the 'open app' button on the widget. Now just let us decide if new tasks should be inserted on top or at the bottom of the list please.,
"It's revolutionised the way I work as a medical student. Makes going from one task to another effortless, allows me to stick to breaks, etc",
This app is awesome for keeping To-Do lists and collabotaing with others. I have the pro version and I find it to be well worth the money.,
"""reminders are a paid feature"" That's one of the most basic feature of a to do app!! Why even bother to have a free version? THIS IS STRICTLY A PAID APP.",
"Super simple to use. Simpler than Asana, plus with both labels and projects, it allows great ways to cross reference. I'm using it to implement GTD with great success",
This app works well and had some adv features. I am only interested in a basic app. It does all I ask very well.,
"it's good, but I can't find list of completed tasks, they disappear from everywhere after completion, is it possible to see them in the app?",
"I have barely began using this app (less than 15 minutes) and I am already in love with the app. The Terms you have to agree to alone are just so assuring and satisfying. Kudos developers, kudos!",
Best todo list app I've ever used. I've been a happy premium customer for over 2 years now. It's well worth the $4/month.,
"Much more polished than Google Tasks. For example you can search for a task, which last time I tried want possible in Google Tasks.",
"This saved me as I journeyed into my career of teaching. So much to do and so little time, this app kept me organised in my new chaotic life!",
Buggy. Also I'm looking for a list with specific alarms and alert to keep me on task daily. Can only get that feature if you pay for it,
"I love it SO much! It's skyrocketed my productivity level & my focus, it's easy to use, & the features in premium are so worth it- thank you to the Todoist Team!!",
"this has completely changed the way I work and get things done at home. makes it easier to get everything done, has just enough of a game element and is easy to use",
"Love this app, just one thing what I don't like is that I can't turn on notifications somehow, so I do have to visit the app every time to see what plans are there written",
"I was already organized, but now it's even better. The connection to drive Gmail and android is the key and why I chose todoist over Omni focus.",
"A piece of garbage considering the hype around it. Without paying monthly or yearly, basic one DOES NOTHING SPECIAL! $5/month to add reminder !!! I get it from Google for free. THIS APP IS GARBAGE!",
I use it constantly to remind me to get things done. I love that I can set times and it will give me notifications. It's the best app I've got!,
"The most basic feature of setting a reminder is behind pay wall. Instant red flag, Uninstalled. I'm not paying a penny for poor design like this.",
"I think it's a really great app, it helps you with planning, it has proved helpful to me as I always need to plan prior to something I do...",
helps me keep track of things I need to do throughout the day. It's very helpful when reminding me what I haven't done the next day as well. Overall this app is great for keeping track of things you need to do.,
You download the app and then have to upgrade and pay for something and you dont even know what it is? No free trail or notification before downloading.,
"useful to remember your tasks. User friendly. many functionalities such as priorities, tags, labels, comments etc.. keeps you motivated with the karma points system",
this app is missing subtasks and obviously no prioritizing subtasks. when subtasks are added if they ever are please make with all the primary task options and a next action option.,
This app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has. The only negative I would say is that I would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free,
"Easy to use, a simple to do list. Next step is to test Slack integration with my team. Will update after results.",
"Fantastic! Really appreciate the new sort functionalities. Excellent app, continuous improvements make app be in the top 1% of Productivity category. Thank you!",
"Great app. Keeps me organized. Can't get it to integrate with my Google calendar yet, but that's not a deal breaker for me.",
Love the app cause it is available on pc too. I have a reauest to the team. Please add an option that a task we add comes everyday.(same task every day) please!!!,
"I use Todoist for uni and personal projects, and it is the best to-do list ever! Kudos to the team who worked on this amazing app! ü§ó",
Overrated and not helpful at all especially for people with ADHD. It's really complicated to get by aswell if you do not pay for premium.,
Really easy to use...I can even check my list while on the computer... Really convenient and has helped me get a lot of things done!,
I can complete tasks without being pressured and even just jotting them down and never looking at them again can still remind me that I have to do that task.,
The best task list app on the play store.. Whenever I feel dizzy...I complete my tasks for the sake of this app atleast ... A big thanks goes to its creators...Love you all !!!,
How can i set a task to repeat daily or weekly ?? Thank you for your backup. I have another question? Is there any settings to do to see today tasks in their own project? Like a tittle and then related tasks,
Dear developer Please add 2 more features: 1. Alarm reminder 2. Duration of task and What if I want any task to be recurring but every Sunday off for that particular task only?,
very useful app. would greatly appreciate more flexible karma goal planning like finish 5 tasks a day with priority 2. ie goal planning using queries. is that available perhaps in paid version??,
"it uses an algorithm that understands your timing based on your Task. all you need to do is just write the task like "" I want to book my tickets tomorrow at 9:30"". no need to set the time nothing.",
I am a new user and have only used the app in a minimal way to date. So far I am encouraged to make more use of it to manage my tasks and appointments.,
"Great app. Synchs immediately. Intuitive. Love this app. I've tried a few to do apps, and this one is the best",
Solid daily to-do app. Especially when having the widget on your main screen to tick things off as you go about your day.,
"Really helping my mental health and self esteem journey by making my day more manageable, SMART goals are easily documented and tracked over long term as well through the projects tool.",
Awesome app. A request to the devs: I wish there was some way o take notes in this app that is linked with a task. So it will be better for future reminders.,
"I love this app so much and I use it everyday. Even on the free tier, there's enough features to make this one of the best to do apps out there.",
Love this app. If you use it it helps a lot,
"Very good app, it keeps reminding me every week to do my weekly review, and that's what I do, can't wait to actually start using it properly tho üòÖ",
Easy to use and full featured. Connects to Google Calendar and elsewhere. Project structure along with Categories and Keywords allow Flexible use. Filters allow you to Zero In on the Key Tasks and Actions to Be Aware of NOW and Here too.,
I use this to organize my study time at home and helps a lot! it's not very hard to use imo. highly recommend:),
so reminder is a premium feature. then just put a price on the app. this feel like a scam. i looked for a simple FREE application here. wasting my time.,
"This is a great app. I installed it two months ago, and I use it everyday. It keeps me awake to all my appointments, and helps me to organize everything. I recommend it to everyone.",
It's just my forth day using Todoist and I'm absolutely loving it! So simple to use plus it's really motivating. Highly recommended! üòä,
Excellent app. Tried everything and this is the best all around productivity app out there. Well worth the premium upgrade.,
"This really helps keep track of my to do items every day. I manage to the day, and not the project, and it really helps.",
"Brilliant application for to do list, notification and mail feature keeps me updated each day help me out to do my work more consistent manner. Thanks devs for this",
Would give it at least 4 stars but I can't. I uninstalled it a long time ago and it still sending me notifications? Idk if it's a glitch but it's annoying.,
"Very good app, but It would be nice if you add lasting tasks, for an example a task that starts at 14:00 and finishes at 15:00 I hope you understood me :P",
"Great organizer, however, too many features require you to have a paid membership, while similar apps don't require any membership fees.",
"Pretty good for keeping to do list - nice interface. Takes some workarounds to make it work for Getting Things Done, but nice. Thanks",
"I'm totally dependent on this app, use it everyday. I wish it was more seamless to move multiple items to the next day, but otherwise great",
The best mobile app I have ever use for everyday tasks. You can customize everything by your own and you needn't pay for it! Incredible!,
I didn't think I would need a to-do app. But it's just nicer to offload reminders. And setting tasks to stop myself from procrastinating.,
"I wanted remainder features and therefore installed it , but unfortunately I didn't get . I was totall disappointed. The screenshot showed had remainder. Please try doing them.",
"The feature of able to detect time, label, & projects on what i typed when editing tasks within inbox is now being removed (auto-detection still available on adding new tasks though) please consider to put it back",
Reminders are a premium feature? No thanks. Id pay a one time fee but subscription for what other apps do for free? No thank you.,
I like the app. But I don't like that they want you to pay for reminder alarms. I would give it more stars if that option was free.,
Best to do list app out there. I have been using it for 3 years already and achieved great productivity with it. Everything is great so far.,
This app is sooooo good for productivity. Love all the features you can use for creating to-do lists. Highly recommend. :),
"It took me a little bit to get started, but it us easy ti move items yo next day as needed. The email reminder is helpful as well.",
It's exactly what it needs to be. A good app for those with ADHD.,
"This app is making me manage better! I love it, specially when I use it on different platforms and web. I definitely suggest it to my friends.",
Crazy fun totally functional to-do-list. Good reminders for anything you need to be reminded of. Sinks with your Google account.,
"Not sure why a todo list app needs total permissions to see everything in my Google account... so no thanks, looking elsewhere. Surveillance capitalism is not inevitable, control yourselves not others!",
"I have only been using this app across all my devices for a few days, and it's the best app I have in my life. It's perfect for business and keeping on top of things!! Highly recommend üíØ",
"Useless app, I can't use the reminder. I need to pay to use thr reminder. I hope the reminder, can also available in free version.",
amazing. helpful. i use it for work and personal. it helps me sleep better because my tasks are so organized now!,
"Easy to use for the most part. The only ""issue""i sometimes have is the number of clicks required to access some actions",
"Well, it's a To Do List maker and that's exactly what it does. Love the capability of having a dark theme though!!",
"love it, takes some time to get it set up how you like but its kinda life changing when used in conjunction with GTD. Carl pullein youtube vids are great tutorials",
I love the feeling of ticking off things I've purposes to do and actually accomplished at the end of the day and todoist aids in that great sense of accomplishment. Super grateful,
"Minimalistic, clear design. Very convenient, no bugs, no lags.",
GREAT EXPERIENCE! Note for Devs: Please add true Dark Mode (AMOLED) on both the App and Widget. Options of Font Size for the Widgets would be a great bonus as well! Thank you!,
"When i type some words in the task they just disappear (eg sun) Doesnt allow me to rearrange the tasks under the project, this is a basic feature.",
"Starting last week, the app no longer work on my phone. Even after I uninstalled and reinstalled several times.",
"Still learning how to better use it, but certainly one of the best apps to implement Getting Things Done and free your mind from microtask clogs.",
I use this across platforms and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good and useful to do list app that they can use on any device,
"Fantastic productivity app. I am very suprise how it had change my habit, i am able to do more work on time because of this app. love it..",
Cant unsubscribe from mailing list despite deleting the app. Its very underhanded and for that i will forever trash your app. Give me an option to unsubscribe!!!,
Just amazing. I just want an option to set the list in order that i prefer even if I set them by !!1 !!2 !!3 or !!4.,
"Love the app. Is there a way to remove or reduce the animation (transitions, etc)? I'm autistic and they bother me a bit, I'm always looking for way to reduce cognitive load. Thanks.",
"I really like the app but I'd like it even better, if i could see all the things i've marked as ""Done"" aswell, so i can see how much I've done this day, or so",
Before I could even use the app It demanded my email and Google log in. It's a check list. I'll stick with a notepad that won't steal my data thanks.,
The thing I love the most about this platform is that you can also access your tasks in your computer. Very useful feature for when I can't access my cellphone.,
All good but completed tasks disappear when you tich them and there's no way to find them and monitor completed tasks.,
"It's a free todo app that does not offer a Reminder feature unless one pays for the ""PRO"" version. Deleting it immediately.",
"I cant live without this app, or so until and helps me organise what I need to do so well, its interface and wigets are great too.",
Everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it. A simple push notification and you want me to pay for it.,
Was extremely dossapointed when I had to give up Wunderlist and could not find a good replacement until Todoist! Literally me new favourite organizing list app!,
Best to do list I have come across so far. The way the app grasps keywords especially for setting dates is really cool.,
"That's the best todo list I've tried so far, and it 's surprsingly compatible with ""Getting Things Done"" system by David Allen. Using this is a pleasure .",
Its a great app. I am so organized now.its easy to use. It sends you a email every day telling you what you have planned,
Uninstalled immediately. It said i already had an account. I went through the entire reset process and still couldn't sign in. Waste of time,
"This app is awesome. I have a sugestion, in the app can't see the projects order by folder, will be good can see by folder",
Great app...todoist is a very easy to use and very easy to customize and set up. Highly recommend!,
It has a really useful ability to add sub-tasks to other sub-tasks. Great to use for ordering tasks.,
"Latest update has changed how to set a date and time, and it's not great. Prefer the old version.",
"Great to-do app that does everything you want, also syncs perfectly with planner for Elementary OS.",
"Haven't had it for very long, so I haven't gotten the hang of the scheduling yet. I do like being able to make projects. Nice feature.",
I love this app. If i could add contacts through sharing the app via whatsapp that would make it great... cause i dont have all my friends emails.,
Really good a combination of features that I've looked for in other apps but never found. Really well designed and very intuative to use,
"The app looks really good and it has widgets, but why can't the widgets automatically switch between light and dark mode?",
"Easily the bsst to-do list in the market. Don't be intimidated by the price, which, is pretty cheap. It is worth every single penny.",
very simple design that makes adding a task complex! also most useful features are premium.,
Has its own strengths. Not as easy and intuitive as Trello or Wrike but can handle Subtasking well.,
Todoist is an Outstanding Piece of Code! I highly recommend it!!! It dramatically reduces your stress in life if you use it vigorously!,
"Okay for making lists for tasks due same day, but not much better than notepad.. Very difficult interfacewhen creating long term goals ie not due same day",
"Very useful, but when Google keep is there as another option there isn't much competition , with keep so easily syncing to reminders in wear OS",
Latest update with lower screen controls great and hope others take this lead. Giant phones shouldn't need giant hands.,
Great app with an awesome widget! Love the projects section and the different lists you can make. Helps me get stuff done!,
Excellent app except the large widget. Is there an option to change the text size of the widget and make it a bit compact ?,
"great app, especially because of the syncing between devices! Helped me get my things back in order - seriously.",
Perfect interface that is easy to use. Just enough features for me.,
"Ive been using this for a long time and it has been a joy. However, after a recent update, the widgets stopped working. Able to help?",
Amazing app l. Helps me with everything. Good job paid features. Very helpful widget and little to no distractions.,
It was really nice it really makes me so productive during school and it usually be my reminder if I forgot to make my assignment or the thing that I have to do.,
Love this app. Makes life somewhat easier....so much to do so little time but nice to have someone or something helping you all the way.,
"Best app when it comes to organizing and planning your tasks, great UI , easily syncable across devices",
Fix this asap If we add task widgets on home screen then ..if the task is written long then it gets hide with the dotted lines .... Fix this so that whole statment shall be visible,
I have found this tool to be really amazingly useful for me. It is enabling me to get more done and also keep track of a vast variety of tasks in my work and personal life.,
"I want see my finished task in widget but I can't .I want also add some task that I want to do all days during week, but I have to add this same task every day please add this function thanks for your perfect app",
"I would rate it 4 or 5 star.. but it's just that the main features aren't free... Otherwise you can go for it.. It's an ""OKAY"" app.",
"Very good todo list program. Use it for home, work, and school tasks. Good use of repeating tasks as well",
"This definitely is one of the best app in the market. Although, it would be better if I could sync my other calendars with this app.",
"I've been organizing my life with this for years. I wish I could share lists with people who don't have Todoist, but otherwise super!",
The easy way to keep your schedule flowing and remain on time in a messy world,
a very focused goal-attainment app. it made me think about how my goals were stated and kept me honest about my work.,
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!",
These guys take theirs todo list management very seriously. But they also made it easy to use. Great job! And the free tier does all I need :),
"does exactly what you would want a to.do manager to.do. easy to join, doesnt need huge permissions or try to tie you into other apps. very happy",
I'm an unmotivated highschooler worried about scraping together a graduation: this app has helped me become more productive. It's an excellent tool ü§ô,
"Please add support to add a task at any position (something like ""add task below/above"" )this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version",
Have to pay $4/mo if you want the reminders to work. I have ADD. The reminders are the #1 thing I need in a to-do list!,
Hi this is the greatest app ever I'm using for completing task. Can you try to put Voice recorder option as well? If possible.,
I cannot re-edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it. I want to edit it from the text box not from the calender.,
"It's pretty much my one stop shop for all my schedules, reminders and todos. With Google calender sync and IFTTT I have all my GTDs here, including timely reminders to bring an umbrella to work daily if it's raining using IFTTT.",
I love the new design! And the drag-from-the-button gesture is so great! Thanks so much for one of my favorite apps ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üôåüèº,
Straight forward platform. We're all on our devices all the time anyway so might as well be productive and this is a great app to do so.,
Uninstalled. This app has 7 user behavior and personal data trackers including a few sending data to Facebook. Todoist obv has no concern for privacy or protecting users.,
Todoist helps me keep organised and keep track of various things I need to get done. It's the best app I found for doing this.,
"It is a good task manager but the font size is too small, especially in the browser.",
"It is very very easy use and after spending hours longing a to do list app , i can say this is the best app i have ever used. Download it and install it i promise you will not regret it",
"""Add Task"" button in project doesn't work unless üëâüëâüëâ With new update ,I cannot create task under any project (add task doesn't work when project is opened). This can only be achieved by 1Ô∏è‚É£ creating the task in the main dashboard and then moving it to other project which is a hassle. Or another way to directly create a task is 2Ô∏è‚É£ to open app in split screen and then open that project , then only the add task works. Otherwise it doesn't work in full screen",
"Apps like these who include ""on time reminders"" in premium are red flags for me. At least let users get habituated in your app for a week or so & then let them get premium. Why would you want to force people to get premium as soon as they download your app?",
"The tasks do not coninue to the next day, alternate day, week, alternate week etc. I am unintalling it for that reason. also removing it from my watch",
I've tried several different to-do apps and this is the one I've found that does all I need it to do. I've stayed with it and for me that's saying something. the Karma stuff is a bit silly though.,
"great app with 1 recommendation, would like to see this app also include a due date. perhaps its already there but cant see it in the widget versiin, thx,!",
Really useful for tasks but I am unsure how to repeat the tasks and feel like manually typing every day is a bit much.,
Bad experience. The support is the worst ever. And no thought has been put except for the visual ui. The ux is bad.,
"This is my favorite to do list app. I literally use it everyday. Its great, works perfectly, and makes my life so much easier.",
I like it I can plan ahead in advance for things,
This app had helped me a lot in completing my exam preparation schedule!!! I would recommend this app to use..it is very helpful!!!,
"Best to do list app, great options to personalize your workflow and organization, helps me to increase productivity and task management, customer service agents are so so sweet and kind.",
"I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it.",
"Perfect application !! It helps manage all tasks and connect to google agenda, even the free one is full of options ! I REALLY LOVE ITT!!!",
useful free features make this my go to task tracker for personal todos. not powerful enough for professional project management.,
"really really good app - just what I needed. it does have a few little quirks I had to wrap my head around, but overal very good",
"Lovely app for managing tasks and projects, with incredible utilities. The fact that it has a web-app thing for my old tablet is awesome",
"This app provides the common function of to do list. in addition, it organises tasks similar to the way JIRA does, which I am familiar with through work.",
Can't make multiple tasks of the same type for different dates. Have to do them individually which is a waste of time.,
"Just an idea, can it be possible if it contains an app block too like if we select some specific apps we wont be able to access them until we complete our to do list",
"Never had any other app get my things together in very short amount of time. For starters, I recommend using Eisenhower's matrix technique with priorities.",
it's great for reminders and for work . great app,
Love using this but I just wish I could customize the widget more like the opacity and such to make it fit my phone's theme more (I have the premium version),
"This is the best task management app I ever used! It's simple yet complete, it is very aestheticly pleasing. Recomend 100%",
To focus on studying with this app is a brilliant idea cause it reminds you to do homework even more strictly than your teachers. A must-have app,
used todoist for several years. I hate long to do lists and it helps me view the right stuff on the right day so I'm not overwhelmed,
"Great app! It has a couple things I find annoying, that most people probably wouldn't. The developer is quick to respond to any questions I've ever had.",
"I love how easy it is to add items, and that they sync across platforms and devices Also, that I can add them to /through Alexa",
"I've tried dozens of task and habit management apps, and this is the only one I've been able to stick with.",
"Very very useful indeed to keep track of all my project tasks, both business and personal.",
Really helped me to level up my organizing and productivity! I wouldn't need all the premium features really tho.,
simple and does exactly what i need it to without getting in the way. really useful for keeping on top of everything!,
"Great, simple app for managing daily tasks. Keeps your tasks in sync on all devices.",
I rely on it heavily for organizing and remebering tasks. Syncs seemlesly between all of my devices.,
Great app for managing your todo lists. Very intuitive and easy to use.,
"Great, Amazing. If keywords for Due dates, Filters were pickup list, it may easier.",
You can't set up a reoccurring routine and setting an alarm is behind $3 pay wall. Don't waste your time.,
Widget is not working. Will show up but then it freezes and you can't do much with it only remove it.,
Great app! Nice and clean UI. Very useful for monitoring daily tasks. Works awesome for some group projects!,
"If you want a quick and easy to-do list that synchs across platforms, this is for you.",
"easy to use, simple layout. set tasks get reminders tick them off. perfect",
My time management has really improved since using Todoist. I get through tasks strategically through the day and even have some spare time for me üòÅ,
Seem very friendly app. The only thing I dislike you need to upgrade to pro for reminder/alarm feature.,
"Very helpful, I really felt productive and organized. Easy to use and clean UI and designüòäüòä",
"Really like the app, and developers are very responsive to suggestions. Does everything I want a task app to do.",
Very fluid and multifunctional. A bit hard to understand at first. Serves its purpose and makes you feel good about it.,
Personally thought this had reminders I could use but cannot without buying features. Considering I have severe ADHD I wouldn't even remember to pay for premiums.,
Im loving this app! Its really helping me get organized! Im really going to need it when i start school this fall!,
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help,
Probably the best piece of software I've ever owned. Both in terms of ui / design and in actual day-to-day usefulness.,
"It is useless if you do not buy premium features. No attachments and comments, no labels, nothing. Piece of trash.",
I love this app. Its such a great way to stay organized and on schedule. I upgraded to the paod version and am loving it :),
The entire point of downloading this was to get reminders. However to get reminders you have to upgrade to premium. Which is stupid.,
there is an immediate problem: to review any of ypur completed task you need to buy a pro version. Then it is not worth to use free version at all,
so easy to use. I wish I could bring back categories I wasn't using before. easy to access on all my devices. absolutely love it,
This app has introduced me to ways to organising I didn't know exsisted. So many options! Exactly what I was looking for and more.,
"Best task list I've come across. Very functional, and I use for work and personal. Best of the bunch",
Can you please add an option to see the caledar (monthly) in order to quickly view the total tasks for the month.,
"I got premium subscription just because hiw convenient this app is! And the price is very reasonable as well- thanks developers, for giving me this opportunity <3",
I was using a different app. for my grocery list. Now I just tell Alexa to add items to my Todoist! So easy!,
"I do not understand why they do not implement start dates, otherwise it is a very good app. The reason for not doing this is not adequate in my opinion. I want to not be able to see some tasks every day and I can accept the risk from being hidden.",
"Great app, nice intuitive design makes it very low friction to use (crucial for a decent todo app), and the natural language input is fantastic",
"Super polished, quick to learn and useful app Using it to manage everything (home and work). Highly recommended.",
"This was a solid replacement for wunderlist, but it isn't simply a to do list. It's more of productive tasks",
"The app should return to the previous version when all sub-tasks could be displayed directly on the ""today"" view (right now this is only possible on a project view)",
"I wish reminders weren't just a premium feature, they should be a basic feature. Everything else is fine.",
Updated review: the developer helped me out in an email exchange so i can put my review back to 5 stars. Haven't been able to find a better to do app than this one.,
I renewed premium upgrade. You now have my money and I don't have access to my created projects! This is one angry customer!,
"I love this app. I may not use all the features but there are some great features that I use everyday, I really think this app is worth a shot for anyone.",
"Most often used app daily! The most reliable, most used app on my phone, laptop and desktop.",
Keeps my entire life organized! I love that I can access the app on my phone and desktop. Definitely recommend!,
"The whole point of such an app is reminders, they are paid features, that's okay. It's very expensive.",
"Please, make an option to use the old style widget. Unfortunartely letters became too small for 4x6 home screen grid.",
Excellent update. Thanks Todoist team. I would suggest customizing the font size on the widget as it seems small.,
"I do not appreciate the automatically added tasks. Also, I cannot save a task unless I am in the middle of editing thd tags which is not helpful",
Filters stopped working after the latest update. Logging out and logging in back fixed the issue.,
I love this app with all my heart :) it is absolutely perfect! Thank you for creating it! Stunning work!!,
"The App was really amazing but it keeps shutting down everytime I open it, I have tried to re-install but was still unsuccessful",
Best To Do(L)ist app I've found yet. Customer support is quick. The latest UI is ü•µü•µ Appreciate the free features! Kudos to the Team.,
I wish i could see completed task in my list just tick or cut off. I don't like the fact that it disappears to completed section,
"A ""free"" app that charges for notifications. Basically useless if you're unwilling to pay.",
"works for my girl and I. she's a planner and I'm a doer, so it saves us the long beaurocratic meetings about what needs done and instead of TALKING about tasks needing completed, I just DO it, which is more my style.",
"Capturing the gold. So good to have a means of capturing those fleeting thoughts throughout the day, which sometimes lead to gold.",
"used to be my favorite apps, but sync bugs drove me crazy too many times, auto replace link with title made me mad, cancelled subscription & uninstalled",
I've been researching To-Do List apps for myself and clients for years... this is the absolute best!,
"I've tried a lot of organisation apps and this is my favourite, just really simple, easy to use and effective.",
"I am a busy person with lots of different responsibilities: three jobs (including a business co-owned with my wife), three kids, church, and a doctorate program. Todoist just helps me find some order and not go insane.",
"Incredible. Takes some up front effort to learn, but I now organize my entire life with this tool. Seriously.",
I love it. it's amazingly helping me organising all my tasks and life. Moreover it is make me becoming more focused and reliable,
This app helps me plan my important tasks and keeps me reminded when needed but the only thing is that there is a problem with setting manual alarms for certain scheduled tasks,
"Love it, used to use Asana, Toodledo, Trello, DGT GTD but this app does it all more easily, quickly and cleanly. It basically organises by life now!",
I find Todoist so easy to use. It is so straightforward and useful. the application is very effective and well laid out. I'm so glad that I have it.,
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved.",
"It's really good. I dont want to have to pay for premium and I wish I could see the tasks I've completed, but at the same time it works really well for what I need it for.",
"In my opinion is one the best todo apps that I ever download on my phone If you ask me why I think so? Because for me, firstly, in todo apps only the incentive to tackle the task matters to me. That's one of them",
"A brilliant little to do manager! Check out the free version, then upgrade if you like it.",
"Extremely complicated to use. can't understand a thing. good app, but it needs a whole tutorial because it does so much",
Subscription model for to-do list? Are you a joke. Upd: figure out that most of the things are not hidden behind paywall change from 1/5 to 4/5. Still can't justify subscription model,
"Just uninstalled it It looks a great app, but one its fundamental features (reminder) was available only in premium mode.",
This used to be such a good app until they implemented a poorly thought out sort functionality that renders any 'living' list almost unusable.,
"Easy to use, and I love the way reminder pops up on the screen everyday and doesn't let you forget your duties!!",
Great app. simple but very effective. being able to use the app and the online version interchangeably is very useful,
"Great app, easy to use, you can schedule times and create priorities. I highly recommend.",
Tried as few. Todoist works the best for my needs. Love the Alexa and calendar integration.,
Very intuitive. The integration with google cal is the reason I came back.,
"Good overall user experience. It was unfortunate they removed metric tracking, however. Otherwise, great.",
"Intuitive UI, very easy to use (though difficult to master!).",
"The best to do list app ever, I already had used others, but no doubts this is the better, minimalist, simple and faster!",
I love it! Would just be great if it also had a function where you can see your tasks in Calender format,
just started. great so far. better for college than chipper if you make each class a different project.,
"tried a few of these apps, this one seems the most intuitive and feature rich. has a linux desktop client too, community maintained",
"i like it because i can just put down my todos as they arrive during the day and organize them in my calendar later. as suposed to seting it all in my calendar, wich takes time",
I'm a grad student with lots of tasks and like time. Todoist helps me to effectively manage the little time I have.,
"I've only been using it for a week, but so far it has been fantastic. I love the design, and more importantly I have been significantly more productive since I started using Todoist.",
Loved Todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me. Can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore.,
"It's a good assistant for daily life. But I don't like, that in there's a premium upgrade for money.",
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.,
My favorite app on Android! Great planning app. Fast bugfixes. Often new cool features appears.,
Great for More Productivity,
Okay I was happy until the sound on my in app tutorial did not work ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Of course with assistance this review can change.,
Have to have this for the edge bar panel which I purchased now I have to purchase this to use the specific features I wanted for the panel. Should be more upfront about these things people.,
"Love it. It's bit annoying that windows desktop application is not working but otherwise, it's awesome.",
"it technically does most of things you would want a list app "" to do "", but it seems to make them a bit tougher than other apps, or charges",
"Actual dogshit, spent a good portion of time setting up tasks for it to be all deleted the next day, nice job with the unintuitive menu",
"i like this app but the real reason I'm leaving 5 stars is in an attempt to stop it sending me notifications asking if i like it, even after leaving a 4 star review!",
My organisation skills have never been as good before I used this app. Its on all my devices. Makes sure every day of the year is not wasted,
"i love this app so much, helped me to finish my tasks on time way better! people who have a hard time trying to organise their tasks should try this app!!",
"One of the best apps I used in my whole life. Superb, thoughtful, subtle design makes you want to use it, and this is the key!",
Using the free version which is very good! may update to the pro version for the premium features! Definitely recommend,
Started using this app years ago in Chrome. Simple to use and does what you want with great flexibility.,
So helpful! Love the latest update that lets me indicate a completed task in one click. I depend on this app.,
"Its good for making lists, but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium, its just not for me",
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled.",
I been with out the Alex integration for a loong long time. I just got so use to using todoist. Now I'm moving to any.do and back with the Alex integration. Bye Todist!,
"i wish it supports smartwatch os as well where i can add, complete and modify the tasks thru my watch.",
The best to-do app,
"Optimal for work and private, a good Tool to stay on track while your 100 Tasks are burning your head. Write them down in todoist",
"Amazing app, after using tons of todo apps, I'm sticking to this one, checks all the boxes for me.",
"I couldn't figure out a way to sync with my Google Tasks, and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch.",
best app . and a small request that I want a reminder for my tasks because reminder is a premium version.. üôèüèø .. I like this app but more than other app ..üòäüëçüèª,
"excellent detail, organization and support in managing the details of life. also good link a d coordination with calendars.",
I've tried a lot of task tracking apps! Todoist have every essential function I love all combined in one app!,
"Difficult onboarding, no integration with google calendars, documentation is not very clear.",
It's a good app love the simplicity and layout of it but I don't think reminders should a Premium feature.,
Great app to keep you organised. Love the integration with Google calendar which ToDo doesn't have. Easy migration from Wunderlist.,
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...,
"Good, simple, clean, fast and easy to use, i prefer to choose a cold color like sky blue or turquoise because cold colors are more comfortable and calm",
"The widget stops working suddenly and doesn't show tasks. It says ""no tasks. Anything to add?""",
"Nice app, useful and easy to use. The free version has lots of options to serve the goal.",
"Had this app during college and it great to quickly add in things to do and also to have schedule projects, very clean and easy to use",
Near perfect app for boosting your productivity. I love it despite the developers breaking some features while updating.,
It is a nice app. But I don't like the fact that an alarm is a premium feature. But other than that everything works fine and great!,
"the only thing im not a fan of is the fact that there is a premium version, id prefer all to be free. however the free features are still supurb!",
free version has a lot of functionality but i do plan on paying after a few weeks of using it... just to see if i will use it consistently,
"I use premium! It has really all the features you want from task manager: GTD support, tags, hierarchy, Google calendar integration etc. Great product!",
Amazing...keeps on task and love the ease of using this ap. Love the Karma levels...makes motivated to get more done. I will reach Enlightened!,
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding me? This is an absolute deal breaker. I deleted after trying for 2 minutes.,
brilliant app and easy to use! have premium as a free trial but will definitely be paying to keep using it!,
"Love it. Has all the features i was looking for, yet still easy to use and available on all platforms.",
"love it, highly recommend it. it makes my life so much smoother, very easy to use and clean interface.",
Awesome app.. nice and simple to use. It really makes my to do tasks easy to manage and gets things done.,
"It's simple and to the point, but has the power to get complex when needed to. Loving it right now!!",
Good app but not very user friendly. Reminders behind a paywall and no way to repeat tasks :(,
very nice even in free version. I wish though that free version would have more unlocked features like comments and stuff.,
why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date? i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date.. can this be fixed???,
"Great, intuitive app. Helping me with time management and productivity.",
I like the regular updates. It shows that the Todoist team doesn't stop trying to make the app better.,
"great app! Really helped me feel happier and more productive! Makes it easy to plan out your day, week or even month!",
Easy To Use! I've been using it for the entirety of my college career. So easy to use and helpful to not have to carry around a giant calendar.,
It can not even start normally: Im clicking loflgin via email but nothing happened. I can not trust productivity app who fors not work from the beggining,
Excellent app but expensive - Charging an annuality for a service very similar of what Microsoft To-Do is offering for free now is something that needs to be considered.,
App sucks. Will not open. Kind of hard to cross off items from my to do list when I cannot access it.,
Very helpful tool for clearing my brain so I can focus on what is most pressing in my week with less mental fatigue.,
"So, when will you guys add a ""do when"" feature as well as a ""due date""? Like Things 3 has. Can you please consider it? Perhaps something similar?",
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review,
"I love this app. It's easy, intuitive and makes managing a schedule very easy",
"I would much appreciate a ""for later"" category for tasks that I have to do, but I haven't decided when to schedule them. like in the app anydo..",
"Simple, intuitive and yet quite useful. Oh, there is also no ads.",
"I would give todoist more than five stars; However, you keep ignoring users for enabling them to show completed tasks by default is just irresponsible, please add an option to always show completed tasks!",
The app keep crashing everytime I tried to create a label. But the app look interesting. Too bad üòî,
"Easy to use, would like to have desktop version that will sync with mobile.",
5 trial projects... There were much more and than they reduced the amount of project to increase sales. Also price is too high.,
Wished there's pomodoro timer function like ticktick or focus to-do. Hoping more features will be added on premium.,
Love this app was using a planner but I'm 100x more productive it's super simple but also very complex at the same time learn new things about it all the time 10/10,
Very useful and does the job. It's a shame some features are in the premium version.,
Missing the possibility to easily enter repetitive tasks without having to put the same task every day/week/month manually.,
"Has been the only app that had helped keep me organized, I have tried many, this one is very flexible.",
"Alexa shopping list integration is rubbish, items are added correctly but if an item is removed by another user they never leave the list.",
"Super useful, have been using the free version for a few weeks and feel like I have more control over my schedule.",
Thee absolute best task app I've ever used. Does everything you need and more omce setup with the GTD (Getting Things Done) principles.,
Almost perfect. Has some annoying quirks but it's the best task manager I have found so far.,
Make the program free without any pro features And then make a lot of people happy,
Great app. Helps me organized. Would love to see a better UI. Great app overall. I would keep it installed,
Excellent. Changed my appreciation of how much I can achieve in a day. Truly a game changing app. God bless you all mightily in Jesus name!,
Very nice format for constructing to-do lists. Have tried many and this is one of the better ones.,
"It's okay. Easy to use, just wish incould add a topic/note header toneach individual note.",
Best app for productivity boost. You have only what is needed in a really simple to use interface.,
"Highly recommended to focus attention in the many roles we play each day in our work, family, and personal lives. Suggestion for users: Add a task to check Todoist with #daily!",
Great. But it would be nice if the Android app icon had a count of tasks for today like the windows version.,
this app has been so amazing I paid the extra for premium and to be able to ha e scheduled push notifications. highly highly recommend!,
good app! I guess I miss some of the premium features in my free version but that's the order of things üòã,
This app is really useful. This app had helped me achieve more productivity. Loving it. Best for students.,
"Great app, ima kid. My family makes me watch videos about jesus each day and I do online school. There could be improvements but it truly is a great app.",
"Good, but you should allow to set default date to tomorow when creating new task. I schedule what todo usually the day before.",
"Wonderful app across all devices, not much is behind a paywall. Best free to do list with great integrations",
"super helpful, easy to utilize, smooth navigation. a great asset to any job.",
"great app, dinged 1 star for cost... but perhaps worth it as its the only wear os watch + mobile seamless integrated to-do/ task app there is.",
"The best. No matter what device I'm on, I can capture every idea, every thing to remember, and find what is important to do now.",
"Fantastic to-do-list app, just what I was looking for. It's so intuitive and does more than you need it to do",
"Love the fluidness and simplicity. Not too much, not too little... Just right. #goldilocksapproved",
"Quality, easy to use app for organizing tasks. Actually stuck with one for once!",
This app is plain and simply a great way to organize your day and very easy to use!! 10/10 recommend!! üëçüëç,
"great app ! i find the widget really useful and also the features , they have a stufent discount too which is awesome !",
"Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders.",
"Very easy to use, nice, simple interface. Nothing to extra",
No free trial. Notifications don't work. User interface is not user friendly.,
"easy to use, fast enough to set tasks but simple features are put in premum mode.",
"This app is useful and make my day productive , it should have voice listening so that we'll just have to tell our work and day nd time nd it will automatically schedule than it will become much easier nd convenient",
Not bad but keeps on deleting my recurring tasks... Which makes it unusable for me. I need something to remind me of it... Not to be adding them daily,
I paid for the subscription and now it doesnt show up under manage subscriptions for me to be able to end my subscription!!üò°,
"Very. Useful user friendly app to organise meetings, handy reminders to keep you focused.",
"It's helping me in my day to day activities, and facility to add subtasks and daily mail update makes it more valuable.",
"Good app, but lots of stuff was pay walled. Worked fine, but there might be a better option for free somewhere.",
The app is very good and literally helping me to stay productive and record my achievements and to stay aware of what I want to and but I have a concern is that I love to see the analytics of my work but in this app I am not getting in the more analytic like I want my monthly analytics just like there are day analytics for days and B okay so my basic concern is please add more analytic,
Does not let you use reminders in free version which should be a basic necessity for any productivity app!,
Why Free features like alarm are premium now ? Can't find widget and after leaving from the beta the install button disappeared. It's been 1 day I leave from beta testing,
It's a great app to chart your productivity.... Simple easy to use features make it all the more accessible.,
Great! Really intuitive interface and the natural language comments work like a charm :) very happy!,
So helpful. Keeps me organized and i don't forget anything and the tips and blogs are also really helpful. Love it.,
reliable and easy to use,
My favorite cross platform ToDo app by far. Alexa ToDo integration is great and sharing list with family members is the icing on the cake!,
Great app. The best thing is that you have both calender and to do list on one app. But can add Persian calender as well?,
"Free version has some limitations, but great productivity app so far--longest I've kept one going on the phone yet...!",
This is the absolute best todo app or website i have ever used! It has so many great features to organize tasks.,
The free version has a minimal functionality. There more advanced free apps on the PlayStore.,
"Todoist is really useful if you have a variety of tasks that you need to carry out, but don't want to write it down on pen and paper.",
This is the best app when it comes to to do...the free version is ok...,
"I need an account to store my data on your server? no local copy of my data? I can't work on my data offline? you want a monthly fee to retain my data? sorry, I need an app where I retain control of my data and you can't see that data. sell me an app, not a subscription service. uninstalling.",
I wish the time setting was easier. I always seem to duplicate the entries somehow.,
"Integration with Outlook, web browsers, and other tools really makes this the best activity tracker I have used.",
"I love this app! I use it to keep track of all my assignments for my college courses, as well as to keep up with maintaining my daily life.",
Highly recommend if you're like me and have trouble remembering things. Just waiting until i can afford premium!,
"Despite its bad UX on the web (e.g. it's a pain to add tasks to projects, Trello-like shortcuts would help), I like this app a lot!",
"that doese what it says, even free version gives plenty of options. can share a list among others and keep track thank you",
"This is amazing, it has been helping me to keep track of what I was supposed to do according to the plan that I designed. Thank you for making me be mor focused on my daily routine!",
Great app to organise your days in tasks by the hour! Very useful for busy people that wanna keep track of their productivity.,
Requires a sign up/login. How about an option for offline only. If an app requires a login it gets uninstalled immediately.,
"Easy to use, quite intuitive and not littered with advertisements. Win-win in my book.",
"I have tried a lot of todo apps. This app have everything i need, eccept making multiple list... Instead I have to make multiple projects.",
IFTTT integration makes this the best talk management application available. You can shorten the usual long Google commands to be short and sweet making among notes to TiDoist with your voice a breaze,
Its been 2+ years i am using Todoist. Thank you for this amazing app. It boosts my productivity and help me remember my tasks.,
Easy to use and great format with different levels of importance and goals to keep you on track,
"It's a great app for keeping me focused. I use it every day. I enjoy the karma levels, too. it makes everything feel more like a game.",
I like that you value privacy. So I'm disappointed that tasks within a project can't be broken down into more tasks. The comments feature doesn't seem to be enough of a supplement.,
"Recently moved from Wunderlist to Todoist. Very pleased with Todoist, especially the recurring task feature.",
if we could input estimate hours and actual hours for each task. and get summary on finished tasks each month. that will be perfect.,
Excellent. Very helpful with keeping track of things and is a perfect online checklist in my opinion,
"Not compatible with older Samsung tablet. What a crock, it's a to do app. Explain why Wunderlist can run but not this app...",
"I wish i could have started using this app earlier. This app is freaking so good. 10 star This app should editor choice app Genuine review Abhinav From india Just one request, premium version side little bit on pricey side. I can understand developer cost. If price is reduced, more people will start opting for premium side.",
its great to keep track of the things you have to do and it allow you to seperate things by projects.,
Incredible app. It's really helped me be a lot more focussed and productive with work and general life.,
"Using the app solely for daily tasks (creative work, exercise, cleaning). Works well enough for that.",
"Nice app, decent sublist setup, yet a little confusing, possibly me not understand doing his it works. Good app, just not ready to pay at this time.",
I use it every day to organise myself - couldn't do without it. The best organising app that I've found.,
Satisfied. But to me too little functions for free version. I'm not able to judge whether I'm ready to pay for full version,
"I love the flexibility of this app. There are a number of ways you can choose how you see and enter info, yet it is very easy to use.",
its really good for reminders of some important tasjs and for creating a daily to do list and tracking one's progress and dedication towards his/her progress.,
this does not work im a student and i forget things easily so yesterday i put task and add them for today and they werent there so after that i added a task today it aint show up so 0 stars.,
Their team won't add sorted by date ascending/Descending or created date of task since 7 months ago I created email their team about suggestion. Bec it's lack of focus without this.,
This is a very simple and powerful self-managemnet tool. I can add a new task at anywhere.,
Three stars because we can't set time to get a notification from a task. Please add that option even for the free users,
great for planning!. I was the caterer for a memorial reception. Todoist helped me to outline event and prep schedule to deliver food for the event. Love this tool!,
"It has helped me so much with school, and the google calender integration makes it even better. Thank you!",
Very intuitive interface. Love tracking tasks in it. Fun!,
Great app so far. It does some stuff that I'm not crazy about but it sorts thing well and keeps track of everything I need it to.,
Excellent app. Helps me to organize my day and remind all activities I have. Works good online and offline.,
The app's not opening. It always is having an error. Each and evrytime I'm installing it.Pls look into this problem.,
"Easy to use laid out to be user friendly, mixed bag on email reminders. All in all a helpful application",
"Does exactly what I want it to do, it's easy to use and a good reminder for my various taks and errands.",
An essential part of my life / brain. I especially rely on the widget to quickly add tasks.,
"Would loooooove the option to be able to add items that are not necessarily tasks, just notes I don't want to forget.",
"This is a great app.I use the free version, I know there are many features that I don't get to use due to that fact, but it does what I need for the most part.",
"Great organizational tool, really helps you define the steps and timetable for each of your goals.",
Easily the best task manager. And I've tried about 15 of them. Even works with Google assistant.,
Really like it. I can organize all of my tasks easily and across platform. Keep up the good work,
"Intuitive, easy, and motivating! Great to use on multiple devices",
I hate that marking a task as completed doesn't automatically mark the sub-tasks that were part of it as completed too.,
Riddled with bugs and the UI gets more and more unusable as time goes on.,
"I very rarely leave reviews, but this app has had a dramatic positive influence on my day to day productivity, I highly recommend it!",
I have tried many to do list apps. But this is the best. Just renewed my premium subscription,
It opens but won't let me add the to do tasks I need to keep track of. I uninstalled than installed pocket brilliance which is close to perfect,
So far everything has been working well. I don't really need the premium features so everything that's available for free is just enough for me.,
"Love the interface. easy to organize with combination of projects, tags, and priorities.",
Im in love with this app soo much .but one disappointment is that it is not fully free .i was ble to put only 3 projects.but daily use of this app is perfect.,
Excellent! I found it really convinient to be able to edit my to do list both from my phone and my laptop.,
"A very helpful app. I'm using the free version, it would be nicece to have an sms type notification system.",
integration with Google calendar is pretty good and combining that with a pomodoro timer is great for productivity.,
The app is good but 50$/y for premium is simply ridiculous. So frustrating to have to move to another app.,
The most well rounded task manager app out there. Premium necessary for most features but is well priced for students like myself,
Todoist & GTD methodology has completely revolutionized my life and my way of doing things. Forever grateful for this software and the GTD methods that it helps me apply.,
Overall the best to do list app to organise your daily schedule. Actually helps in easily completing the task.,
"Todoist helps me to manage my tasks and to control my productivity, especially I really like collaboration feature. Good job guys.",
"One of the best apps ever, I've tried plenty of to do apps but using todoist for years I simply cannot live without it.",
It's a simple to-do list app. Exactly what I needed. Without annoying adds and very simple,
"Very helpful with creating tasks, prioritizing, and execution. Great tool to have for organization!",
Latest update has broken the app and made it unusable. Creating a task makes the app crash.,
Update: Recent version 9498 has bought the app back to its reliability on older Android versions. Thanks for your persistence.,
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.,
"An app the puts me on the, with Todoist I break down big aims into small tasks per day helping me enjoying the progress Its the best out there, after I've tried several",
"Ultimately the best to-do list. I've been using it since years already. Highly recommended. Noone paid me to write this. I pay Todoist for Premium version, though.",
"Sorry but I won't install this app before you do install it check this app and privacy concerns, check under the tab about this app permissions and you can see that it has more or less acces to all your phone's information that sucks no thank you.",
Very confusing User Interface I tried to add a few tasks but so its confusing I decided to uninstall it and not to mess it anymore.,
"Reminders are a PREMIUM feature for some ungodly reason. They are a must for a todo app, what's point of writing it down if you keep FORGETTING it?!",
It spams your mailbox with reminders and it isn't obvious how to unsubscribe. Not very user friendly. AVOID.,
"Very useful. One can make tasks repeat, and rank them based on priority.",
On the free version. Very intuitive and has made a difference to my organisation. Thank you!,
My go-to app for taking note of my college assignments and exams! I won‚Äôt turn back to any other app cuz Todoist is just THAT good.,
The free tier is close to useless and coming from Ticktick I found Todoist pricier and work fewer features.,
"Found something that works with me, not against me. I'll never find a perfect solution, but I keep trying and todoist is the closest to my ideal method.",
Great app over web and mobile. I love the ability to sync with my Google Calendar!,
"Best task manager I have used. Simple, straightforward and works seamlessly across platforms.",
I just want to put a time in the task without it triggering the date function... it's too good at its job,
Love Todoist. Use it every day on desktop and phone. The widgets could be better but the app is amazing,
Need to pay to get reminders? The whole part of a to-do list is too be reminded. It's so pay to win =/,
"A lovely nice looking interface but one that isn't cluttered and confusing, just what I want in an app like this",
Nice and lightweight tool for my personal project and weekly todos. Some small ui quirkiness which is only why I don't rate it 5 stars.,
"Pretty good app, but crashes sometimes if you do something unexpected EDIT:contacted you with a crash description",
Amazing App. Does exactly what I need to capture and organize all that I need to do as an executive.,
Great app. I use it to remind myself of payments i need to make. Very simple to use and also handy.,
Good app too organize yourself. Not spammy. I get one notification a day. One in the morning and thats pretty much it,
"Great App! Purchase Plan, i.e. subscription, the necessity to subscribe guarantees that I have no way to have it.",
"Powerful and flexible, Todoist has the best feature set of the various productivity apps I've tried thus far",
"This is the best app for task management. I love the UI, especially the dark mode.",
"This is a really good app, the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do.",
First day of really actually using the app and they want me to rate it. so far the app works good. I haven't used it much at all.,
A really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it.,
The Best! No doubt this is the best todo management app. It has all the features I want. Todoist has the best UX!,
"Great app, switched from iOS to android and the app I used before isn't on android. Minimalist is great, I think this app is a step ahead.",
"Worth every cent. I don't regret paying for the premium. Being honest, this app is an essential part of my productivity.",
"Vry good app, tho I was just deleting one of my tasks at night and almost got a heart attack from the sound it made 3 seconds after üòÇ üòÖimma find out tmrow if theres a setting",
Very helpful for school and organizing. This has been my go-to app for the past few years <3,
Good way to organize all my tasks. Love the rescheduling option and weekly view !,
"Game changer. Most productive I have been in years, primarily use the upcoming view and schedule tasks.",
"I tried several To Do List apps, and I like this one the best. I especially like the option to assign priorities.",
Easy to use and helpful for keeping track of my schoolwork and personal goals.,
"Would like more options for when I can view things but overall, one of the best productivity apps on Android.",
"Back to being the best Todo app. Had some issues in the past updates but got fixed very fast with this update, good one!",
Best app of all time.,
"Great, but lacking moments feature - still you can simulate this technique by adding recurring tasks which remimds me to review my todo list",
Great. Minimal. Sublime.,
Great app to organize your tasks and plan your day. I'm very satisfied with the premium features as well.,
"Stops midway, no response for days.",
"Looks good, works well (except on windows) and nice calendar integration.",
very good app.,
Gets the job done. Simple and highly efficient - no learning curve.,
Use this app to keep track of all my school due dates - simple app I can access from anywhere. Love it!,
Easy to use. The layout is good. I used this app for homework tasks and errands at home.,
Quick and simple to use. I especially like the long press on the app icon to add a task quickly,
"It really has a minimalism design and functionality, as I prefer to be. Helpful app, thanks devs!",
Gets the job done very well! Helps keep track of things necessary and streamlining is awesome!,
"This app was so amazing. I don't feel disappointed after downloading this app. Actually, it is simple and great. Keep up the good work. (Sorry for my bad english üôèüòì)",
I have just uninstall it cuz you have to pay to get the basics options. If i can give it -5 stars i will do it. shame!!,
It's disappointing that basic things like reminders are a paid feature.,
"What good is a todo list app without a reminder, why would you make the most important thing a premium feature. Don't download this app it's USELESS!!",
I'm using this app for a few week now. It's the best app I've ever used for my to-do lists and schedule. Beyond my expectations.,
"Brilliant App, seems extremely intuitive, i find using this app keep everything organised which helps with busy lifestyles.",
"I find the app very comfortable and easy to use. I recommend using it, as it very meaningful and helpful for me!",
The only task management app I have been able to use for more than two weeks. Now at 4 months. Love it!,
"Great I'm still working out a solid work flow, but there have already been drastic improvements in my organization and productivity",
I've been using this for years and it helps me stay on top of my daily tasks! I would give it 6 stars if I was able. Definitely recommend this application.,
"First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app.",
"Doesn't display instances of recurring tasks, making it totally useless for forward planning. Uninstalled.",
"it helps me to manage our day to day things.& also didn't let me to forget things that I have to do. thank you & a better app, so anyone could have this.",
Downloaded to test alarm /reminder capability but was unable to trial without paying. Come it wouldn't kill ya to offer Pro features for a week,
"Exactly what I was looking for. Free version is sufficient for most use cases, and the full version is great!",
There are better options available. I just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app. I tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and I am going to try another.,
I only use it for simple reminders and lists but it works great and syncs across all my devices,
Adding a picture to a task is a paid feature... So free version is not great.,
it's been a best app to keep track of the planned task. I have been using this app for more than 5 years or so. I couldn't use and found any other app like this.,
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme.",
an amazing app. very well built and really helps my productivity. I highly recommend you give it a try!,
We use it for running our home & project improvements. It is easy to use.. not as user attractive as some but ok.,
Already such a great app and then you guys release more premium features for the free version. You guys are the real MVPs!,
one suggestion: allow the return key to work so as to make a vertical list under one entry. Other than that it's üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,
Looks great but reminders need a pro subscription. This is what I basically wanted the app for. Uninstalled it.,
"Haven't tried it yet, but give me some time to analyze it's performance.",
Great app! I use it every day. I use a list for everything. I love having different types of lists too.,
Had to use email or other login to start using. Not great when i want to see if the app is any good. Uninstalled instantly.,
"App is good, but it's stuttering in my phone. Kindly update it and make it smooth.",
useful so.... way to schedule and add i often do .. reschedule stuff. keeps a good running list of this things i need to get done,
So far so good. Helps organize my scattered thoughts and keep track of what I should prioritize.,
"great appüíñ but I think more can be done considering aesthetics, things like making the home screen widget transparent and so on :)",
Very good. It's worth using properly. Take a little time to learn everything about it and you will find that you have more time and less stress.,
"Simply the best organizer app I have ever, ever had. It changed my life forever. I just can't say how greatful I am for this app. Thank you!",
Great app. Wish it would sync with a few more business tools but it is a great organization app.,
"Such a nice app to keep you on track every step of the way, too bad half the features on it are for paid subscribers only,",
"Just started using, really enjoy it the more and more I organize my projects. Will update again in future.",
Full power app! Sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own. Otherwise amazing.,
Good app for keeping track of things. Wish it'd be easier to make notes on specific tasks.,
The Android app is a bit buggy: when switching view the task list remains frozen on the previous view until you scroll or tap.,
"Just needed somthing to record things I have to do and to remind when I should do them, then got hit instantly with a paywall, not a cool start tho.",
"Quick to add to dos, organize them and move them around. I'm quite forgetful, and this keeps me effective.",
Great app with a simple to use platform. Keeps all of my to dos in priority and organized for a steady productive day.,
"Very simple and intuitive. Easy to organize, and clean ui.",
Delightfully clean interface and a great range of features even in the free edition,
Love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now I do not get reminder for anything on time.,
find the reschedule function especially helpful. it's been a superb tool so far.,
"Team , I took subscribtion but app is not working. I try to add task but I can't see the text etc. Something is wrong.",
Really enjoy keeping track of my tasks so easily. Fills my need for accomplishment by checking off completed tasks.,
"This is a wonderful app, thanks to which I became very and very organized. I am grateful for its creation to its developers!!!",
The best productivity app ever used. My day starts with this app. Well designed and continuous improvement makes it the best app.,
I use the free version and it's very easy & helpful with adding tasks & reminders.,
"Easy, useful app that connects all my platforms. Makes connecting in the business a breeze",
"Very good but could be better e.g. sync with google calendar, tag people in tasks (not just on shared projects).",
Very good and practical to-do list app. I am using the free version and it is doing what it should perfectly.,
"It's a great app! But the main thing is, it is easy to use. And also, it automatically recognises the date I have set. So, I'm giving it 5 stars.",
Great app. Used it to run projects at work as well as day - to - day task. Have great control regarding day.,
The app is good. But I am unable to sync it with Google calender on my phone. Please help,
Werry cool app to memorise things that you need to do. I recommend this app for everyone that don't want to write tasks down on real paper.,
"Its a great app, but I can't give it 5 stars because the app asked me to rate it and I don't want to reward that behavior. Devs if I really want to rate your app you won't have to ask stop begging me to rate your app. Cut it out.",
Unhappy with the paid version. The reminder function isn't straight forward and hasn't worked for me,
A beautiful piece of software. It's only downside (which is an upside to some) is that it's SaaS.,
Widget buttons do not work,
Solid to do list app. Even at the free/intro level I don't feel super constrained.,
"simple, easy to use and not bloated with useless options or features. I love it!",
It's great at organising my project's tasks for home DIY and helping me get a lot more done in a note efficient way.,
I have uninstalled this app and unsubscribed from emails and yet it continues to send me emails. FIX THIS AND STOP SENDING ME EMAILS!!!,
I'd like to try apps that don't require an initial log in to see how to use.,
I'd like a faster option to delete tasks instead of selection and using the side menu.,
I've tried a bunch of to-do apps and this is my favorite to date. Versatile without getting too complex.,
Thanks for this very helpful tool,
It's great both as a free user and premium. I've tried both. My favourite app for keeping all lifes task on,
Condensed widget is amazing. Really good use of the space and a confirmation popup to prevent misclicks.,
"It's got a lot of features, even though a lot is in premium it's got everything to keep everything organized.",
Very easy to use and the best app in this category. I had this app on iphone and now I install on my new android. Todoist makes me an organized person :),
Love it. Recommended by a class I took on productivity. Huge boost to my planning and way lower stress.,
"Best ToDo list, has projects, priorities and integrations like Google Calendar sync. Use it daily and love it",
"Like it, helps me a lot. Just sometimes it opens on Today despite my project is customized as landing page.",
"Good app, I have used it steady for a couple of months now. The filtering feature is handy",
"Todoist suddenly starts reminding me that I have no tasks for the day. I have all notifications off, stop that!",
Great way to track personal projects and be motivated to complete the steps. Really love this app!,
Really nice app. Very user friendly. 5 stars when subtasks are usable (when I can view them on my daily task list),
Seriously? Reminder is a premium feature? What's the point of all this then? 1 star. I can understand comments and labels but reminders? At least other paid apps give reminders.,
"good clean app, would be nice if there's an option for loopable tasks (daily/weekly/monthly/twice a week)",
"Best ToDo app from the ones I've tried. Elegant: everything you need is there, but there is no over-functionalization.",
Todoist is very intuitive and resourceful! I'm really enjoying my experience with this app!,
Very functional and well designed. Actually aids in getting tasks done.,
Firdt of all thanks a lot for the app! Would be great to have an ability to create subtasks for todays tasks.,
i hate the checkbox so much... Please make an option to remove them. Totally ruined the old nice swiping experience.,
Widget does not sync to app. The app was listed as not-optimized as well.,
I wanted to try this as an alternative to Any.do or Microsoft ToDo but it's a joke if a basic function like a reminder is a paid feature.,
"Hands downs, without a doubt, the unequivically best task management app available; full stop.",
"This app is a surrogate for my memory. I'm using the free version, and it's been extremely useful so far.",
"Please make your widgets follow System Dark Theme. UPDATE: Close they have ""Dark Dynamic Color"" but it still doesn't change depending if the device theme changes to light or dark automatically.",
"In use for over 2 years, it has all functionality needed for slef organization. Thank you.",
Latest update has made the app practically unusable. Constantly crashes when actioning any item.,
Great experience. I will have love that there will be an added feature to have notes against task created or completed.,
"Users are choosing privacy more, so should this amazing app. It's got Facebook trackers embedded & no focus on privacy. It should be implemented.",
Super useful. Templates for recurring projects are an awesome feature.,
I would probably call to do as the second best task application there's definitely a lot of room for improvement.,
It has no option for offline mode without account. You have make account and things to get started.,
"A pretty easy way to keep track of tasks and set reminders, whether recurring or not",
Ease of use is fantastic. Helps add some organization to my schedule without much effort.,
This app options is more than other similar ones specially priority but there is a problem that would better if you add timer or focuos mood,
"Exceptional, really helps track objectives and goals in a clear way.",
"good application, the free version is very limited since most of the functionality is in the payed version.",
"If you are a free user this app not suitable for you, because the most important thing ""task reminder"" option only for premium user which not available for free user. Most to do app give this option for free user üôÑüôÑüôÑ",
Great App so far! I only have a question: Is it possible that the completet tasks don't disappear when checked?,
"Best to-do app ever. Easy to use, easy to organise. It clearly made me more productive.",
Keeps me structured and organized. Premium is definitely a game changer.,
"Still figuring it out and getting in the habit of organizing myself, but I love how I can break down projects or task",
Solid to-do-list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7-days ahead. The best app in my opinion,
"Great app, seamlessly syncs with the PC app as well. Very well polished.",
it is still killing my time.,
"Custom Filters, Labels, Comments and attachments ARE THE PREMIUM FEATURES with around ‚Çπ3100 per year... I wasted my time by downloading it.",
This is an idiotic app. First asks fkr all details including email. And then sends lot of junk mail. Uninstalling it. Nothing special about it.,
It's the best GTD based time management app out there. And it works fine across all platforms.,
So easy to keep a list of everything from work and home together and section them out. I love it!,
I'm new and still learning. It's a great app for planning your daily schedule. enjoying it so far.,
The to-do board is an absolute must for productivity gains. Loved the UI üòª amazing job from the Todoist team üí™,
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.,
"One of the most overrated to-do apps. When I point out the issues, I receive cold response.",
"I can no longer get reminders with the free version, which makes this useless to me. Currently looking for a new app to use...",
"Awesome app! Smart natural language syntax support for task management, cool UX and multi-device sync.",
"Still getting used to it. I prefer typing tasks in on my laptop, but really like that I can see them on my phone when I'm out.",
"This would be a fabulous app if you could set tasks to reoccur weekly, monthly, yearly. Ugh!",
Love it! Allows me to write things down as they come to me then prioritize and schedule accordingly.,
It was a really good app you may add reminders and if you didn't it from time to another push a notification for you,
Great way for me to manage a time sensitive workload for multiple design client's and keep my home life organised at the same time.,
"Its the most amazing app i have ever come across , helps with managing and organizing tasks , its awesome , ddefenotely recommend it ,,,",
I've used several and this is the best I've used. Clean interface and every feature I want.,
Simply the best planner. Love it to the core. I have introduced your app to over 2000 students we train across various mba colleges in India,
Desktop version is great! Mobile version is almost as good and I use both. would recommend,
"Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects)",
This app is completely amazing. Many colleagues in my workplace use it. The pro version is worth it.,
Ok. Not as easy to add a project after task has been entered. A little clunky moving task to next day.,
really like the app a lot. the projects make it great to organize a bunch of disparate things,
Most features gated behind premium. UI difficult to use for setting recurring tasks for a future date.,
Amazing app. Such a simple yet brilliant idea. I've already seen a huge improvement in my productivity.,
"I like this app, but maybe you can add some schedule like note, not just to do list",
It does not have a language change feature But it is good in other respects,
"Oh God, I was searching for this for so long, and I mistakenly though any.do was it, and I remembering it just not being correct. Here's to hoping, this is just as good as it used to be! :D",
This is a great to do list app. And it sends reminders so you don't forget your tasks!,
It has been very helpful in getting to set and achieve the various tasks and reminders I have!,
"It is really an awesome way to clear your mind and to make sure you never forget anything, big of small.",
it's an awesome app I just wish that it would work better with Google. The system for creating new tasks using ok Google could be a lot better.,
"I first used to use this extension on my laptop, but I found this app, and I was delighted!they both are very nice.",
works very well. would like to see an option to make more than one list and choose which one to display,
"Love it. It's simple, but just the thing I need to keep my to-do list written down and handy for easy access.",
"eventhough i am disable and terminal, todoist allows me to be productive. I can not tell you what a wonderful gift that has been to me. It pushes me to live life to the fullest! I praise God for this program ... there is life after a career. Thank you!",
Helps me keep on top of everything I need to do. I especially like being able to organize my lists and even color code them.,
"Great application, use it from mobile, home and office desktops. Also sharing from Microsoft Teams is very useful",
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue.",
"Loads of features, everything you'd need in a todo app, very critical part of my life and managing my day to day chores as a brain injury survivor.",
"its just good. stick to it and you will see results, and see how much more time you really do have!",
Can't even use labels for free - it's a premium feature! Uninstalling on principle.,
Very basic. No reminders in free version. Useful UI though.,
"love the simplcity and intuitive-ness of this app, the layout makes it easy to use and helps me stay organised",
The best app ever !,
This app is such high quality in its usage and visual design. It's on par with the quality you'd expect from Google.,
one of the best ToDo/Task list apps i have ever used. it seems to do it all! BUT TOO EXPENSIVE,
"Long time user. Works well for my use case, which is mostly basic to-do-list, but also GTD method.",
"an amazing app, helps me keep myself organized while I'm under severe pressure from university and work load.",
Is a great app to help you keep track of your schedule and also help assist with breaking down tasks on projects üòÅ,
This is really good how it links into Google calendar.. keeps me on track with random day to day jobs id otherwise forget or be late with.,
it has a user-friendly and super easy interface. kudos!!,
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists,
"excellent. free app that syncs lisys across browser and phone, works oretty seamlessly.",
"Easy to use, great repetition features, helps me keep my tasks in sync between my desktop and mobile",
"Has every feature I need, basically the ultimate todo app! I loved the syncronization with Gmail and Google Callander.",
"obsessed with this app - with the integration with google calendar, keeps my entire life on track. 10/10 would recommend",
Love having Google assistant integration (through IFFT) and being able to share lists. My two deal breakers!,
"Superb to-do list that is so much more as well: project manager, business planner etc. Highly recommended.",
Use it every day to organize my life. It is easy to use and synchs with my Google calendar.,
Splendid app that I believe has the perfect mix between utility and simplicity.,
Great transition from our beloved Wunderlist. All tasks imported and now enjoying additional features offered by Todoist.,
"This app has changed how I manage my life. I am less stressed out because I can keep track of everything in one place, and I can feel at peace at the end of the day.",
I'm only a week 1 but so far it's been very easy to operate to go in to make changes. I can't wait to figure out how to use it to its fullest!!,
I never got further than the first screen because I don't see why I need to login with an account to simply make lists.,
"Excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment, reminder etc are locked on free edition",
This app is great but can you please add a Black amoled theme,
Does everything I need it to do. I like the natural language code you can use to set up repeating tasks.,
Sync across devices easily and quickly. Easy to create lists and love the layout,
awesome!!!!! i use this app everyday. it keeps me organized and i get so much done. I love checking off things on my list!,
Simple & easy to use. Task capture is excellent. Super easy.,
Great app. Can you please add transparent widget show that it will cover my full screen and look good with my wallpaper?,
"Best todo app i've ever used, and has helped me with alot of personal and professional work.",
Really enjoy the simplicity of this tool. Great for organizing my thoughts and actions.,
Excellent. Is so helpful helping me out with the reminders and I love how I can schedule things for future days as well,
"No easy way to import or export tasks in a non-proprietary, other app (e.g. Google Tasks) compatible format.",
"Can change the layout for Android tablets, it would be much better than now it is. It's good and I like it",
"There is tricky way to crash the app: delete task from widget, tap ""recents apps"" button, open an app (infinite loader is here), tap on three dots menu.",
"First heard from Tim Challies in ""Do More Better."" Very helpful productivity app. Use with browser on laptop too!",
"Good alternative to clickup, notion etc as far as personal productivity hours. Good for eisenhower matrix lovers.",
This app is so easy to use. I enjoy finishing my tasks a lot more. Really boost my productivity,
I think if there was a bit more flexibility wi5h how you can combine multiple deadline dates then it'd be 5 stars.,
"Handy tool I use daily. No ad junk interferences, simple, clean. I recomend for ppl who like simple.",
"This app is ok, but it really needs start date functionality. Their reasoning behind not adding it is terrible.",
"I think it's a bit silly that reminders & labels are premium features, but other than that: great app!",
it helped me to stick to my newly formed habits and organize my daily routines. thank you!,
Fixed the crashes - works perfectly now. Can't remove my earlier review for some reason.,
Reminders locked behind pro version so this app is useless to me. I will not pay for features I haven't had a chance to test.,
"The best time management app 3 years using it and it keeps me organised,efficient and productive.",
"good üëç, meets my expectations",
"this app is good, but I would like it if you guys could add like shopping list to it, and not just to do list. :)",
"The unpaid version is still useful enough to be beneficial, and has been a great help in managing my tafe assignments",
"I absolutely love the GUI and widgets, keeps everything organized and in my face. Exactly what I need",
I use Premium option for 2 years and I really like it. Simple but nice application.,
"Pretty much perfect. Love the natural language pickup mostly, feels great to use.",
Not as advertised,
"Requires a login to function, making it pretty clear what they're in business for. I'd rather pay for the app.",
It is good but mobile app doesn't have many options and many features are not accessible to free users.,
"I am really enjoying this app...only complaint is I am not sure how to make a list, within a single task, but that may just be lack of knowledge on my part",
this app saves time and is convenient to all students or workers. I absolutely love it!,
"Two word - Paid mess. Please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice , just go for a better app.",
"It's so easy to work with todoist as a planner , but I just have a tiny problem. Where can I see my completed tasks? Is there an option to make them visible?",
Perfect balance of useful features and a minimalist interface.,
I've been using Todoist for years. It's lightweight and does everything intended well in a simple way.,
Love this app. Use it with the chrome extension on your laptop to quickly task email follow ups and project goals.,
Love all the ways to categorize my tasks. Also great that it integrates with my Google calendar.,
"I wish there was a way to check the things you've already done in a day, but it's still a great app for what it is. It's a to-do list and it feels good when you check off an item.",
Very useful app for managing school work and long term projects. Highly reccomend!,
Top notch. Simple and effective. Wish it integrated with Google Assistant.,
"The monthly payments make the application a bit expensive, but the functionality is great",
"You cannot sort list in alphabetical order! That's a very basic feature, seriously?",
"I really like how they register tags like 'Something to be done everyday', it will take everyday tag and will actually remind you everyday.",
Easy to use across all devices. Helps me keep track of my dozens and dozens of due dates a month.,
Really helps me keep organized and on-time. This software has become my everyday tool.,
So far so good. I've not used any other function besides listing the activities and scheduling.,
Limiting sections is ridiculous .... so if you want to add things for 30 days you need to have seperate projects.,
Monthly sub for a reminder feature is laughable. App is totally basic with no features your basic note taking app doesn't have,
LOVE their open API which lets me automate and add my own features. It has completely chsnged how i organize my life.,
"After the latest update widget stopped working. It's blank (have no tasks) all the time, no matter what I pick. Latest version + zenfone 5",
Thank you for this great app! Is it possible to force RTL layout in the list items that appears in the widget?,
An excellent online to do list that updates on various platforms. Very pleased with it.,
Awesome! Finally found what I was looking for and it's straight forward. No typical bait and switch,
Very useful task manager. It's really intuitive and simple to use.,
"the UX for selecting date/time is terrible! otherwise, this is the best tasks app.",
"Stupid app. After you created list of tasks, it will be removed then they will ask to restore if you buy the premium license. Fraud!",
"It really is useful I love the interface itself, really is straightforward and aesthetically pleasing",
It is a good way to keep track of what needs to be done. I like the features that allow me to prioritize tasks or color-code projects.,
"Simple, modern, easy to learn application. My productivity soared with todoist.",
Great app that helps me organize and track the many projects and tasks I have to manage and complete on a daily basis,
"Looks great but no option to save to SD card, and I need phone space, so have to uninstall.",
Free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done.,
"Overly complicate, have to pay if you actually want to get reminders. Waste of my time!",
I love this app. It syncs to google calendar and helps keep me on track with tasks.,
"It keeps my life organized, and gives me a sense of accomplishment know if to do items.",
"Great app, easy to use. Would love to see the addition of Defer/Start dates like OmniFocus has.",
Great tool. Enough functionality to adapt it to how you want to manage your day to day.,
love the app. but could you give the option to toggle whether you want tasks of sub projects to be displayed or not?,
Its perfect for student's like me who take every day as challenge and tend to forget what's important each day.,
Great app for getting things off of your mind in order to stop having to constantly remind yourself of what you have to do and when you have to do it.,
"Honestly, the price point for premium is a no brainer. Combined with free toggl account is just about anything you'd need",
"Really like this app, even if you chose to stay with the free version it's a hell of a useful app.",
Amazing amazing app. The UI is so convenient. I maximised my productivity in a month with this app.,
Its a really great app to keep track of your activities especially if you have trouble with staying organised,
To-Do List is much better now and wish it would and will help me on my Schedules and reminders. Thank you Todoist.,
cant change my email it just gives me an error message,
"Helps me get more things done, very useful since I have ADHD, which can REALLY get in the way of being productive",
Finally found an easy to use to do list app with all the functionalities it needs. Very satisfied with this,
Uninstalled for only 1 reason. It syncs only alexa to-do list and alexa shopping list. Does not sync custom lists created on alexa.,
I liked the markdown support. Links editing in WYSIWYG mode is a total disaster.,
Life saver! This app has been a great help in increasing my productivity. Well organized and easy to use.,
Very useful app in managing tasks and getting them completed in timely manner on regular basis.üëç,
"Best to-do app I've ever used. So simple, yet so effective. And the dark theme is just something I cannot live without.",
I am trying to login from my mobile device but unable to login through my email it's only working with Google Apple and Facebook. Look into this matter please.,
Fantastic app to set up repeating tasks. I love the interface across phones and it's web site,
"Its practical, intuitive, well designed. They obviously have good product managers",
This is my preferred app for managing my priorities and obligations. This app is simple and has a very clean user-interface,
It helps me keep up with daily chores. Having the reminder emails is a plus.,
Please don't install the app. Their use and keep your email to send spam if you already unistalled their app long ago.,
Made life simple....awesome app. Does exactly what I needed. Simplified my day to day appointments.,
"Super cool App that allows you to plan different activities with couple, family and friends!",
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding?? I've never deleted an app so fast,
Great task list app. Would love more customization options with the theme colors and font/UI choices.,
"Straightforward goal-setting, considering upgrading to premium because I like it so much.",
Very efficient way of organising notes and keeping track of what tasks have been accomplished.,
Not too complicated like clickup. The basic functions are enough for me to stay productively..,
I really enjoy the simplicity of this app! The sub-task feature is very helpful.,
This app is very useful. It divides your whole day into multiple tasks to make the day achievable.,
I have found this app to help keep me on track throughout my workday and reminds me to do things for home as well.,
By far the absolute best to-do app! The free version is great and the paid version is even greater!,
"Easy to use, intuitive, simple interface, effective.",
sync is a nightmare. email support just going in circles. basically a broken service.,
"Quick to add and complete tasks, effective reminders, good integration with Gmail.",
"This is a really good app, always helps me stay organized. I 100% recommend this app, you will love it,",
This app and platform works wonderfully. The user interface is friendly and easy to navigate.,
I love it! I'm so forgetful. I love being able to put in quick reminders and done!,
"Very useful! I'm in my second year and I use it more and more, for personal and business to do lists!",
"Amazing app. I use it all the time to keep track of my daily, and weekly tasks",
"Pretty cool app, simple, does what's intended to. Wish I could plan longer more easily though.",
I very appreciate that this Todoist app can really assist me to make important things done! Thank you! Let us have a wonderful summer!,
Use to be my favourite app but I can't recommend because they don't send you a notification when a task is due :(,
"I've been using it for several years. I wouldn't change it with anything else. Very stable, fast and easy to use.",
This app was great until recent update. It now crashes regularly and has become unusable.,
"Tried a few different personal productivity apps, this is the first which feels like it will stick.",
My favourite to-do app of them all! This one isn't complicated at all to use so it makes me want to use it more!,
Keeps me on track with all of my many projects and the minute details of things I work on. =] I really have a lot of projects!,
First task mgmt app that I have used almost daily for 3 weeks so far. Very easy to use.,
Loving it! And I can share different projects with different people. Pretty awesome!,
No integration with Google assistant. Will probably leave for more integration of hands free control.,
"Very effective app, works across platforms, simplify your life, outsource your short term memory",
"Everything is good but there is a minor bug while using the widget, i hope you guys will figure it out soooooon...üòÄ",
"When the virtues that set it apart are premium-only features, there's no incentive to stick with this app.",
Please solve bugs. On android I cant see any projects. Something went wrong after the user interface changed:(,
Very helpful for reminding me that I haven't done certain tasks and keeping me doing things I otherwise might procrastinate over.,
"Absolutely beautiful app. I couldn't do without it. Well done guys. And the best thing is, it is always being improved and updated. Love it. Cheers",
"Really intuitive and clean interface, much better than Microsoft To-do",
"I started a new job as head of the department, and had no organizing skills. This app has changed my life.",
LOVE this app! It helps me aave paper and I still get the satisfaction of checking my to do list boxes!,
One of the best to-do list apps i have used.,
"Best to do list and project management in the market, and the paid version really worth it!",
I don't use most of the app features but the widget is really nice for quick notes and reminders,
Finally a to do that really makes life better. Accessible from everywhere with great UI,
"Great app, I use it daily and find it very useful. I have tried many ToDo apps and keep coming back to Todoist.",
"amazing app tbh, love that it's available on both pc and mobile. features are extraordinary and easy to use",
I have legitimately been more productive since using this app. Very appealing design and solid user experience. üëç,
so far so good. upgrading makes it easy to use additional organizational tools.,
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634,
Really easy and great that it links to my pc. Just what I needed to try and get organised!,
It's flexible when I'm on a creative streak & easy when getting out of bed is a task.,
I had a real improvement in my workflow some I've started using Todoist. It became an essential part of my daily organization.,
Getting works done thanks to this app! scheduling tasks both individual & project groups is super easy üëè PS this apps Ui is better on iOS than om Android,
After recent update Todoist widget does not show tasks texts. It only shows dates.,
What I was missing in all the other to do list apps. I signed up for a membership after two days!,
"Subtasks & task-specific comments - wonderful! I haven't fully vetted it, but so far I love it!",
This app helps me a lot to organize my life. The new template feature is amazing.,
"I am student and so many things to learn and complete the task but some time not remember, I am use this app todolist.",
"simple, clean interface, awesome for sharing tasks with others on collaborative projects",
Perfect - does everything I know to want and I keep finding features I didn't know I wanted until I saw them.,
I really like the widget feature with that so I can put the to-do list on the first thing on my phone it's really nice,
Great app supports cross platform and overall great experience and and one more thing it would be nice to have shared labels,
The widget does not function with respect to updation and also no function works properly on the widget.,
"Great to-do app, I truly adore the whole ui/ux. Super smooth, intuitive and extremely useful",
"Switched after using Google Keep for years, and it changed my life! I'm laser-focused and productive now :-D",
It does pre-loaded tasks that can't be removed and it's not free if you want ut to set a reminder you have to pay for pro,
"Exactly what I was looking for, simple, intuitive, unobtrusive todolist",
It's wonderful for keeping track. Even the free version contains so much!,
"App crashes constantly after latest (Feb 8 2023) update. Was an excellent app before, please fix!",
todoist has made me feel more productive than ever before. have been using todoist as a college student now for a year and I love it!,
"great overall, some annoying bugs in the automated but over-zealous scheduling algorithm",
Some premium features should be free ! Otherwise good tool to manage one's projects.,
Great app to help keep me organized. It's become a regular part of my day. Highly recommend!,
"it's the best to-do list app i have ever used, i used to use wunderlist, evernote, keep. but none of them is better than todoist",
Overall it's a great app I just wish I could link it with my Google calendar or that it worked better with Google assistant,
Just the thing for this ADHD adult. And the premium features are well worth the price.,
love it! use it as part of my t r o system. especially love how I can link tasks directly to open emails.,
The app was doing well but it doesn't let me order the tasks in the way I want.,
This is an excellent app with good integration with gmail and is an apt replacement for the native google tasks app.,
"free, syncs lists, intelligent... nothing more was needed. Love it!",
"first login and the app keeps stopping after not even a second, have unistalled and downloaded the app again still the same problem",
so simple so effective. add the widget click plus add a task. click complete from widget too. changed my life,
extremely annoying multiple Popups to get the full version when creating a quick (!) task,
"It's exceptionally good app, i can reach it from my pc, mac and phone at the same time!!!",
I love having a widget on my phone where I can keep track of important things. I use it to keep track of bills and their due dates.,
Great everyday tool.. Have been using it gor almost 2 years now and cannot imagine being without it.,
"A lot of features, have not explored them all. Thus far very helpful.",
Overly complicated. Overpriced. Paid for a month. Wasted money. Need a manual to use it.,
Go for Microsoft To-Do list. It offers everything for FREE and it has also has native windows app.,
Love it! Easy project organization and to do list option. The widget for Andriod is AMAZING!,
I wish I could keep the left panel menu open. I hate clicking a hamburger menu on the bottom to choose other folders,
Great App. Free version work well for organizing multiple responsibilities. love it!,
"Due to an unknown error, I couldn't sign up first, but now everything works fine :)",
good app for a to do list and daily reminders. easy to use and very trustworthy.,
Fabulous app for organising your life. You quite simply brain dump all your reminders in here to free yourself to focus on living,
Very good. Already helping me get things done. Easy and intuitive to use. Would reccomend.,
I love the ability to prioritize tasks and set reminders in the app so you'll remember to complete everything,
"Cheating!!! Upgrade to premium account, already paid via credit card but feature are not unlocked!!!! Keep saying on processing",

This is my 3rd time using Todoist Premium but don't like it's features. Switching to alternative.,
Time reminder available to to premium only ..??? Really !!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ pretty desperate to earn some bucks .,
Been using Todoist for over a year. Find it flexible and easy to use.,
"Excellent app , you can organicse your task easily , and a best thing about this app is that you can save the trees",
Nice if you're bad at remembering everything you have to do. Quick and convenient.,
Great app with a very good UI. It's definitely helped me improve my productivity.,
Keeps me focused!! But I don't want to purchase anything. I think it could all be free in my opinion.,
Very functiona! I'm loving it! :) Would have been better if there's a Calendar view :),
"My life is manageable now, and I do not forget things (well I do, but Todoist is there to remind me exactly when I need to be reminded).",

It definitely helps you be more productive and the interface is pretty easy to pick up on.,
So far so good! Supports kanban and it's completely simple to add and sort tasks.,
"I have been using this app forrr years, when ever I stop using it on a dialy basis, my producetivity and focus falls apart.",
"Its meh. Has a very boring, basic look.",
Todoist is super helpful for organizing tasks! So glad it was recommended to me. Thanks!,
Todoist can do a range of things from simple to complex depending on your wants and needs,
"The app is crippled unless you subscribe to premium, the price of which is much too high.",
I was super happy to download this app but that I soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your to-do list,
"This app has been perfect for me. It's really easy to use, fast and has just the right amount of features for me.",
"Love the app, it is so easy to use and set up my school work and other projects I'm working on in order to have a good work flow!",
It's a great app just not for me because I don't do things till the last minute. I believe there's room for improvement with the email service.,
I love this app. It improved my productivity and accountability tenfold. Don't read any more reviews. Just download it already.,
"simple, powerful task app. works with gmail great. keeps all tasks in one place.",
Great app to keep me up. Pls add more priority colour badges. Atleast 1 or 2 more. We need it. Pls,

superb for self management. Literally all my reminders are on the platform and it is one of the best,
I've been using it for a week and just enjoying how easier it became for me to stay productive through a whole day,
Excellent service.....making my day easier.... Really enjoying the service...... with in days the app become part of my life....,
Great app! I only wish the notifications would display as a push notification.,
It is great to get my to do list out of my head and onto a system where I don't have to carry notepads wherever I go.,
"It is a great app. Only been using a short time, so still learning. Will report back.",
"I've been using Todoist for a few months. I love it, super useful and robust.",
"Probably my favorite Android app. Incredibly well designed, functional, and fun to use!",
Can't print a list on Android. App is worthless to me. Get on the ball guys so it prints.,
"Actually the app is good, but the main part i.e Reminders is paid. Really unhappy about this. Reminder should not be paid.",
I manage multiple clients task list as well as my personal tasks. Easy to use.,
"this app helps me remind everything, and I've been more regular with my schedule, thank you todist!!!",
Very helpful and easy to use. It's helping me to not feel completely overwhelmed with all the chaos in my life,

great little app for keeping on top of things throughout the day and making lists.,
I love this app. No bugs or issues. It's done a lot to help me organize my work and personal to-do's.,
"It was ok, but lately its been annoying me with stupid, senseless push messages. So uninstalling it.",
"Best app to manage your to do list, and its syncing feature b/w laptop & mobile is amazing...",
I find this app usfull and given time to properly utilies all features of the app I believe it would be more so.,
Love the app but please bring back the previous function of sliding across when a task is completed.,
Great app - been using it for a couple of years now and it really helps me keep on track of all thw tasks I need to do,
It's good. If they can integrate maps then the world finally gets its pipboy.,
Excellent UI. Final a todo app that I think I will use for the long haul.,
Buggy. When I add a new label it crashes. For the rest good functionality,
"So far, it's really helping me to become more productive and building new habits. Not disappointed!",
"Powerful tool for creating categories of ""to do"" tasks, and these are synced across my various devices.",
After just a few days it's helping me tame the organizational nightmare of moving while making a living and staying balanced.,
Works great for sharing across my team for basic tasks. Makes manging tasks for others a breeze.,
"good app, but they keep giving me popups to review them even after I already did so. very annoying!!!!",
Very nice app. Almost all needs to kip track of own activities are fulfilled. Thanks.,
"Great app, only the subscription fee is a bit steep for what's on offer.",
It since I have this I have this account but it's not anywhere on my phone and I want to delete this account my camp it tells me how to do it to go to my profile to delete it yet I don't have the app. This is terrible,
I love this app. Nice customization and flexible. The widgets are awesome as well üòÄ,
my personal and professional work is more organised. helps me stay focused and not forget anything,
"Didn't like it, way too awkward to use and didn't sync well with my mail app",
"reminders, an extremely basic & necessary feature, not being free is insane",
Often crashed with dark theme :( But web version is good.,
"I live by this app, never forget a single task but the alarms rarely go off on time.",
I really like how it walks me thru becoming productive and learning how to prioritize with the tutorial.,
"really helpful, enjoying having my work much more organised and less daunting! thank you todoist people, you guys are ok!",
The one change I'd make... I wish I could change push notifications to only show tasks from certain projects,
Free version is great! Syncs up 2 ways with Google calendar which was a must for me.,
"My life is definitely going smoother wuth this app.even the most basic functions are useful, lots more to explore",
the app is awesome and does exactly what its supoosed to. the only flaw is in the operator.,
"Great experience so far, I have been using it for almost 2 years and it helps me not miss a task !",
works good! nicely persistent in reminders yet unobtrusive to be able to continue to focus.,
"Stupid app,even a reminder which is pretty much basic is under premium useless.Don't waste time in exploring this.Just go to any other nice applications",
"Works really well: simple to use but if you want, there are a lot of features you can use!",
When I open app only black screen appears and after sometime it shows the app is not working Thank you for fast reply,
Best to do list app I have used. It has all the features I want and works the way I expect it to.,
"Very good, but I'd like to be able to set a specific time in the day to do a task. But I love that it's ad free.",
I prefer Todoist over all the other tasks apps. Being able to connect it to Google Home is important to me.,
Best I've ever tried! You can stay organized as simple as black and white. It gets me.,
I'm using it daily since 3 months. I enjoy using the premium version as it is very handy to use.,
"Looks like it would be a nice app, but basic functionality like setting a reminder is an in-app purchase",
No longer useful. Task reminders are made premium feature. Moved to TickTick.,
I use it every day! it's great for keeping track of everything I need to do. Organized and easy to use: I love Todoist.,
Not for me. I couldn't get the integration with Google calendar to work. I only need something simple.,
"It's great. Sucks that you have to pay before you can access most of the greatness, but it's great.",
"Todoist is a clean, easy-to-use application and the Android app complements the web app perfectly.",
Love this app. The best organisation tool I've ever used. Would like to see a calendar view,
I use this daily. Very user friendly. Good repeating and postponing features.,
"Awesome app!! Theres so much u can do, so many features...way more then just a ""To-Do List""!?!",
"Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks",
"Reminders only available on prime if you purchase it. Nice way to catch you, be careful.",
"love the interface, the aesthetic and the functionality. I endorse this app.",
"The reason for 1 star rating is , there is no notification feature . At least give a notification feature for free",
Todolist has helped me organise and manage my work list very efficiently. Highly recommended!,
"This is a great app, it has made my life so much easier. I have tried other apps but this one has to be the best one so far. If you are thinking about getting it you should.",
Greatest scheduling app I've ever seen used. That's why I paid for annual subscription.,
It's very easy to add tasks with its incredible Natural Language Processing.,
Super easy to install and use. Highly functional free version with integrations üëèüèæ,
"Great productivity tools i use it with my linux desktop,please add feature pomodoro timer for tasks with statics it will be the best app.",
Honestly the best app I could ask for. Managing and completing tasks in a form of projects.,
"Easy to use, compatible with Wear Os. Use it as daily apps for tracking my task & really love it.",
So helpful for my productivity. really helps me stay on top of all my jobs and sort them into areas so I can juggle work (multiple jobs) and home and everything.,
"Awesome app with great features and user friendly interface, definitely recommend it 100%",
"Close to perfect, and I appreciate the integration with Microsoft Outlook.",
Very simple UI and great experience. Great work team todoist üëç.,
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?,
I don't understand why the changes I make in this app don't sync with Google Calendar. What am I missing?,
"Easy to organize with due dates, categories and sub-tasks.",
Very good task manager. Works on all popular platforms. Has good free plan.,
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.,
In order to get reminders (which is what a to do app is for) you have to pay for their premium subscription.,
"good but no reminders in free version, sole purpose of to do is getting reminded of the stuff we need to do.",
Brilliant app. Has given me greater focus and helped me reorganise all the jobs in my life. Great job üëè,
"Needlessly complicated and doesn't do reminders. If I remembered what I needed to do without reminders I wouldn't need a to-do list in the first place, would I?",
Who wants to pay $3 a month? The free version just tries to upsell you the premium version while you're trying to use it.,
Excellent to-do list application. I came from My Life Organized; I just need something simpler.,
"I really like this app! Wish it also had pomodoro timer like feature, have to use another app just for it.",
"Definitely worth the money for premium, it's built for organizational people (or disorganized people trying to get organized)",
One of the best investments in my life so far. This app really helps to offload things which need to be done from your head.,
"Not easy to set recurring dates or access calendar, interface looks good",
"great app, just wish for the ability to integrate with my calendar and send reminders",
Everything I need in a home and personal project management app. Not too complex but not too simple ‚ù§Ô∏è,
Clean interface. Excellent work flow. Intuitive.,
"Will be really helpful to mark a task as cancelled, for future rafferance, rather than deleting it or change the labal. Thank you!",
"What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!",
"It does everything that you can expect from an to-do list app, help me to be much more organized.",
"If we complete 1 task through widget, it close all other tasks already shows in widget. Irritating.",
Todoist helps keep me organized and productive. I highly recommend it for a to-do app.,
Microsoft To Do does almost all of this for free. It is pointless to pay such a hefty sum of money for these so-called premium features!!!,
Instantly uninstalling after finding that just adding a reminder is a premium feature.,
"Be a Do-ist!! Organized My life a lot. Even in free version, you can enjoy a huge utility.",
I tried a number of todo lists. This is by far my favorite. I keep it open on my computer and phone all day.,
I would use the app but it's a paid app and I'm not sure of its true value because I haven't used it. How is it better than keep or others that are (for lack of a better description) free.,
"$4 per *month* and no reminder functionality without it? You're joking, right? One star, uninstalled.",
"The widget doesn't work, I am not able to modify anything through widget",
"this really helped me get my work done, i can always trust it for a plan in a time crunch, when i need to just SPLURRRGEE my brain snot into something that could be productive",
"Great app, lots of useful features. Helps me to remember what I need to do throughout the day.",
Love it. Best way I have found to capture all aspects of life and keep my mind clear.,
I use it for over 2-3 years and really like it. Love the new boards too.,
This has been the most useful app I ever downloaded. Very easy to use too. I paid for the upgrade. Well worth it!,
Absolutely amazing. Really easy to work and the Karma points motivate me a lot.,
It is a smart click in mind...üòç üòé‚òùÔ∏èNow I am able to perform my tasks in an easy way.. very smoothly‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è..! I love todoist...üíûü•∞,
Well designed app / desktop task list. It is very customizable.,
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc",
Everything I clicked on its for premium account. That means I cant use it smoothly for free!,
"App works smoothly. Though I'd like if ticking a task produced a ""ting"" sound.",
"The idea of the app is great, but many services are paid. The free version is more limited than I thought.",
Great easy to use list making app. Just wish you could print lists,
"I like the fact that I can make a list, some call 'em projects, multiple lists of whatever I need",
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked,
I like using this app. I would love to see a sync between devices in future.,
Sporadic. Doesn't show notifications anymore. Only when I open the app.,
Upgraded to pro and never looked back. Single most important app on all my devices now!,
Its cool but ive been using it for a week now but sometimes i forget to check my tasks in-app dont know if it will become habit eventually or if i nees a reminder for that as well,
It is well organized and perfect for quickly recording homework for school.,
"Neat, does what you expect, with handy reminders and useful organisation of projects.",
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.,
It does what I want it to. Plan and get tasks done. Not overly complicated by things that I don't need.,
Pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added. I dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me.,
"It's a really great all, except that you can't make it buzz when you need to do something unless you pay.",
Truely exceptional app for staying organized at work and at home. I'm a Todoist for life!,
Excellent app. But... According Exodus contains 5 trackers. Come on... 21 century. Privacy is matter. Only 3 star.,
It's been an amazing app so far especially since I'm starting college and helping me organize my monthly drills,
Very intuitive UI and nice for the project management!!! Recommend! ++,
Reminders shouldn't be a paid feature. Basically undoes everything the app does well.,
"the best app Ive ever used for this. love their chrome extension. simply fantastic, might buy premium",
"Easily one of the most important apps I have in my aresenal. It seems simple, but wow is it powerful.",
Easy to use but some features are not clear. Nice dark theme.,
Why can't I reset my password no matter how much I try? App interface is good but so lagged and buggy.,
Wow after the last update i lost everything. All my notes. Insane. On samsung galaxy s21+. I hate it.,
phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer,
"Really great app! It's been few months I've switched to this app, and I haven't looked back",
Extremely helpful app! the interface is great and quite intuitive!,
Great UI. After trying other task management tools this is one of the best so far,
Just what's needed at times reminders until tasks are completed. Good idea.,
This app does not have reminded option. If we want to use remainder we have to upgrade and asking money to subscribe. So it's useless app,
Todoist is user friendly and it is really working for me in the way i like to schedule my tasks.,
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!,
"I love this app, using it for a while now, and I would love to continue using it, but since the latest update it constantly crashes. I can't even open it. Not sure what to do with it now...",
Strikes a good balance between being both feature rich and elegantly simple.,
"Since I usually have my phone nearby, this app is the easiest way to capture my to do thought as it comes to me.",
Helps me stay on track. Has reminders for tasks which I find invaluable.,
I need more details about the advance of the projects also a difference between a complete task and the death line (thanks for answering),
Best reminder app on the market. Easy to enter dates and times.,
Best thing is we can track the tasks completed on a particular day. I used it as result scoreboard,
this was the best ever app I used. I was never used to be productive like this ever before.I am achieving my daily goals every day. I am becoming different human being every day. thank you,
Great app! Even free functionality covers almost all my requirements! Kudos to developers!,
"Very nice working space, but the display of things can be a bit nicer.",
"Great To-Do list app that handles reminders well, it is perfect for my needs.",
"I just loved it, it helps a lot and you can implement your own organization system or prove others",
"works fantastic. effective and easy, lots of productive features. 2 thumbs up",
The widget feature is great. Everything can be done through that.,
"Good App does what it says, sometimes the inline text recognition dosen't work like it's suppost to be.",
I've used todoist for years. From time to time I've tried other systems but I keep coming back.,
The best and easy to use. Great widget. Very helpful for planning days,
"using this app with GTD method has changed my life. I am now more productive, more focus and less busy. thank you",
"It still says Todoist has stopped working ,was looking forward to the app,I'm very much disappointed.",
"Excellent! Does what it says on the tin, is easy to use and is definitely helping me keep track of everything I need to do",
"Even the free version is very useful! Great app, pretty clear design.",
"brilliant, simple and totally changed the productivity of my day to day life. 100% recommemd this app",
Great app. Simple and clean without sacrificing functionality.,
My husband and I are using this to stay organized through a move to a different city. It has worked out great!,
"Amazing, couldn't do without it! I use it for my personal to do lists/notes.",
I have been using this forever. The best app to get stuff done. I use it for my personal and work life. Kudos to the Todoist team!!!,
The tools that reminds me my todo list. Love sharing with my partner as well.,
"like being able to access my lists in different places, and that I can have multiple projects. I feel I'm getting more done",
"Super great app, drastically improve my productivity until the reminder feature was moved to premium... ‚òπÔ∏è",
All functionality comes with premium account only... Shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version,
"It works well, but please make it for free we can't enjoy the full app unless it's fully paid.",
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app,
Most simple and excellent solution for task and time management.,
Really love the app. As it keep me on time and improved my productivity too.,
"Love it, but definitely needs the ability to sign into multiple organizations.",
Difficult to add items and navigate,
Great Todo app that nearly and visually groups things .. found it incredibly useful and would recommend,
"the beat application which I use on a daily basis for more than 2 years. thank you todoist, team",
Great experience. Great Interface and excellent system of Notifications. Thanks,
"Easy to use, integrated well with other tools and very intuitive, great app",
Literally the best to-do app. SO WHY IS IT NOT CONNECTABLE WITH GOOGLE HOME? Singlehandedly ruins my use for it despite the fact it's simply better than every other list app out there.,
Without it I would be a lost and stressed professional... For me it's an investment for my mind's health,
"quick, easy to do list generator. easy to add, easy to reschedule.",
Great app. Too bad they're now nagging you in the app to rate and review them. Otherwise super useful.,
very complicated to use. can't make my own personal task by deleting the tasks already updated.,
"I love the app, help me to organize my whole life in a minimalistic way.",
It's been a while since I was this impressed by an app in such a short time. It's not even been a week! Amazing stuff guys!,
I really like this app but I wish it had the ability to set progress on each task.,
Everything I was looking for! Great way to track tasks and progress.,
Lol how dare you. Use Microsofts to do list instead everyone. This app charges you an insane amount for reminders. Greedy developers. Microsofts note application lets you do all you want including reminders and they do not ask you to fork them cash.,
I highly recommend this app if you have an ‚ú®attention disorder‚ú® it is wildly useful if you can find a way you like to use it!!,
"I love this app. This app makes my life easier, but i miss reminder feature in free version",
"Great app, super easy to use and keeps me organized with my college workload.",
Game changer. Best app I've used. recommended to many and one of the few apps I have happily paid for.,
"Recently upgraded to the paid version, and found it's even more helpful.",
Nice widget. Syncs across platforms well. Easy to use online as well.,
"Even the free version is awesome, i use this app everyday and it really helps me keep organized",
"ToDoist is a good thing but...did they really need to add the ""Karma"" function? I don't think so. I know how the actual concept of karma works. Life itself will ""punish"" you if you don't do the things you say you want to accomplish. If you don't have the drive right now to do something, maybe figure out why. The concept of Karma in an app, giving you more productivity guilt isn't going to motivate you either way in this case. I speak from deep personal experience.",
Reorganize my whole calendars tasks and keep in one place. @todoist app rocks for teams work and play!,
"Clean UI, ease of use, every functionality you need. Best todo list app ever",
My push notifications doesn't work promptly. I change my phone and then also its doesn't work,
this is a great app. simple & intuitive. just how i like it for productivity apps. thanks @ dev üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç also AD free which deserves more star!!!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,
Fantastic task tracking app. I've been using it for years and it keeps getting better.,
Simple easy to use not only helps with to-do lists but tracking your limits/habits ^^,
The full version allows you to do this. On the free version once you have completed a task you cannot see what it was.,
Great task management app but keeps crashing after updating a task or two.,
To do list app with lots of functions and integrations. One of the best,
Very very good app.. Free version is enough for small to medium companies..,
"Reminders, the MOST important feature, aren't included in the free version.",
outstanding fit making a task list. have been using this over my bullet journal and so far so good.,
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.,
"not exactly great for work, but perfect for civil life. has windows mac droid iphone apps. bit too simple for my taste.",
great app ! super easy to get into. the swiping function is very satisfying!,
"Nice app, i would recommend to anyone who wants to organize there day and get more done.",
I have tried many different to do apps and I haven't found any other that fits my needs as well as Todoist. Good job!,
Awesome productivity app. Filtering and tagging in the premium version are especially useful,

Perfect to do app. Integrates with my Google home. Thanks so much for this smooth slick app.,
Love this app üòç great switch. Such an easy app to use even with just the free features!,
"Useful features ask you to get premium version but when I try I get to this page, which is the app I already have installed. 1/5",
The app is great but atleast you could have added reminders in the free version.,
"So far, it's very useful for staying on top of my work tasks. I also appreciate the email reminders.",
"Good but I think this application can improve, for example i want to see total table with a calender",
"Very useful application, thanks! Could you please add tags grouping? Because I have created multiple different tags and now it is really mess!",
"awesome app to keep track of home, school, and work. I have it on my phone and my laptop and it's perfect.",
"Great app, with well thought out details. It has really helped me get a handle on all my tasks",
Free version is no use and I'm not paying for an app I can't try before I buy so I'm uninstalling. Sorry developers but not for me.,
More features now in the free layer. Basically all I need for a to-do app.,
Very simple and clean UI. So far would recommend to pretty much everyone,
Great product. Efficient and easy to use. Would recomment to anyone.,
"Great app! One of the best things about it is that you can run the app on Linux, iOS and Android, which works great for me.",
"Great app, I use it everyday!",
"Excellent application, I have been using it since 2013 with premium account.",
"Great app, it resolved half of my couple issues. I would definitely recommend it.",
Exceptional organization tool. Helps keep a bird's eye view of all open projects.,
It is goed better than I expected their windows app is bad but we all have a browser so that is not sometging bad.,
The first to-do list app that makes me wanna do stuff instead of making longer and longer lists,
Fantastic integration with Alexa. Any errant thought immediately makes it to my list.,
"Todoist is simple, customisable, and helpful app to get things done. Must have app for Productivity.",
Does exactly what I need it to do with an enjoyable ux/ui. Good integrations for my needs.,
"I liked this app because it has a computer version as well, however it's a shame you have to pay for reminders as that's what I need",
I love this app! It has made my life 100% more organized and helping me get things done.,
"Really great, but please add some more dark themes with different colors!",
This app is great for what it does. I just wish that reminders weren't a premium option.,
"Great app! Very easy to use, would highly reccomend. No ads or pop ups! :D",
"Very good app, smooth, organized, and functionality is amazing.",
"After extensive testing, the best one for me. I wonder if there is some easy way to create subtasks on mobile...",
Best to-do list app ever,

simple interface and programing to keep track of your task and organize your day.,
"great app. But, you have to purchase the premium to set a remainder for your task.",
"Updated review -- Todoist fixed the issues I had complained about, and is now a 5-star app for me. Thanks!",
Best tool I've found for staying organized and making progress on goals.,
"Dev's response resolved my query regarding auto-change of date from the use of keywords like ""yesterday"" or ""tomorrow"" in task Perfect to do list app",
This app is amazing! It's really helped me streamline my productivity! Definitely recommend.,
an excellent app for organising your life on the go...,
That's amazing.... I used this app in 2014 and today I just installed it again and it still remembers my tasks in 2014.,
I love the fact that it syncs between devices! Overall great app!,
Easy to use and reminds me via notifications and email. Keeps my life on track.,
Very clear interface and a nice priority system to section off the most important things.,
Starting to organize my work time better thanks to this app. Reminders are great!,
So useful! I love it! It's a load off my mind to have a recurring checklist!,
Why has the daily notification stopped outlining the tasks due for today and now instead is giving a useless supposedly motivational message?,
"The best to-do app, love it. Easily synchronizes across all my devices.",
puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly.,
"Best productivity app, clean interface. No paywall for removing ads.",
Amazing app that has helped me accomplish a ton of task and keep track of my life.,
"Some basic features that other app provide are paid features in this app. For example, reminder and labels",
Helpful for everyday to do lists. Easy to create different catagories.,
great time saving and organizing software. i use it every day.,

Lies are not good and if you play with my trust and the world trust you are not helping the world to be a better place you are helping to continue destroy I don't want to open no more apps I don‚Äôt trust what they say,

"had this app for about a year. it was perfect for what i needed it for at first, but now it's practically unuseable. sections and tasks randomly duplicate and can't be deleted without also deleting unrelated items. i tried updating my app, which didn't help at all. sad to see it go, but i use my calendar every day, and the frustration of dealing with these glitches is simply not worth it!",
"It's been three months and the app still stops syncing periodically. It just hangs, as does the widget. The only way to recover is to delete the app's local data. And their support email address listed in the Play Store is still the same one that they don't actually support. I think it's time to finally give up :(",
The app is not intuitive. Subtask feature is great. Very hard to edit a task once entered. It is easier to just delete the task and re-enter it than waste the time searching for the place to edit the task. It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to move a task from the inbox to the project it needed to be in.,
"Great app. I pay for the subscription because I find the app invaluable for creating structure in my life. However, there was a recent update that changed how reminders are set, and while I do like the new feature, I wish they didn't remove the old one that allowed you to type a specific reminder with your keyboard. For example, I used to be able to type in something like, ""every other Sunday at 8am"", but now I can only select a specific date and time unless I use Todoist on my PC.",
"This app is the best todo list app. I have used this for almost 5 years I think, and it's been great for me and my husband. A todo list cannot get better than this one. However, my life circumstances have changed. This only works when I can do things, not when I want to give jobs to others. I have a kid now, and there are the family schedule, individual member's schedules, plus important things to always have in hand (notes), etc. Thank you todoist and good bye. [Edit below] We've moved to Twist",
"Really helps me keep track of things, love the integration of ""natural language"" for scheduling dates and times. If I had one complaint/suggestions it would be to make reminder notifications more noticeable. I feel I miss my reminders a lot. However, it's a small issue. Todoist has every feature I wanted from a To Do app, and more than a few I didn't know I needed.",
"I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there. There has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months, especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks, and it's been a bit frustrating there. But overall, it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions. Give it a shot!",
"So far, it's great. Just a small suggestion though: In ""comments section"" of tasks, if there are multiple images posted, and I click one to view, I should then be able to view the next one by swiping left/right. Instead I have to click off the image I'm currently on and scroll down the list of comments to find the next one. This was not intuitive to me, because in most SMS apps, whenever you view an image someone has sent you, if you swipe to the left/right, it will scroll through all images.",
"Very clean, well organized to-do list app. It makes completing tasks feel rewarding with the 'karma' feature. The 'projects' feature really helps to organize large projects into more manageable, easy to schedule tasks, which helps you to complete the larger project easily. The only thing I dislike is the fact that the free version does not come with all of the features unlocked, but this app is still my favorite to use even without the extra features.",
"I rely on this app daily for all my personal to do lists. But recent changes to functionality have made it less friendly to use than when I first got it.  For example it's much harder to add a time. Whenever I add a time to a task, it assumes I want to do it today, and I have to go back in and change it back to the original day.   Another annoyance is I can never use the word ""march"" in a task (like the March for Science) because the app thinks I mean the month. There are other words that happens with too, I can't recall them all right now.  Also like another use I don't like the circles on the left to check off the tasks, I keep deleting them accidentally.",
"Awesome but not perfect. Best I've found so far, and I've tried a ton. With a lot of my workflow being email/outlook based, the plug-in is incredibly helpful. It's a little complex, but with great power comes a bit of learning curve. I have an Android phone, an iPad, and work in Windows so the cross platform nature is key for me. Missing a couple things I think are key like being able to enter a completed date in the past (yesterday at least). I'm getting far more done using the app.",
I love this app and I count on it to keep me organized but am not crazy about the latest update. I love that my list appears larger and easier to read but I don't like how it automatically deletes it when an item is hit. I've accidently lost items on my grocery list several times. It has left me feeling less secure that I've crossed everything off my list.,
"Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either. So, no backward search for the events, calendar sharing and other integrations. Well, task and project-wise, this is a powerhouse! Much more simple and well designed than Google Keep I've been using for years.",
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first.",
"It's a great app, but just like any organization app, you have to meet it halfway with actual effort. If you don't actually intend to complete the work, don't kid yourself by getting the app. I only wish it included a calendar that displayed events in chronological order along with the list of events in bullet point format and that it sent reminders of events. I'm very picky about apps, but this one is actually nice.",
"Best to do list I've found. I used to use Trello but it didn't work for me. This does everything Trello didn't. Love the Inbox and how i can access it from a widget on my phone with one press. Also i have the other widget that shows my list of choice. I love how you can schedule items just by typing when you want them, even if it repeats. It's a very smooth interface. A few of the premium features would be really nice to have. It's tempting but i don't like recurring fees. I'd rather pay once.",
"Very good to do list app! Looks nice, easy to create new tasks with the automatic detection of dates, times, priorities, and topic. Does not show ads and is pretty generous with the free version. My only issue so far has been occasional desync between devices (can be solved by logging out and logging back in). Also, note that the free version doesn't allow you to set reminders.",
"Seems like a pretty cool app, I like how quick it is to set up tasks. Would be great for some people's situations, but since I'm looking for something for personal use and have no need for additional projects, larger files (or files in general), or filters it is a waste of money to pay a monthly subscription just to be able to set up any reminders at all. Guess I'm back to my search for a good todo list app...",
"Mostly pros but one big con.. Absolutely love this app. It is really is user friendly and has helped me so much with organizing my life. One big con though is I had a big issue with the Google calendar integration. I had to disconnect it as it messed up my calendar and I lost a bunch of data that I needed to reenter. Luckily, it was uploaded to todoist so I didn't have to hunt for it. I really hope they fix that issue.",
"I've been using todoist for years now and it's nice being able to access my list from my phone or computer. Bad news is that with the latest update, the ""add task"" widget won't work. It said the app doesn't exist, so I tried to remove the widget and place it again, but it makes the Home UI crash every time. It did the same thing on my husband's phone.",
"Updated review to 4 stars from 1. The usability was very poor, but I looked online, and on youtube and eventually solved main problem. It was that when I made subtasks in Today view, they remained as original, but also in the new list as well (subtasked only there)! So I had a lot of duplicates. I stand by my earlier assertion that this is very poor usability from a new user's point of view. Also, I upgraded to premium and it is annoying that they charge 30 dollars up front (annual), instead of a reasonable monthly charge. However it is proving helpful and I look forward to future changes as well. Original review: Poorly designed, subtasks listed in a nonsensical manner. Doing basic things such as un-checking items a hassle.",
"I love this app! I've tried a few other task list type applications, but this one really takes the cake! Their format is very flexible and has all the basics offered for free...except reminders. Data syncs well across devices, you can create subprojects, stacked task lists, and many other useful features! I check Todoist throughout my day and it's working well for me so far. If you need reminders, check out their premium version! It has plenty of features that are actually worth paying for. ;)",
"Reliable, flexible, easy to use. I have more flexibility in organizing my to-do list the way I want to see it, and still use GTD. Only minor drawback: wish there was another way to set repeating tasks other than putting it into words. Putting it into words might seem easier than the menus seen om most other To Do apps, but you have to put the words in a precise way and even then it might still take a few tries before Todoist picks up the repeat request.",
"Simply brilliant. Everything you could want. Thoughtfulness is the word that comes to mind whenever I discover a new feature. Some awesome big features like location reminders and integrations, and tons of clever little features too. free version has a respectable collection of features that don't let you down, but I'm seriously considering getting the premium version.",
"this app has been great for keeping track of what I have to do each day. it conveniently syncs on all of my devices so it's always up to date no matter where I am and what device I'm using. it's easy and satisfying to mark something as ""complete"". it reminds you when you have overdue tasks, but gives you the option to quickly reschedule them to another time so you dont feel guilty. all in all, it's a great app that does exactly what it needs to do! highly recommended!",
"So I'm moving over to this app from TickTick because I like how it looks. I believe ticktick is more condusive to time management, but Todoist seems like the better overall to-do list app. The big problem I am having is stability. When trying to create a label within a to-do, it crashes. I've also experienced crashes when switching projects. I subscribed thinking the $8 extra would be a better experience, but so far I'm a bit concerned. I'll give the app a few weeks before giving up.",
"I recently moved from a job where I utilized Microsoft Outlook's tasks. I struggled to find an app that could perform as well as Outlook. This app does everything and more! On PC...I love the predictive typing, Google Chrome attachment, flagging emails, typing notes, attaching files, reminders, and more. And it syncs across all my devices. On the app I love how fluid it is. It is so easy to use! After trying literally almost every to do app out there, this one gets my five stars! I have tried Google Tasks, Microsoft tasks, Wunderlist, Any.do, and many more. I've even paid for a majority of them. This one is well worth the money!",
"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.",
"Love the minimalist nature of Todoist. It's exactly the right number of features. Inbox, projects, quick add tasks with keyword support - all great features that make the app quick and easy to use. Too many other to-do apps are overly complicated. This is by far the best one I've come across. (Free version, single user.)",
"It is a great to do app that takes a little while to find all the customization possibilities for, but when you do it works wonderfully, and even the free version is clean with no ads as I'm writing this. The biggest change I'd like to see is the ability to visualize progress through goals, daily tasks and overall projects in a more helpful way that shows the percent progress made in each priority level.",
"I had been looking for a to do list app with projects and connection to my calendar. There's a lot of stuff out there, but for some reason I fell in love with todoist. I saw it in a few YouTube videos and tried it out for myself and it has worked flawlessly. Two of my favorite features are projects and synchronization of my calendar and todoist on both sides. So if I add something to todoist, it gets added to my calendar and vice versa. Awesome, awesome utility!",
"Best GTD app. If you are building a list system based on David Allen's book getting things done, I think this is absolutely the best app to use for that. I have had GTD systems on Evernote, Onenote, Microsoft to do, and a paper notebook, and this is by far the best in almost every way. It's easy to use, has no bugs, has a bunch of great bells and whistles, and it syncs seamlessly across all platforms. The user experience is great too. It draws me in to my lists, rather than repelling me.",
"Taking off a star because I'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update. I'm not a fan of having to click the drop-down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once. Especially because the task selection mode expires each time I make a single change to the selected tasks, requiring me to then go into the drop-down menu again to and then re-select all of the tasks I just selected. I really liked before how I could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks. I know this change was made to allow easy re-ordering of tasks, although I don't find this particularly helpful because I don't typically re-order my tasks. I would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once.",
"Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.",
"After trying *so* many different time management apps (even the $200/yr ones), this one the best. I love that the date you type in the add task bar automatically assigns it to the date. You can set events, tasks, and reminders all with voice to text while driving! The only thing I'd *love* is a more conventional ""calendar"" view where I can easily see what's in store for the month with one glance. Keep up the good work!",
"The app looked very promising, but there were too many ""Upgrade to premium"" notifications when initially clicking through the app. From what I saw, I probably would have paid for a year if I was able to try out the fill app first. Instead, I got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications. For these reasons, 3 stars and lost buisness.",
"This app has improved my life so much. It's true that once I get the tasks written down, it clears my head for better management of the rest of my day/responsibilities. I can either make a list of things to do in general or assign tasks to certain days/times. I can make different lists for different projects. I REALLY ‚ù§Ô∏è the homescreen widget that I see whenever I check my phone. Some features you can choose to pay for, but the free version has enough features to do what I need. Never deleting!",
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!",
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.",
Perfect for organizing big life goals and daily tasks all in one. I've been using the pro version for 5 years now. I love how easy it is to organize tasks within one another and i use the scheduling features to their fullest extent. I use it on all my devices. Works well with small teams too. Now i never worry about losing an idea or missing a task. It's all written down forever and I never have to worry about what I forgot.,
"Love this app! It's easy to use, and once you get used to it, it gets even easier. It's the first app I've ever actually stuck to, because of its goal setting. It gives ""Karma"" points for successfully marking things off, and makes me want to stick with it. I emailed the developers with a question just one time, and they were quick and helpful with their response. The Premium version is worth every penny!",
"Incredibly convenient and simple, but I hope that the feature to attach photos (from your gallery or straight from your camera), links, and documents can be without the premium. Just a really naive wish, coming from a student. Other than that,  this app is really good, and its customer service is as admirable. Good job!",
"This is a great to-do app. The interface is easy to use and looks great. Natural language scheduling works really well. ToDoist is supported on a wide variety of platforms. This includes Android and IOS. I really like that there is a phone app and web browser access. You can share projects with other users. Things to note: if you want to schedule your day, you can set due dates and time but you are better served using a calendar app. ToDoist isn't well suited for recurring checklists.",
"This is by far the best tasking app out there. As someone who struggles with ADHD, this has been a lifesaver. It can sync with calendars, remind you of things based on location or time, and lots of other cool things. The interface is intuitive and tasks can be as simple or as detailed as needed. Additionally, it can work as a kanban board and be used among teams if needed. It works on and syncs across web, mobile, even my smart watch. Could not recommend more.",
This is a great system! I'm pretty disorganized so I'm of the opinion that if it works for me and the mess of my life that exists it must work for everybody. The only thing it needs is an inbuilt monthly calendar. PARTICULARLY for events/appointments. Also while I am aware that reminders are for premium only (and as such are not a factor for losing a star) i am slightly unsure whether or not the reminder works like an alarm system where it will buzz at the time that you have set for the event.,
"One of the most useful apps I've ever used. It has a charming, professional interface that takes to-do lists to another level. For someone whose life runs on systems, this is imperative to making sure my day gets done. It has saved me many times and offers some nice extra features with a premium subscription that is very helpful but possibly not necessary for everyone. I could go on but I'll just say try it and make your own conclusions.",
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? The old widget could do things the app couldn't, and can't. Give it back! Matters have improved, though - it's now easy to open the app from the new widget.",
"It's a fine task manager app, a little bit hard to get at first with the weird natural language based task creation, but if you're willing to put in the effort it's pretty intuitive. The one big deal breaker for me is that if you have a daily recurring task it becomes overdue at midnight. If you tap it complete after midnight, it completes it for the next day which ends up with you missing a day unless you remember to do it on your own or manually set the next recurrence to today.",
"I use this app everyday at work--it's a great app with lots of options for keeping tasks organized. However, the latest update seems to have introduced a bug. Sometimes, while adding sub-tasks to a task, the app will auto-complete everything. All sub-tasks will simultaneously mark themselves as completed, and the only way to undo it is to go back and uncheck them one by one. Sometimes the cursor will also skip to the ""Comments"" box while in the middle of writing a sub-task.",
"This app has helped me re-establish good habits, remember things when I couldn't afford to forget (very forgetful person) and conquer my procrastination bit by bit. The slightly gamified interface helps to make the app fun, and more personalized for me. I do wish it were a little more like a game, some level-ups and rewards wouldn't hurt. Overall, very useful and encouraging. Doesn't feel clingy or noisy.",
"This is my dream personal planning app. I love the design, it looks and feels great to use. It's simple and intuitive but also very powerful. There any plenty of ways to group tasks, and the filters are very powerful for viewing them however you want. And it's fully featured. It has collaboration, a great widget, and integrations with a lot of other apps, including Google Assistant.",
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.",
"A few days in and so far so good. Definitely has a few non-intuitive functions. Setting custom reminders is weird...a pop-up should just appear to select a date and time, but instead you type it in then it tries to interpret what you type, then you select it if it is right. Very convoluted. Finally found the task completion statistics. Its next to your profile icon/picture when clicking on the three horizontal lines top left. Small circle with squiggly arrow with some numbers next to it.",
"What is the point of a ""To Do"" list without reminders? Nope, you don't get a notification reminder unless you pay for premium, you can't even try it to see if it will work better than Microsoft To-Do (which can't stay running for anything). Without notifications/alarms I can make a ""To Do"" list using a notebook & pen or the paper calendar I have on my fridge! The whole point of searching for a useful app is to use modern features, like reminders/alarms & custom days, dates, & times.",
"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works.",
"To start, notifications shouldn't be a premium feature. The main reason I want a to-do list on my phone is so I can get more from it, including reminders. Second, even the free features didn't function as the guide said they would. I tried to add a recurring task for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as per the instructions, but it wouldn't even do that. Edit2: sent image confirming smart recog is on, but you can't screenshot with the keyboard on and cannot turn keyboard off while setting time.",
"Great to-do list app, I just wish the task widget was more responsive. It's a bit annoying to tap a task to check it off, it takes a second to actually check off, and then wait several more seconds for the list to refresh before you can interact with anything else. I primarily use the widget to interact with the app, so the way that functions is very important to me.",
"No easy way to view your completed tasks. Everything else about this app is great, but this one missing feature is a HUGE dealbreaker. For 90% of people, the benefit of a todo list is to see what you have done easily, and get a sense of achievement from it. If they added that feature I'd give it 5 stars, but I find this app unusable without this feature.",
The app itself is good but the voice integration on Android is not intuitive nor powerful. I have to jump through several hoops to get my task logged and it often ends up wrong. This might be an issue with Google as well. But I am looking for a quick way to get tasks logged when I can't type. Instead I find my self fumbling to press buttons again...,
"Hi, The app's interface and usability is pretty good. But the time zone feature has some bugs. If I set a different time zone on my device and a different one within the app, it causes problems. I was hoping that you guys could overcome those. It would help a lot of students stuck with asynchronous learning and online classes ü§íü•≤.",
"Great todo app with minimalistic UI, however there is a bit of missing potential. The app is fairly full of features, however for key things like notifications you aren't given many settings to customize them. Another example is you can't have tasks auto-scheduled based on the project it is in or the labels it has. I paid for a subscription (only $4) to test out labels and everything this app and the desktop version offered and I was a bit underwhelmed by the lack of automation features.",
"Easy to use. It takes a second to get used to controls but then it super easy. I use the widget to add task throughout the day. My list stays condensed in my notifications. Only when I click on it, does it show me everything on my list. I love this app because it helps me remember things, and helps me stay on track when I have a million things going at once (I'm a Mom, Wife and Student).",
"Overall, the interface is just ok. It's difficult to sometimes figure out where to type things to add the event to your list and changing the date on an event can be annoying as well. Then you have to pay to even set a reminder alarm... But it functions well and is a fairly straightforward layout.",
It does what it needs to. I just wish instead of email notifications when things were over due that I would get push notifications instead. I think it is hard to balance having a free tool and a paid version for something like this and the free version gives you the bare minimum. I dont know how the paid version would provide me with any better service as an individual than the free version aside from push notifications.,
Love this app! started with the free version and upgraded right away. It really helped me get my life and schedule under control when I started my business. I am still learning some of the more advanced ways to use it and find it gets more and more helpful with time. I love that i can send emails directly to it and make them into tasks and also i totally get into tracking my progress and getting points! im a geek like that LoL,
"I have been on a mission to find a to-do list that syncs well between my phone, smartwatch, and google calendar. I have tried just about every to-do list out there and in some aspect, every single one of them fell short. I was about to give up hope when I came upon this app! Thanks to this app, I am now the organized and productive person that I always knew I could be but never could find the right tool to make it happen!! Thank you!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
"I love the app. I just wish there was an option for a one time payment for premium. I have too many subscriptions, and I always cancel new subscriptions in a short amount of time because I find that I don't use the app enough to pay monthly or yearly. The apps that I can pay once for premium are the apps I usually stick with. I use this a lot for tracking my spending and budget, so a subscription is kind of counter intuitive.",
"I am a fan of GTD which is really just a system of lists. I have tried all the big name task managers out there. Todoist is by far my favorite. Once you catch on to the natural language processing it is so easy to record everything that comes to mind in the ""In"" box then do a review later to decide what to do. Since I always have my phone I use the notification bar icon to record stuff as I think of it. Nothing ever gets lost or forgotten. It is wondeful to have a septem you can depend on!",
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it.",
"Truly my favorite to-do list app I've ever tried. My one small quibble is that it always has trouble accepting multiple keywords, for example if it's Monday and I need to set up an items that is weekly on Tuesdays, I can't just type ""Tuesday weekly"" but have to go tinker around in the settings. I'd also like more customization over the look, with fonts and colors.",
"I really like this app and use it everyday. However, these new Pop Ups that come out of nowhere congratulating me on checking off tasks are incredibly annoying. I don't need a digital pat on the back. Maybe some people like that and that's great. Personally, I just want to keep checking off tasks or looking at what's next to do and these pop ups just get in the way of that and irritate me. Can you please make it so I can turn them off? I've searched the settings and I can't find it anywhere.",
"Newest update completely renders filters and upcoming useless. Just a white screen. Testing before launching changes obviously didn't happen. Edit: the newest update renders the app functional. However, it is still very glitchy. Upon selecting filters, the view is not updated until you scroll the screen. And filter names are truncated to 2 or 3 letters.",
"The perfect todo app. It's so easy and quick to set up really powerful filters and workflows to make sure you're focusing on the tasks that matter most. Not to mention the performance and UX is super snappy, so you can note, organize, and check off tasks without wasting time you could spend getting things done fumbling with the app.",
"This little app got me through my finals this quarter. The simplicity and variety of scheduling options makes it very useful. At first I thought premium was dumb and I wouldn't need it, but they offered a free 30 day trial without having to add my credit card and I quickly got addicted. Once the 30 day trial was over I couldn't go back so I paid the 36$ year which I would say is extremely reasonably priced. Very recommended, especially for school. Helped me stay on track and never miss any hmwk",
"It's good, but the layout requires an extra click to get to the calendar week view, and that's my favorite view because I want todoist to be my weekly planner. If I have to click into the app, click the side bar, and then click into the calendar view, it's too much work. Those three views (today, calendar view, etc) I would like clickable like at the bottom always, or the ability to swipe between the views.",
"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget. These are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule. The widget could be improved, otherwise the app is great.",
"Fantastic app. I needed something like this to improve my productivity with reminders for work, and this app delivers more with cool features like projects, tags, priorities, comments, and so much more. The smart-typing and interpretation of text is amazing to set specific dates and tags just by typing, it really speeds up the process of creating tasks, which makes it easier to use and way more functional. I highly recommend the app, and the unlocked subscription fee is incredibly reasonable!",
"This app is easy to learn and use, and yet so powerful. It has been extremely robust and supports every common desktop and mobile platform. Adding a task with natural language scheduling is such a breeze! It also supports queries to view your tasks in many different ways. The free version is complete and usable, with no ads! But I'm seriously considering upgrading to pro just to support these developers. It takes a lot of skill and dedication to make an app this robust and well designed.",
"I used Apple Reminders for a while until I switched ecosystems. You have to pay to get the most out of it, but it's worth it to me. Excellent integration with Google Calendar and it works on all my platforms (Windows, Android, and Chromebook). Helps out a lot. Not the best voice assistant integration, but still great!",
"So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.",
"Over time I've tried a lot of to-do list apps. Todoist has long been one I've come back to over and over and finally, I've settled on it as my favorite. During the past few years Todoist has helped me stay focused to grow my freelance business. It's also helped me when I get anxious and overwhelmed. I can easily set my daily list to just a few manageable tasks and move things to the back burner or ""inbox"". I love Todoist and its Getting Things Done methodology.",
"Very positive so far. Installed the app about a week ago and it took a couple of days before I felt entirely comfortable with it. The learning curve is very modest overall, it's one the few to-do list applications that's truly multiplatform. It have it installed on my iPad, Windows PC and Android phone (OK already! I kno6, and so far it has performed brilliantly. I'll update this eval if I run into any issues. but so far so good. Highly recommended...",
A little difficult to get the hang of. But all in all a great app. Only issue I'm having is that my recurring subtasks show up twice on my daily checklist which clutters up the list. The duplicates also appear outside the main task so I can't unexpand them to clear up the clutter. Other than that everything works well so far.,
There are so many to do apps out there and so many comparison articles it was difficult to even choose one. I tried several and this one definitely seemed like the best so I purchased the premium version and it is great. Save yourself some time and aggravation just get this one. Try the free version first. The premium cost is $3 per month subscription bille yearly for $36 and although there is no free trial of the premium version you do have 30 days for a refund if you don't like it but you will.,
"Awesome App overall. I like how you can create separate lists for different categories. However I'd appreciate if the subtasks could be reworked to allow for the main tasks and the subtasks to be marked as completed separately. The reason I use subtasks in the first place is because they're related to my main task, yet I need to complete them at different times than the main task. Right now if I mark one as complete, the whole thing is marked as complete, which defeats the purpose.",
"Very fun and intuitive app! Completing a task is rewarding, and the app is very good at notifying me of my tasks for the day. It is also great at organizing my tasks, and I love the option of adding a task to the Inbox - a great way to still add something without the immediate need to file it under a category. One issue I have is on Wear OS: on my Fossil Gen 6 (Wear OS 2), scrolling with the rotating crown causes a frenzy of vibration and the app to freeze. Please fix this!",
"I got lucky that this is the first to-do list app I have ever used. It is excellent in every way! It allows you to add items, prioritize items, move items around on your list, categorize items, and has multiple inboxes all with the free version. More options are available for the premium version if you need them.",
"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that.",
"I adore this app. I type in everything I need to get done, then sort it all by date and priority. At the beginning of the day, I pick three tasks to rate as priority one. At the end of the day, I can easily postpone tasks I didn't accomplish without feeling bad. I feel organized, and like I can finally tackle my seemingly endless to-do list in a logical manner.",
Its good. WAY better than when I first tried it. The features are excellent. Esp because I use it mainlie for life stuff and to get the functionality it offers most productivity apps make you pay a per user fee. I've tried about 9 in the past year and a half so im prettie confident in the quality of Todoist. Runner up Asana as a for instance doesn't automatically remove completed tasks on their free version... bananas.,
"So-so app. The way to move a task to a different Project from the search results is obscure ‚Äî as described in the developer's response here, it requires scrolling a list that shows no visible indication it can be scrolled. In other contexts, swiping the task right provides a Move option; but, as is common with Microsoft, the way to move a task in the search results doesn't match how it works in other contexts, and isn't obvious at all.",
"I recently completed the forced upgrade for the app, and now it doesn't work consistently.....repeatedly, the app has frozen up completely and none of my tasks appear. If I'm able to get it working again (aftet multiple restarts), all the changes i made in recent sessions are gone. It worked perfectly before. I'm SO annoyed! I've been a todoist user for years, but if this isn't fixed, I'll switch to something that works consistently (already made that switch, for work projects).",
"Absolutely love this app because this is a digital version of how I've always organically done it. Can assign things to projects or labels. Have due dates and repeating events but also no dates if you want! Love how the website/desktop version is so similar to the app that navigating between the two is a breeze In terms of minor changes I'd like to be able to repeat but ""every other day"" or ""every monday, Tuesday, and Thursday"" for semi regular events/chores/tasks. Overall 10/10",
"I'm an OCD business owner and this app is perfect for me. If you want clean widgets on your home screen for quick and easy tasks and goal setting this app beats all the others. I personally wasted 12 hours researching and playing around with the task and to do apps and these guys take the cake. Great UI, great customizability, not too try hard. I love how you can create lists for different things and set different categories on the same list so you don't have to hit back when swapping lists.",
"You don't have to pay for Todoist for it to be useful. At its core it is a digital to do list with flexibility for whatever you want to throw at it. You can schedule recurring routines easily, break down large projects into smaller subtasks and organize it all to your liking. I use Todoist as a big picture planner. The desktop program is what I use for weekly planning and task input. But when I'm out in the world making it happen the phone app is just as valuable. I say give it a try!",
Prepare to pay. It looks like a very useful app if you pay for it. The basic features I have access to for free are good; easy to use & had a nice front end user experience. I can't give 5 stars because I'm not going to pay to access the extra features when I can use Samsung Notes for free for the same basic abilities. I don't need it bad enough to pay.,
"The repeat option is nonexist. The only time its allowed me to repeat a task is ""every month"". At first I thought ""every two weeks"" might be too confusing for it but I tried ""every week"" and ""every day"" and it doesn't pop up except for that first day. Also the fact that it often lists the scheduled date as ""today"" despite me not yet picking a date is stupid, and it resets to ""today"" automatically when I try to edit the task in any way (like change the name). It doesn't make any sense!",
"Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.",
"I really like this app and the smart tags feature of being able to tag it on a project which is super quick. You can also use boards like in Trello. A lot of really great functionality in this app. The only issues I've had is syncing between desktop app and phone a few times, but once I logged out and back in on app it synced my tasks so hopefully that will get fixed soon. I haven't tried doing that again, but I will soon.",
"Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!",
This thing just keeps getting better and better. These guys are doing great. I loved the google calendar integration and discovered to my delight today that since its inception it has been improved on and I can now add a separate calendar integration per list for those few lists that need it. Sync is instant and oh so helpful. Thanks a lot guys!,
"My experience has been hit or miss. After listening to the developer on the YNAB podcast recently, with my new role in IT as a Solutions Architect, there is immense value in a proper organization and to do list application, especially task boards. Paid for premium. Unfortunately, when clicking a label in the left nav in favorites, it does nothing and you're still left viewing the Inbox, Today or Upcoming pane you were in. It doesn't filter or behave as it should. Edit: I was doing it wrong!",
Pros: Can add two levels of subtasks to tasks. Four priority levels. Can drag tasks up and down to prioritize them further. Any number of color coded custom labels can be added to each task. Dark theme available. Cons: NO reminders without paying every month which is pretty bad. I understand charging for premium features but reminders on a task manager is one of the most basic features possible. Can't find a way to backup. *Also: stop deleting my reviews...,
Genuinely out of this world. This app goes above and beyond in creating a seamless organising system that really allows you to get your mind off and scribble as many thoughts as possible and then organise them. And it tracks it perfectly. It syncs with the PC version excellently and rewards you for every task done making you feel the progress and it gives you many metrics to further illustrate how much you've done in a short period of time. One of the best out there üëç,
I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.,
"It's okay. I thought it would be much better for tracking recurring tasks. Once you miss a task, it just says overdue. Even if it happens multiple times a day, you won't be getting reminded again. Not worth paying for pro with notifications if this is how it works. I paid for a year but I won't be renewing if this doesn't change.",
"Awesome! Best of all worlds. Inbox for ideas that doesn't clutter priority items to get done. Easy scheduling and projects with multiple layers of sub projects. Easy to hide sub projects and assign to different days. Easy to tag, prioritize, sort, etc. In the past, I would use a list, it would get cluttered and overwhelming, then I would start a whole new list in defeat. With Todoist, I actually get to the end of my list, before the end of the day.",
I almost went with TickTick because of the calendar within the app and the habits feature. But in the end I just couldn't pass up the level of organization that Todoist offers. I have ADHD and I really need visuals to get through my days. This app seems to work well with how I think. I feel good at the end of the day when I can clear out my tasks. The integration with Google calendar is useful for planning my days. I will most likely pay for premium.,
"I'm not 100% happy with how it's set up, but it's working well enough to help keep me organized. Since it's a web based app, I can still access my info when my phone acts up, and I won't lose all my data again the next time my phone craps out and I have to do a factory reset. My main complaint is that it doesn't work exactly the same as the other app that I'm already used to, but that one didn't reliably back up and I lost my data one too many times. I'll get used to this one.",
"Todoist is an excellent app with excellent support. I use Todoist to help stay on top of the flow of information coming at me, have and also utilized the repeating task function for regular checklist items. I also love using the labels for contextual tasks, like emails, calls, errands, at home, at computer, etc. It's been a game changer in my ability to be productive and efficient. Todoist support is awesome, too. If you're looking to become more productive and retain a sense of control over the things you are (and are not) doing, HIGHLY recommend this app! I also recommend reading GTD.",
"Worthless app. Have been using the premium version for 6 months now, and much preferred the previous free version from over a year ago that had the auto reschedule function in case you actually try to intentionally write down more than you can accomplish in a day to make sure things don't fall through the crack. Wish I had known thay feature was removed before purchasing, but without it, it's actually more work than just writing it as a simple checklist.",
"Very handy app. They are tons of tips and tutorials about how to get it to practically sit up and roll over. Really does help with productivity. Works with Alexa for the most part too. Updated now that I've used it for a while. I have the Pro version now, and it's very handy, especially for looking back at completed tasks. I know there are lots of tricks I don't know yet, but I do recommend this product.",
"It is an effective todo app with some unique and useful features. Paying $3/month for the premium subscription might be worth it...I'm still deciding on this app vs Wunderlist, the one I've used previously. Predictive typing for things like ""by today at 5pm"" is great but the free version has limited capabilities with reminders. Happily, no ads. It works nice between multiple platforms which is essential, especially since you can key things in on the PC VERY quickly. Karma points help motivate.",
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",
