"This app used to be a fun, enjoyable messaging app for kids, but now there are lots of bugs and it is very glitchy. The layout isn't fun as it used to be, and you can't change your color from blue. Also notifications! Big problem. I opened my app today for the first time in months and I have a message from my friend from a month ago. As soon as my app loads, the notification sound plays. It doesn't notify me of ANYTHING unless I open the app. Needs to be fixed.",
"Does allow me to add friends or family, gives an error. Keeps logging out and giving errors when trying to log in Request one-time password. It either doesn't work or doesn't get sent There is 0 help or customer service. You can go on the help link, but it's like typing into the abyss, no email verification it was sent, received, no follow up,nothing, you just are left hoping someone read it and you keep trying, hoping it works next time For a kids' app,it's very frustrating, to say the least.",
"I love messenger kids, but lately it's been really really glitchy. Can someone please work on fixing the bugs? Specifically, when somebody sends me a bunch of photos at once, no matter which one I click on, it only shows me the first photo they sent. It makes it really hard to see photos. Also something that's really bothering me is that certain people's profile pictures go blank, and won't show up, which is confusing, because everybody looks the same. Thanks for whoever is reading this",
"This app is good, or WAS good. Starting today, it says 'unable to send' on EVERYTHING I try and type to my cousin. Same happens with pictures, videos, and voice messages. Also, for both me and my cousin, we only have the options to 'chat' or 'take a picture' in a call. The other ones like 'filters' or 'emojis' are greyed out and when we click either of them it does nothing. Please fix both of these problems or I might give 1 star after a while. Also please add a 'share screen' option. Thanks.",
"Incredibly helpful and useful app for communicating with your kids and keeping tabs on who they're talking to. One feature i really appreciate is that it will block potentially risky photos without any needed intervention. My kids have this tendency to run around without any clothes on and didn't think anything of taking some pics to send to a friend like that. Because the picture was automatically blocked, i didn't need to worry.",
"My daughter and I use this app to communicate. Whenever she sends me videos, I am able to see the first like 3 seconds, then it stops loading and will not show any more. I have so many videos she has sent to me that I can not see. I can hear voice messages but not videos. After 2 days, we can not see pictures that we have sent to each other. They won't load. PLEASE FIX! Also, a lot of the filters will not work. We can't tap on them and change the filter to whatever it says we should.",
"I think this app is awesome and it helped me connect and reunite with a friend I haven't seen in a while but the only issue(s) I have are that it takes so long to just connect to a call let alone only then starting to actually call the person after like 2 minutes of waiting. I am also experiencing issues as to why we cant type too long of texts. I think users should be able to write long paragraphs instead of having to do separate texts if one is too long. The last issue I'm having is with the voice messages, you see, the person that I am communicating with could have the absolute best wifi in the world and I could too but the voice chats are extremely glitchy, laggy, choppy, and sometimes freeze. But overall this a mediocre app. My parents also like the fact that they can track my activity! Maybe if you just try to make the network a little more stable and fix some bugs and issues it'll be five stars in no time but for now that's all I have to say. (But still an amazing app)",
"The app is great! Its very, very rarely laggy, and messages travel fast. But I would like to suggest some features, 1 when you type an emoji like this :) it comes out like this üôÇ, so it would be nice if there was a setting in your profile where you could turn it off. And 2, it would be nice you you could share your screen in a video call, for example if you wanted to show someone something funny or cool that happend in a game you could call them and show them without having to screen record.",
"Messenger Kids is great overall, though there are problems. I can chat with my friends just fine. But, sometimes when you send alot of photos at once it lags. You also cannot screen record(in a call), which is a bummer. One last thing: when you type something like :) it comes out like üôÇ. Can there be a button that can turn this off? Thank you, please solve these problems!",
"I downloaded the app to be able to message back and forth with my granddaughter. While the basis app is fine for her, I would prefer a few more customizable options. For example, having some hearing loss, the app provided notification sound is difficult to hear. I've tried numerous times to change the default sound, but it keeps reverting back to the original app sound.",
"I really like that messages can't be deleted so I can monitor budding social skills. I like the age appropriate stickers and simple helps for kids just getting started with social media. It's a good intro to using tech for communication and basic keyboarding, and a great incentive for reading and spelling practice! It's obviously designed for parents to install on a child's device, but I don't want my 8yo having his own devices yet. It would be nice to have the versatility to let him send the pictures he takes without having access to all the pictures in my photo gallery. As it is, I can't allow him to use the camera feature at all. Or the microphone, since I'd rather he call his friends on the phone for free than use up a ton of data on the chat feature. It would also be nice to change the ring tone somehow. Right now it's the same as the default notifications on my phone so it sounds the same as system updates and calendar notifications and everything else.",
"Nice app. I do wish there were more options in the drawing thing. Stuff like an entire color palette to choose from instead of limited colors. A paint bucket tool, and a way to zoom in and out on your drawing. Also with profile pictures you gotta take a picture right then and there, you cant pick one from your gallery. Other than that I recommend this. Gave a good day",
"This app is amazing and it's fun! Easy for kids to communicate with friends and family. The reason with the 4 stars is sleep mode, when I'm in a video call with my friends it auto hangs up which is annoying. And when messenger re-enables in the morning at 8:00 am it won't let me send messages because of the sleep mode, and so I have to wait until 9:00 am for it to calibrate properly. Get rid of the sleep mode plz! Could've given it 5 stars if it didn't have a sleep mode.",
"Pretty good app overall, but I have an issue that's REALLY been bugging me. The video playback. It's not bad for videos that had been sent recently, but I tried to play videos that had been sent a few months back and they wouldn't play. They just had the little loading symbol. I waited for TEN MINUTES and it didn't load, and I tried many times. Very frustrating, please fix this. üôÅ",
"I am a child using this app, and I think it is good for younger kids. It's not really ideal for older children, (teens, adults) but it's really good for parents concerned about what their child is texting. Parents can change settings, like making the child unable to see links (to maybe innopropriate sites) and they can also decline random people from being able to text their child. Personally, I switched over to texting normally just for privacy reasons. Very good app!",
"This is a really good app to call friends or family in. Although there are a few things I don't like, like how it's so hard to figure out how to change your profile photo, because I just learned how. Another thing I want is to be able to get rid of that screeching ringtone and at least let us use premade ringtones or a video from our tablet/phone. Overall, 8 out of 10.",
"This is a great app!!! There is only two things I do not like.1. My friend has an iPhone and she can overlay music on her videos. I have an Android and I can't do that.2. The new update is nice, I just wish there was more colors to choose from, and it would be AWESOME if there was something that put designs or colors in the back ground. Other than that, I love it!!!!!!!!!",
"Amazing, I love how you can customize profiles and stuff! But there's an annoying glitch. I would love to give 5 stats however, my best friend was calling me, and then. Of course! The audio shuts off, she wears headphones, her mic was on, and then all I could hear was background noise and her mom talking! It's horrible, doesn't happen to anyone else. I don't know why you haven't fixed it either, and anyways bye. Thanks.",
"It's not too bad. I can text and call my cousin and friend, but one thing I find ridiculous is that you can't delete messages and everytime you type a keyboard face (example: :P) it changes into an emoji. Also, sometimes when I try to open a contact, it takes me to video call even though my finger wasn't on the video call button. Please fix this. Overall, it was an okay experience.",
"I really like the app, but I have been having a lot of problems. Number 1. for some reason it is not letting me take pictures. every time I click a filter it just disapears. 2. every time I try and call someone my whole screen turns black and I can not see anything. 3. my friend loves the videos I made in the past with the make a song thing, but she does not have that option and it is always lagging when I take the vid. 4. for some reason it is making my app small so I can not see the contacts.",
"It's ok. It gives me ridiculous notifications! it never alerts me when my friend text me and only alerts me when my parents are online, which is very annoying. The split screen idea is ok, I prefer duos setup of the screen. The texting your friend during a call is amazing! I love that feature. All in all it could use some work. But it's good right now, fix these please.",
"This is a really good app. It's fun and I like the fact that you can send pictures, videos, and gifs. The filters are cool, and wish you could like favorite them so you could always have certain filters even when it went away. But it kinda sucks that you would have to block someone if you want them to stop messaging. There should be a setting where there's a limit of the amount of text send at one period. And it does require wifi. That sucks because you couldn't text at certain places well g'bye",
"This app is awesome the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the updates are only for IPhones which I don't have. I like how the new update looks. Also you can't delete pictures or videos once you save, them which takes up a lot of storage. But the video chatting has games and filters, the camera has filters, you can save pictures, and play games and have a profile picture.",
I love using this app to be able to talk to my friends. Especially since COVID because we havent been able to see eachother as much. One problem that only happens to me mostly is that my app doesnt get the updates as quick. It will normally get it around 2 days after or one day. Also I would like to be able to choose a profile picture from my gallery. I also dont always get notifications when somebody calls or messages me. If you could fix this that would be great!,
"This app is so fun!! I use it almost every day! I would recommend allowing access to more content, so far looks pretty good! The internet sometimes glitches out on the calls, it would be very helpful to have better internet. And, sometimes it glitches so bad that your device dies. Please At least consider having two or more different internets before downloading, but overall that is good! and I have one more thing. So, sometimes I will see my friends making music videos? and I try to make them too, but I don't have access to be able to make that. So please give that access to everyone, but overall this is an amazing app! keep up the hard work!!! (one more thing this takes up a LOT of storage!)",
"This is amazing! You can see who your kid talked to the past day and see their contacts which makes it safe for my kids and other kids as well! I like how I choose whether or not they can add someone. However, there is a slight problem. My child loves to use filters but when it says ""tap"" she taps and nothing happens. This is common with some of her friends too and I'd appreciate it if you could possibly fix it. Thank you and Great App!",
"I love using this app to talk to my family. But there are a few problems I've experienced, 1 is sometimes when someone calls me and I awnser, it will be a black screen, and I can't hear or see anything. It's very creepy. 2 it hangs up itself, very annoying. Also a few things I think would make this app better is screen sharing, it would make it easier to show someone something that way. But it is a great app over all! Please fix these issues thanks!",
"It's a very good app for calling and texting, yet I have one issue with it. When I'm calling with my friends, my screen tends to black out temporarily and I am unable to interact with anything until the screen turns back on. There's no warning to this. It only happens when I call with messenger kids, as other texting apps don't have this glitch. Otherwise, great app!",
"Great app! I love texting and calling my friends over quarantine and all the cool filters. Although I have a few suggestions. For one, I like to video chat my friends, but sometimes I wish I could just call with out video. Also, maybe have polls about whether a filter can leave or stay, or about choosing which one should be a new one. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints. I suggest it to some friends of mine, and a few actually joined because of me! Great work!!",
This app is great but sometimes when I FaceTime my friends it freezes. Besides that it's a great way to communicate with your friends and visit. I go on Messenger kids like 3 times a day cause it's so much fun! There is so many different effects you can use to have fun and take funny photos and send to your friends. Also if you go to the top of your screen and go to play a drawing game there are 3 options that you can choose from to draw and you send what you draw so your friends can guess.,
"This is a great resource. However, it disconnects and glitches all the time. Here are some ways I've found to fix the issue of texts not sending or calls not connecting: 1: Try turning off wifi and closing down the app, then turn wifi back on and open the app. 2: Try calling the person your texts are not sending to or your calls are not connecting to. Stop the call almost right after you start it. If you still can't connect, it may be the other person's connection.",
"Best app ever! The best messenger for kids! Amazing job creators! But a few issues are occuring with my friend and I. She can't hear me through the device, and before you say it's because of the devices we use, it's not. We both have amazing quality tablets, but this still happens. And with her other friend, sometimes it hangs up on its own when no one pressed the button. I love the features, one of my favorite ones are the games we can play on call! Amazing! Thank you so much! :) :DüòÑüòÄ‚ò∫Ô∏è yay!!",
pretty good but a few things to adjust. 1. saving videos. If I want to save a funny video then let me save it! 2. you can't send a lot of pics at once so plz fix that. 3. screen share. for example if you want to show a new game you installed. 4. for some reason I used to have a lot of songs that were popular and clean but now I only have little kid songs for the sing to a song filter. ty that's all I have,
"This app is great overall, and it lets me contact my friends, but it has some issues that definitely need to be fixed. With my one friend, I've sent 4 messages to them and it only says 'sent' it has been this way since February and I have updated the app multiple times, and I have all notifications on and it won't ever send me a notification when a message comes through, so I have to check it regularly. If you could fix these issues, I would definitely appreciate it.üôÇ",
"My friends can edit and add music to their videos but I can't. I tried to delete the app, update it and see the version, but it didn't work. My friends can also see me when they go off the app but I can't see them when I go off the app. But I still love the app because I can chat with my friends. There are also lags. I'm on call with a friend and then both our screens go black to each other and we can't hear one and other.",
"Great app! I'm very impressed. I thought this app when I got it would be bad, and have bad audio but no! There are just a few problems.. first of all, sometimes when your on a call it glitches out really bad and you can barely hear the person your talking to. Second of all when your playing a game and your on a call it glitches and the call ends So please fix these problems! I would really appreciate it. But overall it's a very good app me and my friends and family love it. Thank you.",
"I love this app. It is such a safe way to communicate with others. You can call, facetime, text, send voice clips all in one app. Only thing is how you cant pick a photo from your gallery for your profile picture. However, this app is safe, and does a very nice job helping kids start conversations and keeping it up to date! You can have multiple acounts for your kids and easily switvh beteween them. And, best of all, your kid can't do anything bad because you see everything they write and do!",
"Messenger Kids = good app. I can text with my cousins who don't have phones. It has a few problems, and after the latest update, my phone has been on mute and the sound is off, and it still makes noise. I might have my sound off for a reason, then I probably want it to be quiet when I send a message. Please change it back. My cousins feel the same way. Another thing I have a problem with is the profile pictures. It won't let me use pictures from my gallery. Other than that, It's a good app. üòä",
"This app is really good. There are a few problems though. On the ""Sing a song"" game, if you sing to it or dance to it, the lipping is off and the beat is different. The next thing, my mom can't add people now. It says I am able to choose my own contacts but it won't let me. And the last thing. I would really enjoy the app more if I could choose a profile picture from my gallery. I used to have an iPhone and I could do it on that. But not on android phones.PLEASE FIX ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS!",
AMAZING APP! Except a few things just recently when you call each other if you want to filters you would be able to play little games with each other but since pretty much October they are all gone and sometimes when you call some body screen is black and you have to hang up and call back in a second and the last thing is sometimes somebody's filters are not working they do not show up on your face when you click on them that is it other the that it is a great app.,
"Overall useful and easy for kids to navigate. The screen orientation drives me crazy. My kids tablet is typically landscape orientation because of the case. But when we have it that way, the other person is sideways. It doesn't flip with the tablet. His screen does, but not the other person's side of the screen. Frustrating. Otherwise love this app because my boys don't have to steal my phone to call family members/friends :) they love chatting with them frequently.",
It let's me talk to my friends and have fun silly faces! Super Awesome! Totally recommend. There are a few glitches. One is where you can't touch the screen in calls. Another is you don't get notifications when people text you. Please fix! Overall it's a great app and I'm pleased!!! üòÅ,
"Pretty good, but sometimes it is glitchy like when someone calls it takes a few minutes to show, and notifications don't always go off even when there on but those are normal for most apps so I won't complain. And lastly when changing your profile pic, it doesn't go the first time it takes hours before it shows. And my friends have this problem too. But besides that pretty good just please fix these problems and add more filters and games and I'll give it 5üåü. But ty for being a good app. üòäüòÅ",
"This app is very nice to use for video chatting and texting, I would like some minor bug fixes and an update where you can share your screen because it would be very nice so they can show things easier. Of course this is a website and is secured for kids and showing the screen is kind of strange it would be much nicer. I'd also like an extention where you can record your conversation with being able to hear yourself and the other person. Thank you for reading this! :) -Aesthetic Duo RBLX",
"This kids messaging app is overall amazing and I've only had a few issues in the past year or so. First off, when you call someone, sometimes it will be a black screen or you wont be able to hear them. I'm not sure if this is something wrong with my phone or the app in general. Another thing is about the colors that came with the new update. Us android user do not have the option to change the colors. Thanks for reading.",
"Something is wrong with this app. My kids had the app, but when they logged out, they could not log back in. Every time I log in, it keeps going back to the log in page and authorize this device. I tried it in different phones and accounts, but the app was not working at all. I thought that I am the only one who has this issue, but most of my friends also were having this issue. Also, a few people who wrote reviews (see below) were having the same issue. Very frustrating!",
"it keeps throwing me off of calls but other then that it is really good. Plus, my friends say there are buttons on their screen that can make certain videos, and mine and my other friends does not. On this button, you can edit videos and put music in them. I heard about this from my friend that has it, and I am not sure if this is a new update, but this is certainly annoying because I want to do it, too.",
"Its a great app for kids to keep in contact with family and friends. But I found it rather difficult adding my child's classmates that he was close friends with. Sending my child to school with a 4 or 5 word goofy phrase was impossible for him to remember. So I had to find a way to search for his friends parents on fb and contact them that way. Its awkward and rarely works. That shows the plus side of security of the app, so top notch on security in my opinion, which outweighs the cons.",
"I use this app often because it is the only way to contact my family, but I have a few concerns. Sometimes it doesn't notify me if I get a text, I can't pick a ringtone when someone calls me, sometimes when I call someone I can't see them even though I have great internet, I can't delete texts and I can't save videos, and the worst part is this app is taking up 3.7 FRICKIN' GB! Please fix these problems or you will lose a star.",
"I really like this app so far. It's easy for my 3 year old to use and easy so far for me to monitor every conversation. The app is completely free and my kid is able to talk to only her friend and family. I definitely have and would recommend this app to anyone. Best part is there's no ads, I get to see all of my kid's conversations, and every picture received, sent, or deleted.",
"I do like this app, it is really fun, but two problems, 1. Whenever I try to update my profile photo, if it's one I've taken with my phone camera, it will randomly rotate the photo in one direction or the other. 2. It would be very efficient to have a computer version, keeping all the contacts and things with your other devices, only difference is that it is on computer. I do in fact understand this is meant to be portable contact on the go, but still. 3/5 stars, once what I've listed are updated/fixed, 5/5 would, recommend either way.",
"Its a fun way to conect, but it gets glitchy, and the game frustrates me because it's really slow. Filters and extra little games are really fun, there's just not a lot of them. Edit: they added way more games to play, and I spend a lot of time on this. It's really fun, and there is new filters ver often. It's a great fun way to connect, this should get 5 stars",
"I absolutely love this app! The only problems are 1: I can't add profile pics from my gallery. 2: You can not send links. My biggest problem is that even tho my internet is is fine i can not video call, send pics or not even send texts. This is a big problem for me. I rlly want to text my friends and it will not let me. I stopped talking to my cousin 7 months ago from this issue. It also doesn't give me notifications. Pls fix this. Other than that, The app is great! I totally recommend!",
"Over all great app! Though I wish we could send GIFs made from our galleries. The app sometimes glitches out if I'm off it too long so I have to restart everything. And there are many bugs that could be fixed in this app, As call disconnecting when your off it too long, When writing it glitches out same as voice recording. And I can't hear anyone or they can't hear me. I hope these glitches get fixed. Thank you!",
"Great, safe app. The only bad things are that you can't use a picture from your gallery for your profile, and the music feature needs to be updated. They added songs a few months ago and the same old songs are still there. Love to see that changed. All in all a great app for kids who are not quite ready for social media but want to keep up with their friends outside of school.",
"Very nice app. I do however have a few critiques. Number one, is that you can't change the profile picture to a a gallery picture on some devices. The picture could be changed on an iPad, but not a Samsung phone. Parent could not change it through her Facebook either. she had to send me the picture, but I could not use my phone. Instead I had to download it on the iPad my brothers use, and change it through that. It was, over all, a huge extent to go to to get an up to date picture. My second critique is the colors. You can chose a color for everything to be based off of, but there are hardly any options, and after you chose a color, you can't go back to the original grey and blue. None of the colors are really appealing, and sometimes, it won't let you change them at all. It is very annoying. And number three, I wish you could snooze people, or something like that. Sometimes people will spam the call button, even when I tell them I don't want to talk, especially when they can see my face. I don't want to block them, because that is rude, they are my friend. I just don't want to talk then. A Snooze or Silence or Ignore would be nice. None of these problems really bother me to much. It just could use some improvement.",
"Edited to add: problem has been fixed and app is working perfectly again! Thank you! Absolutely LOVED this app when my son first started using it last year. Well we had to replace his tablet recently and now we are unable to get it to work on the new tablet! Same login issues as listed by others...I login, it thinks for a second, flashes to a ""logging out"" screen, then returns to login screen.",
I use this app alot to talk to Friends and Family. However recently I've stopped receving notifications even though I dont have notification off. The ringtone is annoying and most of the sounds are pretty bad. Ive also tried to send things to multiple people or change my Emoji and im only getting the option to send it to my most recently added contacts. I would also think the color you app is should be more like the version on Apple or at least have more of color varieties.,
"I definitely recommend if you use facebook or messenger and your child wants to be able to talk to their friends over the internet. But, I also think they should add a feature in wich it allows you to customize your own ringtone. Also, sometimes when I tap the call button, it will start the call, then it will instantly kick me out of the call, I don't know if that's intentional, but if it isn't, it NEEDS to be fixed.",
"I love this app! You can chat with friends or family, call, play games, and take funny photos! But you may be wondering why I gave this four stars. Well first of all when it shows the three dots when someone is texting well they are not really texting sometimes. Also same with when they are ""online"" when they could be out of the app. Second of all when you are on a call..once I was on a call with my friend and when they hung up it still showed I was still on the call. I hope this was helpful.",
"This is an excellent app, but its so hard to try and share a screen on the app. I have to use an entire different device to show a screen and even then its backwards. Adding a share screen feature would be absolutely amazing. Please at least consider a share screen feature. Otherwise this app is awesome. Keep up the great work!",
"great app!! i just really think there should be an option to change the color of text bubbles on android phone. i have a03s, and there‚Äôs no option to change my text color unless i were to use an ipad/tablet. it‚Äôd be great if it was updated where you can change text bubble color on phones, and maybe add more colors, w/ designs. other than that, this is a great way to message for kids!!!",
"Great app, not sure if it's just my phone, but one time it just disappeared. It said it was still installed, but it never came up in my searches. Also, it makes a weird noise when I text someone and it makes an even weirder noises when I send a video. It also makes a wonky noise when I send a thumbs up. I have no idea what causes it, but I dont really like it.",
"Great overall, but I hate two things. The first thing is the audio. When I am connected to a bluetooth device, the audio from a call still goes to the phone audio. I found no way to make the audio direct to the wireless earbuds, so I contacted the support email for this. Here comes the second reason I don't like this. I emailed the email provided for the app, and they didn't reply within a month. I contacted them again, and the same thing happened.",
"NOICE. Toast Girl approves of this. Just, a suggestion here. The ability to re-send photos. 1. Resend A photo to the same person you already sent it to 2. The ability to save videos to your gallery 3. The ability to send old photos/videos to different people. 4. The ability to save effects. Again, just some suggestions!",
I love this but there a few things I don't like. These are that there should be the option to make a normal call instead of a facetime.I also can't access some of the new features like song maker and the emoji by my name. Another thing is that I want to use screen shots and photos from gallery but I have to take a picture on the spot( for profile picture),
"The screen is black a lot of the time and I have to re-call them multiple times before it fixes itself. Also, I hardly ever get the notifications of my friend messaging me and makes it extremely difficult to maintain a connection between each other, especially in 2020 where we hardly ever see each other. I also wish there was a regular call option aswell instead of just a video chatting option, if there is I can't find it. It would be lovely if these issues could be fixed or updated.",
"So, I have no problems. App works fine and I love it! But... My friend every now and then gets alerted that I messaged her, but it don't show up. Then when I c all l her and she calls me, it says the call failed. It's sad because she moved across the country and this is are only way to really text each other. Seriously, you need to fix this before you lose customers.",
"Great app BUT the inability to just turn it off, at any given time, outside of putting it into sleep mode is a problem. Smaller kids have no limits when it comes to re-dial, I've learned - so I need to be able to hit a button on my end to just shut it off, without having to go all the way into settings to reset sleep mode hours to adjust them - and then readjust them back later. That is TOO MUCH maintenance. Please consider a way to save working-from-home parents from constant ringing.",
It used to work really well but now when I type I have to touch the text bar and type one letter and tap it again to type more witches super annoying. And the games don't really work I've tried the pet and the other games but they just don't really work. I also wish it would give me notifications when someone texts me so I don't text them back three days later. Other than that it's a great app.,
I hate this app. I have a lot of problems with it so here is a list: 1. It doesn't notify me when people send me stuff. It doesn't make the notification sound AND it doesn't show who texted me and at what time. So I basically don't know whether someone messaged me or not. 2. The video chat is always glitching out for no reason. 3. I also can't see my friend's messages when they send me something which is frustrating.,
"This app is great! You can't swear or use inappropriate language, you can block, mute and unfriend people who are rude. And there's alot of unique features such as filters and so on. But there is one thing. When you put your hand, or anything on the camera the screen turns black automatically, I know it may be for many reasons but it gets annoying when your trying to play a game when on a call and you have to try not put your finger on the camera. Other than that, this app is highly recommended!",
"Some suggestions: add a way to have the side bar where you hold and slide thru the chat or a way to teleport to the top of the chat. Add a way to use all filters or a filter gallery! So that old filters are avaliable and are sorted by oldest to newest! And make it so u can save videos, this is the feature I want the most because having to screen record videos is annoying. Please fix the videos so they load when there older then 2020. Please fix the video chat filters so they work! Ty for reading",
"I'm not sure if it's because I have a Chromebook ( or Chrome OS ) or not. Because when I try to make a video it always says ""failed to capture video"" or something. I really want to be able to record a short video. And I also don't know if this is a bug or not. but if it is PLEASE FIX IT üò≠ everything else is good though. It's been like this foreverr üò≠",
"Good for kids not recommended for teens or young adults, you can send vids under 3 minutes if they are on your gallery, but when you're on the app you can't send them over a minute. The only thing I really don't like is that you sometimes can't view pics. and you can't save videosüò• would be nice if that was changed but overall good for kids, very safe and fun! recomend for children under 10.",
App is great but it's buggy as heck lately. I can see someone has sent voice messages and photos but they don't show in the chat to look or listen to. My kids communicate with voice messages as they learn to spell. So it's very disappointing they can't use the app to message others.,
"I personally love it (I'm a kid) and I can call all my friends and family on it. The one thing that I don't like is when I call my best friends on it and we decide to play roblox or something else, it just randomly dissconects me and my friends and family on the call. I have no idea why but it also freezes randomly and it doesn't allow me to click on anything.",
"I like this app a lot but phones cant tap in calls. If there is a filter that you tap to activate, it won't work. Me and some of my friends have this problem. But its a great messaging app for kids. Edit: how come my friend has video editing? I rlly want to have it on mine too.",
So I love this app and it works great there are games cute filyers to play around with in the app and you can even make group chats. The only issue is if I'm on a call with someone then someone else calls me it doesn't give me a notification that someone else is calling me. Because of that when I get a call they can call non stop and it won't tell me. Other than that the app is great I'm just hoping that the creators of the app can fix that.,
"I think it is very good for the kids to connect but I do think it would be better if it was easier for them to get their contacts because you have to do this whole thing and it's hard because sometimes you don't have their parents contact so maybe it would be better to give them a wide variety of people, like maybe they could pick the area they live in or something then like look at the people to choose from and if the accidentally choose the wrong person you can easily delete them rite",
"So I like this app cause I'm a kid and stuff and I can talk to certain people like my family or far away friends but it totally is random. For example, if your calling a friend and want to play a game that the call lets you use, you can't tap on anything. It's fine on the normal video camera but the calling games and filters don't let you tap the screen. Also, you cannot delete messages or even edit them. The concept of the app is nice but, but the flaws are not. 3/5 :I",
"This app is great for little kids, but not so much for teenagers like myself. There's also lots of glitches, like sometimes it won't let you look at pictures and videos that friends send, and in its place are just white squares. Most of the time, it doesn't notify me when someone messages me, and it sometimes wont send messages! Oh, and I accidentally logged out, and it says 'lOgiN fAilUrE' when I try to log back in. I even tried it on another phone, and it STILL won't work. Please fix thissss",
"I used to have 4 stars but no more. The app doesn't send notifications so I have to manually click the app to see if I have messages, it sometimes crashes my phone, when I try to send a link it doesn't send, i can't change the theme (such as dark mode or changing the text bubble color), when I scroll up videos and pictures are blank and don't load at all, you can't save videos and last if you unfriend someone in a group you get completely removed and you can't get back even if parents add you",
"It's a very good app :) I have suggestions. 1, implement a rainbow theme, 2, add a new mini game for your pet where you have to memorize where the candy is. It's OK if it's not added but it would be nice „ÉÑ",
"Messenger Kids is great, but can you please add: - a 'share screen' button in a call - a place where you can change the background of the group chat - a way to change the colour of your text bubble If you can add these, thank you SO MUCH! Here are some problems: - sometimes I send a message and it says unable to send - in calls some filters say to tap on myself but when I do as told, nothing happens. Can you PLEASE fix these? ü•∫",
"Fun! My daughter is 6 and she loves this app. She gets to talk to her friends and our family that don't live close by. I see everything she sends and receives. I can control who can message her and who can be on her friends list. She likes making silly videos and always wants to post them on ""YouTube or tiktok.. etc. So this app is great for her. Instead of for the whole world she can send her videos to the family/friends on her list.",
"it's aight, but when I'm on a call (im on Tablet so only video call) it makes my screen go black and It wont respond to touch or button presses so i have to Hard reset my device and im on Android 12, also needs dark mode, needs more personalization, and it's really strict I also can't find my friends when I request to add one. Overall needs more features and bug fixes 3/10",
"Can't use the app on a new device. Downloaded the app and I get as far as entering my Facebook login to authorize my child's device and the whole app shuts down and stops responding and then kicks me back to the beginning over and over again. If you Google the issue, it's very clearly a known problem that evidently still hasn't been addressed and reports of it are documented going back a year which would indicate that it's not likely to be addressed any time soon. :(",
"I have a Motorola phone and on calls it WON'T let me play games on call, the games load, but it won't let me play, it will not let me tap it to be able to play. I'm not changing My rating until this is fixed. Also android doesn't have the same things that Apple has. On Apple you can change your theme to one called ""unicorn"" or ""nature"" or something like that. I would like that on android too.",
"I love it! I do really enjoy this app, I always text my friends but when my tablet is off the messages don't show up on screen. Also early this week I was going on messenger kids and then I accidently click switch profile in settings, I am somewhere else and I can't exit it, plus I can't even text my mom about it, so I cant go back to text it has been like this for 3 days now and I can't do it until Friday. Other then that it's amazing! J love it alot I truly recommend but just don't be like me",
"This app is solid, but also really annoying. It doesn't let you send links or delete messages, and sometimes when they send photos, it's just a blank white rectangle. Also when I ask my parents to friend someone, it dosen't message them. It's good overall though, I'm not complaining much.",
"Love it! But it needs some updates. I want like the normal Messenger like UI for both Android and iPhone, plus glitch fixes. Also the Calls section we have on the normal messenger so that my kid can call them back. And also the settings tab separated for easy access. And stories tab like messenger, which you can see the stories of your friends and the friends of your kids friends and not the adults friends. And also a option for voice calling. For both iOS, Android and iPadOS.",
"I love this app so much! I couldn't live without it. I love this app very much! But I do have a suggestion.Please remove sleep mode it's very annoying and for some people who don't have phone numbers this is their only way to communicate with family and friends, it can be a problem having no way to communicate because of sleep mode. Also I asked my parents to turn it off but they don't know how so I'm stuck with it.",
I've installed this app on multiple devices and can't even get my child registered. I get an error message every time... And I've been trying for months! Very frustrating,
GREAT!!!! But please make it so you can send GIFS. Not the GIFS On the app But GIFS on the keyboard. Btw umm this is a edit and I wanted to say that you should be able to change and record ringtones. I'm tired of the same old sound and also add dark mode.,
"App accepts parent phone and password, and then it says it sent me a login code. Code is not in email, text, or authenticator, and I'm unable to authorize the device. We tried two (Android) devices and have the most recent version. Will happily update review once resolved.",
"I would rate 5 stars but I have 2 tooken away for 2 reasons. The first reason is when I'm running the fall in the background and playing games with my friend, when I cover the camera by accident the screen goes black. Please make a feature to turn that off. And the second reason is that I want you to add screen sharing. I would appreciate it if you did. Thanks for your time.",
Every time I try to take a video it switches to photo and when I am on texting someone and they accidentally call me they try to hang up and say that was an accident I'm sorry I say it's ok but what makes me angry is when you try to text someone else I leave there page but it tells I missed a call from that person when I know this app is just getting more boring there used to be stickers you collect but now you have every single one so please stop making me about to delete this app!!!!!!!!!!!!,
I love it but be careful because you could cuz a lot of things could happen some of them are a little crazy but overall I love the game a lot it's really fun I can take my aunt during the day it doesn't matter what time it is because there's no time restrictions you would have to let those up yourself but my parent did not set it up like that yeah I would say a really really good game,
"Me and my best friend like to talk to each other all day well, not all day, mostly at the end of the day, but we're still working on it anyway sometimes my friends Luna doesn't have new AI skins on her computer and it makes her sad that I do and makes you even more sad that I do I'd like you to fix that but anyway it's a good app that's why I gave it a five-star",
I like this because im a kid but you cant change ur color easy and if ur in a call using a filter u cant click on it and recently it doesnt let me see photos that people send me and you cant unadd anyone only block. Also if i get in a call there screen will be black and i cant hear them so ihave to restart my tablet. 3/5 :<,
Very good app but I got a few problems 1.It will go beep beep beep every so often and hang up. 2. Sometimes I can't here people I was calling. 3. If the people over the phone move the electronic I can here it or if there playing with the case 4. Sometimes I don't get calls 5. My friends keep getting fake messages and sending them to me.6 I can't update me fav color,
This is a great app for my Kids to call and text their Friends and Family from diffrent parts of the World. It has a couple of glitches then and now but my kids are fine with it. It also keeps my Kids intertained with cool games and filters. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it only gives you 1 Minute to film a video. But otherwise it is a fun way to connect. It is also good because you can control and see what your kids have been texting and doing.,
"You guys lost the two stars, because it is very difficult to add people on there. It should be an easier way, I don't know how, but there should be an easier way. Update: now it won't even show any profile pics, gifs, or even photos. That is stupid",
"I logged my child out to log in to my other childs account and now I can't log either of them back in. The app is in some type of loop and just keeps saying something went wrong and for me to authorise account, which I do, then it says logging out asks which account I want to log in and when I pick one it says something went wrong and starts to entire process again. Doesn't matter what device I use. So now neither of my kids can use this app.",
I love this just think you could add more stuff. Ex. Not just video calling and the option to send links. And when I video call there is games which is fun but it wont let me do anything !,
It's fun but I would like it more if you could do voice call or ear call so you dont always have to do face time because it gets really boring just face timing all the time.,
I'm glad there is an app that allows my younger children to communicate with their friends in a safe monitored way. Without using MY cellphone! Messenger Kids works flawlessly. I can control every aspect of the engagement.,
"I love this app for my son, nieces, and nephews. The only thing I wish it had was notifications and things so when a friend or family member is trying to call or message they can answer or get the message.",
"Trying to make a new profile for my girls cause my Facebook got hacked (still no response or help from anyone at Facebook to help with that situation), but constantly says there's an error been like that for about a month now.",
It's great üòÉ Besides that when someone changes the theme of the group chat theme doesn't show. Also that when there are 2+ pictures it only shows the 1st picture. Please fix those things.,
When I was going to go add friend I accidentally pressed the logout button and I pressed on my account and it said get your parent to log into Facebook or whatever and then when we tried logging back in it said something went wrong it also said try again and I kept trying for a long time but it didn't work,
"This app was great for kids in the beginning but now there's too many issues, glitches, shuts off randomly, doesn't allow me to approve friends for my child, drops calls like crazy!",
I really like this app it helps me stay in contact with my friends and family but it won't let my messages go through until the person that I text opens the app so can you fix that??,
I love this app because I can call and texts my friends on it and play games to this is a good app for kids but the only thing bad is because your kids can text bad word but other then that its a great app!,
"Need more aged appropriate filters, The ones that are available very childish. And I would like to see more geared toward preteen filters in the camera and chat.",
I like this app it's just a lil difficult to sign in but it's a really good app and it's safe for kids you can see what your kids send and text and when the have a video chat with someone I recommend,
"It does have its bugs and all, but it's a very good app, I call and text my friends all the time with it, and everyone can use it, it's meant for kids mostly, but adults can use it to. I always just text my mom, my friends and stuff just like that, it's so fun, and it's just enjoyable, overall and stuff, so there's a lot of stuff you can do in there. I'm not gonna spoil it see you there",
"When it works, the video call quality is good. Text messaging as well as other features work pretty well but my biggest issue with the app is that it is unreliable. I had it on three different android phones and two android tablets. There are a lot of missed calls or calls that fong ring on the other side.",
I love this app I can talk to all my friends and family and it is a very nice kids app but I only have one problem I am in my home country I can call but when I go to my other country it does not work the calling so I would really like if you can change that problem but I will not dare give a bad review but I am asking nicely for you guys to just change that slight problem but overall everything is amazing I love thank you bye!,
I only gave it 3 stars cause it keeps glitching and hanging up calls and turns the device off and on someone need to fix the bugs in this app,
The app is great but whenever someone messages me sometimes the notification does not pop up so then I dont see the message. Please fix this as it is a very annoying glitch.,
"I love that i can chat with My friends but sometimes when i call them it shows me their old profile picture it has been glitchy too also it logged me out and i can't log back in the app to text My Friends/Family anymore it keeps saying ""The user not allowed to log into this app"" can You fix this bug Or atleast update the app Thank You if You ready this.",
When I play with my best friend on call my screen keeps turning black! It's really annoying and NOT cool at ALL hopefully you FIX this. cuz this is REALLY ANNOYING!,
It all of the sudden just stopped working. My daughter can't send any messages and there is no one on her friends list that live in Europe,
"It's great when it works... But it just logged my daughter out of her account and when I tried to log back in, it gives the same error message that ""This User is not allowed to log in on this app."" I tried to log on using another device and got the same message.",
"I like this app, but when I clicked this app to message my cousin, it's said that I don't have internet connection. But I do have WiFi. I hate the internet or the Wi-Fi so much, it always did that to me so many times when I was playing roblox or this. This makes me mad. But I'll give this a 5 star rated.",
"I've been using this app for years now, it only has a few minor problems but nothing big. There is only one thing I have been concerned with, once when I was on a cruise, I tried to text my group chat, of course it didn't work because I had no Wi-Fi. But recently, it would delete all my previous messages and take me back to March (which is when I went on the cruise) and I would have no data of anytime after it besides 5-10 messages from not too long ago. Otherwise, I really recommend this appüòä",
"This app is pretty good i can call my friends like i should. But it lags pretty bad. Like when ever im on a call the filters lag. I click on one of the double filter (the games) and it kept saying their name. ""_____ is not ready to start this game"" But over all the app is really good",
"It's very safe and fun but what was annoying for me is that you don't have the option to change your ring tone, after I come back to a video after a couple of weeks it doesn't show and the screen turns gray, and lastly whenever I change my profile picture it looks different when I change it but when I call someone it changes back to the original one!",
"I wish that the kids could change names of thier contacts and make groups with whoever even if his/her two friends are not friends with each other. Overall I give the app a 3/5 otherwise the app is exeptional, and please please make my wishes come true.",
"So first you can't access filters on tablet second, the apple gets upgraded faster than Samsung third you can't change the names forth and can't change the color of the text messages. You can only change your texts!!",
"It's a good app in the fact that I can see what messages and content my daughter is sharing with her friends. It also allows her to connect with me via message or video when I'm out and she's at home with her Dad. However, we are having an impossible time finding her friends to add them. I'm not FB friends with all of her parents friends and let's face it, no kid is going to know their three words so we can look them up... Overall, great in some ways, sucks in others. And so buggy!!!!",
"This app is amazing it's how I talk to my friends, make plans, and a lot of other stuff! Some of my suggestions is adding screen sharing, being able to kick people out of a group, and seeing if people are taking a screen shot or not! Thank you for reading this <3",
"love the app, I can talk to my friends and family without Snapchat and such. i'm giving it a 4 star for a few reasons. 1 my friend told me that she's able to have dark mode, and I wanted it too but when I into my settings, there's no option for dark mode. I don't know if this is a apple/samsung thing, but I would love to get dark mode on Samsung. 2 my friend had also told me that you can the color of the bubble of the text, and I don't have that setting either. add these to Samsung please.",
App worked great for a few days. But now the audio doesn't work. I have to uninstall then reinstall to make it work again. I have to do this every couple of days. Fix the app powers that be...,
I love it its a great way to talk to friends if you can't text or call normally you can even play games with them I highly recommend üëå,
great app for chidren to keep in contact with freinds without you having to worry about anything because you must give permission to have friends and stuff like that,
"It's really buggy. When I call my friends, it has a glitch! The glitch is the screen flashes black and back to the normal screen OVER and OVER! It's REALLY annoying! üëé",
Love that I can call and text my cousin. But I'd really like use the faces like these ' :( ' or others but now with an update they think it's a wonderful idea to change it to emojis. It would be more if it wasn't for THE DANG :] FACES TURNING INTO EMOJIS by the way I'm not a fan of the filters.....but I won't go there...next I can't have a voice clip longer then 10 seconds,
"I really love this app and got it during quarantine :) however, last year all of the games and filters disappeared and it is now very boring :( wish this was fixed!!",
I did the I did the thing where you spend nine people something restart my phone and I got nothing also there's so many glitches that happen my touch screen doesn't work but it usually works in this app is taking up a lot of space,
"Messenger Kids is a very safe and useful app. It allows kids to talk to their friends and family without having spam or scam calls or texts from other people. It also doesn't allow kids to text bad things or emojis. It also doesn't allow kids to add anyone to their contacts without having their parents permission. When your kid asks to add someone to their contacts, it sends a text to their parents immediately. This app is very helpful and safe for your child, ( or children.) You should try it!",
"I rate it as 2 stars for 2 reasons, 1. You cant sign into your own account, I was moving apps to another phone but it didn't have a sign in option, and 2. You cant send links to other people, I send links all the time but with this app, you cant share videos with other people unless you record it",
I wish it didn't make me use Facebook book I don't have a Facebook page and I don't plan to.. and I just wanted and account for myself to contact people because my texting apps are bad,
"This is a pretty good app. It's like texting, but you can send fun games. The only 2 reasons I gave this 4 stars is because the graphics and when the app falls asleep. I can't do much on it in the evening because it always falls asleep that time.",
I rate this app a 5 star because it's amazing your children get to chat with all there friends and family the only suggestion I have is that we can play other games and sometimes when I'm on a call to my friend her faces won't work but my'n do so that is my suggestion.,
"My daughter hasn't been able to message me for over 3mths and all because she sent herself pictures OF US from my phone to hers. This was our only means of contact. I have reported issues and nothing has been done, absolute joke!!",
It's a great app I can talk to all of my friends and parents but the thing that isn't good is the invite because I can't change it so I can invite my friends my mom had to do it so it takes so long for them to respond and why can't it just be were you invite them and you're friend just accepts its. But it's a good app but the invite system isn't you can't send links. I know that a lot can be bad but if me and my friend just want to rickrole each other. WE CANT. But it's good without that.,
"This app is very good but recently I haven't been getting notifications when people message me, its very annoying when im trying to talk to people. I now only see that they've messaged me when I actually go into the app. Show please fix it",
Ok when I first got this app good Sending fast until 2 years (in a half) The app slow sending call I call my Friends it all want it said was connecting Until it said calling for a week things were good until now I got a phone number much better than this app and messages 2 years in a half it good sending until now messages take super long to send and Seems like it never sends I had so many problems with sending and calling and that's why it's 1 star,
When my daughter is on a call her phone glitches really bad and she doesn't get notifications when someone calls her also it randomly loged her out also we can't log back in now she can't message her friends on her phone we uninstalled it now we can't even install it. It is too bugy,
This is way better than about a year ago. It used to be glitchy but I don't really use this. I had galaxy s7 then I had s10 and I have s20 fe now and it's way better. I also need you guys to bring back decorate your app. It was the best feature for messenger kids.,
This app is so much fun for your children and it helps your children interact with friends and family without having to have a phone. I love this app I can FaceTime friends and family that have Iphones.,
This game is so fun Kids can keep in contact with their friends And Family It's so fun they get to send pictures And your filters. And this game is very appropriate. I love it. And I will always continue to use it.,
Very easy to use and to control my sister's account. I love it when you can create a account for your kids or siblings! Very easy and convenient to use for your kids and siblings! Recommended to download this on your kids/siblings gadgets!,
"The app is great! everything was fine until by accident I unfriended my friend and now I cant get her back, I tried multiple times but i cant. Please try to make unfriending friendable thank you!",
"I give it a 4 star because it would be better if it could let you change your friends name/ and/or your name without making a new account but, you can still see their name and the name you give them.Thank you for reading this ! -The app lover",
"I love the app, but lately it's been glitching a bit, and also I wish you could change the ringtone for calls.",
Its an amazing app and all but i just want themes like my cousin she could have a blue or green backround so just pleaseee make it available for all devices like phones laptops or android stuff like that but besides that i love the app very much just a few glitches,
So disappointed. Tried to add another child to my account many times and got nothing but an error message. He was so excited to use it too.,
"It's a good app you can talk to your friends one bas issue is If I try to play games on it, it doesn't work if i'm trying to send a game to someone, it doesn't work DON'T NOT EVER GET THIS THING",
"Great app for texting and keeping in touch with friends! There is also a wide variety of games and camera filters to choose from. Sometimes the games have glitches, like in the emojiplane game, there is no visible paper airplane. Otherwise, awesome app!",
"I really like this app for kids to chat on, but when we try to change our profile picture the app automatically put the picture in a certain way, and I would really like it if we were able to put the picture in a certain way.Also I wish the app had more options for the 'favorite color'. Another thing is that when one person sends a text to a another person it takes forever to send the text to the person. When you get the text the person that sent the text is already offline.",
"The app quality is good and everything else is good but I'm not getting notifications. When I got my new phone I was getting notifications for like a week or so then they just stopped. I've checked through all of my settings and it's all turned on. (Btw the notifications didn't work on my last phone either, so it's no because of my phone)",
"It okay. But sometimes when I call a friends or family far away it nomally crashes of glitches. Plus the screen gets pixelated sometimes and its really annoying for both my Tablet and my chromebook. So if you can, can you please try to fix that? Thank you very much if you at least try to!",
"The app used to work great but for some reason it has stopped working recently. My daughter has not been able to login to the app in quite sometime. She gets an error 'he user is not allowed to log into this app'. She has the latest version, there are no restrictions enabled. Facebook support are yet to respond to my email. I will update rating once the issue is resolved.",
"There's a few things I would change about this app. It's nice for a few reasons but I don't like that you can't change the background to dark mode especially. I also don't like that the child can't add anyone who's parents are friends. While I know it's for safety, it'd still be helpful if used right. Maybe if they both had each other's codes.. Other than thosez it's fine",
"Push notifications not working. Notifications only show up when app itself is open. Can go days with messages sitting there without being notified that they have been received. This app is getting worse, why are friend requests still showing up after they have been accepted or denied? Friend requests from my daughters tablet have been sent, but no notifications will show up in regards to this on my phone. App is rubbish üóë",
"I love this app! I always use this to text my friends and family. One thing tho is after a while i can't listen to my old voice messages,it doesn't let me tap on them, please fix this! But overall its a good app. I recommend having your kids try this app. Its a great way to communicate to their friends. And theygive us filters to mess around with giving the kids sometting fun to do, i really like this app and i use it every day. The only thing is that i can't listen or tap on old voice messages.",
I love this new update but can you make it look more fun and less like a regular messaging app it looks really plain and I think it could use more color. Also can you bring back being able to choose the color of your text I think that makes this app stand out! Other then that this app is amazing,
"It was working fine, now there is nothing but glitches. For no reason, I'm unable to add her friends no matter what I try. I can't even create a new account. There is no information anywhere to help fix this, no one to call, and tech doesn't respond when you file a report. Utter nonsense. There should be just as much support for kids as their is for adults. Please fix!",
"This app is awesome for kids to use that with parents, grandparents, cousins,aunts ,uncles,and friends to chat with each other when they ain't seeing each other face to face. So I recommend this for you kid.",
"I used to love this app. But now anytime I need to re-log my kids in, it takes an act of congress to log them in. I'm trying to log my daughter in on her phone because her tablet won't allow calls or messages to come through unless she's in the app and the setting I need to change to fix it, I can't change! I am so frustrated with this. It must be a new update causing this issue because it used to work just fine!!",
Can't text certain people and I don't even need to update it and my friends can't even work the filter games.,
"Terrible. Love the idea of this chat platform but where the heck are you sending the ""code"" Facebook? It's not coming to my email as the parent, or as a text, or to what's app. Useless.",
Keeps logging my daughter out. Not allowing her back in. We made multiple different accounts an still having the same issues. This is really disappointing an extremely time consuming.,
"I like talking to my friends and my family and this But when I try to show my videos, it just says Not able to send I even worked hard on those videos too. So can you help this, please?",
Glitches every so often but really nothing bad. I do have one suggestion when it's in sleep mode somewhere on the sleep mode screen you should put what time it turns back on cuz half of the time my mom forgets. It's a really good app to communicate with your friends and family.,
"I love the app but it needs a dark mode. Whenever I open the app it's so bright that it feels like my eyes are burning off. Please fix this, thanks!",
Not sending links.... Facebook just randomly decided to take link sharing away so now I can't send funny videos or song from YouTube to my kid. It's b.s. that as an adult I can't send her messages that I decide are safe for her.,
Amazing I love that the text sends so fast and calls are really loud so I love it everything is amazing but it would be nice to have more filters (I'm 9),
Very good app but PLEASE PLEASE make it so you can add people to the same group even if they aren't friends,
The app is cool I like everything...BUT when I get a bunch of pictures at once it gitchis out really bad and I can look at the picture pls fix this issue,
It's a good app but when I try to call someone it connects and doesn't call them so if you could fix this that would be amazing but this is why I'm only giving it a 3-star,
"It is amazing for my kid, but she says she is not able to do things like decorate her app like other kids",
App is not working like it use to anymore. Having trouble logging my child into kids messenger right now. Not understanding why because we never had this problem and it's been 3 days an still can't get access to it which is weird because I'm using my email and password and clicking on my child's profile and it still doesn't go through all I get is this message saying login failure. Have no idea what's going on.,
Total pain in setting up with parents. It was very difficult for my husband and I to both be able to manage our sons account.,
It's a very good app! I love it sm! Allows my daughter to talk to her friends and family! Glad she showed me this for her! TBH this is VERY good üëç,
It is a app for people that are kids but older people can still use this app to yae it's a great I app I recommend it. But my problem is that well u can't call without video chating so ya that's really annoying me because I can't chat :[ so I'm gonna keep it at 4 star but if this changes than yes a five star!! :] also it should at where you can add a bio to talk about yourself. And make there be no limit to the character in the bio. For if you wanna add a limit make it 900 characters.,
"There's a bug, and despite multiple attempts to contact Facebook, we've been unable to log my daughter in since February. I put in my password to log in, but when I select my children and click next it logs me out. On the next screen when I select which of my kids accounts I want to view it says ""something went wrong."" She keeps in touch with long distance family and friends on this app so it's really been a downer for her. PLEASE FIX!",
This app sucks it let you get as far as logging in but once you click on the bottom messenger it takes you to the original Facebook messenger..it don't work,
I really like this app but i have 2 problems my tapping effects don't work so i can't do filters and 2 my messages won't sebd even though i have good internet,
It won't allow my child to use messenger or make video calls. It's showing the device is not authorized.,
"Bluetooth headsets, any headsets, do not work with this app. Not sure how that's possible as it seems like a basic function for an app like this. Find something else. Facebook is not putting anymore effort into this app.",
"This app does exactly what it's supposed to do - and more. I like how there are games you can play with your friends. Only complaint - if you're in the app, then there isn't a notification ""ding!"", which is annoying if you're AFK and aren't looking at the screen.",
i honestly love this app i call all my friends and you can even play games and even while you are on the call i just love it!,
"It stopped working. It prompted you to authorize the device, and log you out and ask you the same question again.",
"I understand this is like a kid version of facebook messenger, but like, some older kids are on this app as well, and most of the filters are really babyish, and there are a lot of bugs too. Not trying to sound rude or anything, but fix the app.",
"I accidentally logged out because there is nothing that says are you sure you want to log out and now my parents have to do all the work to get me logged back in witch is not something that should have to be done 2 times because of a small ""mistap"". Its also glitchy I cant see vidios I or my friends send withch is pretty annoying. (Edit) the games are horribly laggy and the calls quality are garbage for me and my friends. I have been in calls and it freezes. At least try and fix this",
Great app. There's just one problem I kept trying to log in but it isn't working please fix the error.,
Nice to communicate with kids who don't have smart phones. Easy to allow only certain people [chosen by guardian] to access the child.,
"It is so fun it's just like the normal messenger but a kid kind , and there's also little games on the messenger app ,I would give it 5 stars ! I'm a 10 year old, but I love this app !",
"Very good app. However, when I am on a call with someone, my screen tends to become black. The person who is on the call with me can not play a game with me or interact with me because my screen is black. Another reason is that when someone wants to play a game, that is the dog racing game, I can not play because you have to tap the screen to move. However, my phone won't let me move because you have to tap and I will not move. Finally, this app is great, but it just needs some fixes.",
The app is hard to navigate. And approving new contacts is extremely hard.,
This app is the best ever. You really do get to play games and talk to friends and video chat them and there are tons of filters for sending pictures and being silly while talking to your friends. There is plenty of things to do- get it now! (Plus to all ad haters there are 0 ads!) So get this app it's free,
"It is good overall, but there is one major issue. I'm not sure how to completely remove a person, if it is even possible. Maybe you could add that option?",
Very good for talking to your friendsüòÄ. The activities are very fun. My favorite is the drawing one.,
"Most of the time, I have no issues. But I recently tried to switch between my kid's profiles and repeatedly got error messages. I can no longer log in on my phone to monitor their messages",
I love this app it's so fun for kids and stuff but the only thing I think they should add to it is you get to go through and add your own filters,
It's very good for kids. Everytime you say a cuss word it'll send a notification to the child's parent.,
"It wouldn't let me make an account on my phone when it worked just fine on my tablet. It has worked on a phone before with the same account but it is not working now, and that makes it quite difficult to talk to friends who do not have other messaging apps. Please fix this problem.üôè",
some times the screen goes black and i can't do the taping games either.,
Its good execpt it would be nice to have more than 30 filters. Snapchat has 1000! Otherwise great fun :-\,
"Used to be a good app for kids, but now it's really glitchy and wont let my child create an account.",
Text dose not send I have to call the person so it will send but the app is good and stuff like that,
"I love it!!!!!!!!!, But I would like if you added more games and fillters for kids!",
I can't see all my photos that kind of annoying but overall I think it's greatüçâüòçüòÅ,
Constantly have to download and open EVERY TIME I get a message.,
My child uses it all the time to safely communicate with her friends and I.,
My opinion messenger kid really glitchy yes it lets me chat and call my friends but not well it brings me out of call ends them sometimes muted them for now reasons üò°pls just use normal messager ok,
I like this app its just that everytime i wanna call my friend it says that someone texted to something like that but they didn't,
Amazing goodgame always keeping me company because I can't have wecibor any other thing I can always communicate with my friends here and it's always been awhile,
This is the best for kids but it glitches some times but over all it is the best,
I love this app and can agree with parents in the comments deff need a grounded button and to be able to see conversations between parties x),
I love this message so much love texting but when me and my BFF start playing Roblox it says connecting can you please fix the bug love Izzy üíò,
Keeps logging out and giving error. Will not log in,
It's has so many bugs I can't make an account for my son it's so annoying.,
Its completely locked me out from accessing my children's messengers on my phone to help keep tabs on them!,
I love this app so very much I would do 4 and half Stars. That's Because it lags and the codes are easy to forget. The mini games are a lot of fun. It's weird that you can write swear while it is a kids app.,
So far very impressed. Things appear to have been tightened up since the days of pre-Meta Facebook.,
"Parental controls are useful, but cannot allow links to be shared anymore --> parents cannot send educational links to their kids!",
"Easy to use for me & my Children, pretty glad Messenger created One for children as well!",
"There is no parity between iOS and Android. It is also very slow and buggy. The games are not there, there is no explore tab, everything is just broken. Awful. Do better, Meta.",
"I loved it, but the one thing that made it a 4 star review is that most of the games i tryed to play on it to show to my friends. They would not work or they would not load. Idk if its jist me or not but if you can, please fix this",
I love messenger kids it's one of my favorite apps to talk to friends.,
"This app is pretty awesome! I can easily control my kids and I know that they are safe. I request that they add a few things though. Like when you get sent a video from someone, you can't save it. And on Android devices you can't select a photo from your gallery as your profile picture. That is really annoying. The final thing I recommend in them adding is some more colours to where you choose the colour of the app and your texts. Overall, I gave it 3 stars as there is features they should add.",
Clunky and hard to navigate as a parent. Tried numerous times to add myself to my daughters account and it never works,
Pretty good but there is wrong spelling like in a would you rather it would say wold.,
It's ok but it's very babyish and not good for older kids like 10+I am 12 I think I got this app when I was like 8 years old I am about to turn 13 now and it's just too babyish but I have keaped it because I can not find a nover safe app for my age,
I love the app except for all my friends on different phones and there are Apple phones by the way they can put a voice effect on their voice and the voice messages and they can record them on the Doodle Pad and then send it as like a video when mine only does a picture,
Best app for kids because you don't have to have any time on your phone and I'm a kid and I thank you to the people that made messenger,
"Bro, this episode, I only have a Facebook, and I'm a grown adult. My children is crying.since I don't have one, you are the worst app ever",
I love it because it has no ads and it has games that we can play it just very special to me I love it,
"Very good, but If I send a very long message like a chain mail or something, the screen blanks out and kicks me out of the app. It's been several days and hasn't changed. Sometimes I wish you could do custom text colour, like where you can use a colour wheel. The games dont load, only some of them, even though I wait 5 minutes. But otherwise, it's a good app.",
"A fun safe way for kids to start to learn how to use social media platforms. It's great as I can see who's calling, approve who's on the friends list and I don't have to worry about strangers. Fun games good pictures,it helps them connect with friends safely. My only drawback is sometimes it's hard to find people on the list to add. Everyone shows up but screw people and it doesn't give you an option to find them any other way. But other than that very great app.",
"My daughter had this app and loved it. She used it heaps till the point I'd set limits on it. But today was a big NOüëé. We we're sent a msg from a friend saying ""Has your daughter blocked my kids"". I decided to check her account, and it was deleted. She couldn't find her account with all her friends (we are travelling). We remade an account with nobody bigger thumbs down. Besides that, the app would be great üò°",
Basically just a messaging app but with weird games and gliches. It also has stupid rules like no custom gifs.,
"I have all the notifications set to on, but when I get any messages from my daughter, I don't receive any notification at all. I'm getting important messages from her too late and this needs to be fixed!",
"Messenger kids is a fun app which I can use to associate and chat with my friends and family, but there were a lot of errors happening with the photo sending. Whenever I wanted to send a photo or a video to my family/friends, it wouldn't send properly and would always turn into an error, where my family/friends cannot look into. Messenger kids is a fun app, but also has many errors and glitches that we just cannot stand to face.",
"this is simple app to chat with friends, BUT I CAN'T EVEN VIEW A WHOLE VIDEO, the screen just stops like it freezes and it's annoying because I get sent lots of videos.",
This is a horrible thing u have to do all this signing in and this is stupid i tried putting in my password and they wont vertify so if they read this fix this is horrible,
It is perfect for kids. It will not allow you to send inappropriate stuff. It has games and 2 player games also. I think this app is PERFECT for my kids. You should get it for yours too! It is awesome!,
It is really good but sometimes when I make a call it says I don't have internet and every time it happens I have to close the app,
I love messenger kids but whenever someone sends me a video I can watch only 2 seconds of it until it freezes and then never loads again. Can you please fix this bug on the app!,
Idk if it's a good app bc I cannot login it just says something went wrong please fix this I have waited 7 months and says the same thing,
"With video calls, the audio doesn't work with Bluetooth devices, not to mention my massages would randomly disappear, and I would only see a few messages I typed a couple minutes before and then automatically sends me back to something I typed months ago. There is no way to get those messages back. I tried updating and uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but they are just gone.",
"Terrible app, always glitches, doesn't send me my son's message notifications, the whole point is so the parent can monitor the child üò°",
It is safe for kids but I cant no matter what see the profile pics! I like the app tho but YOU NEED TO FIX THIS!!!!! very disapointing.... I would love to give at least a four star but I cant it is bad fix this as soon as you can..,
The app isn't working. Family members have been deleted and I am unable to add them back on. Doesn't work with FB Lite either. Not user friendly. Cannot find instructions!,
Fun app. I can chat and face time video chat with you friend. You can do cute filters on the camera and I love this app. So does my friend. You can only chat with people if you get their code or request You get a code you have to give them too. Great app. You should download it for your kid!!!,
"Hello!your app is very great for kids but there's a problem which when I call my friend and we want to play a game filter it won't let Us play because when we click something it doesn't allow us, and when there's a face filtre it doesn't allow us to click too, can you please fix this app?",
i love the app its the only way i can communicate with my friends but one problem whenerver i put my finger near the right hand cornor of my screen or the camera it will turn my screen black and nothing is functional and i have to wait for my screen to turn back on again and my friends say it happens to them often toand i know it happens to criqket and i know it happens to everyone else who uses messenger kids or it can be very rare if it doesnt happen to some people yet again it is glitchy.,
sucks barly any things work the emogies gifs and other things barly pop up lags half of the time on calls and uses barly any internet while taking up most of it the only reason why I use it is because my friends have it and we cant find a replacement wouldn't use if I didn't have to.,
"This is the best app ever!! I absolutely love this app! It is just like messenger but you HAVE to facetime and you cant put ur phone,tablet,iPad etc. Right up to your ear so I hope this helps!!!",
Nobody unknown cant talk to you I reccomend for 7-11 years old you can send invitation codes to chat with friends and if you cant find their code you just type their first and last name parents can also just add people off of messanger and Facebook I definitely recommend one thing I dont really like is it doesnt ring when somebody calls you but other than that it's amazing it even has kid friendly filters but I wish their were better ones in the future but except that its great,
"Great app over all, but with my friend it keeps kicking us out of the call. Also it says she's unable to send me anything we can only call, and please add share screen. It'll be helpful. Thank you",
It's fun and easy to use but lately it's been really bugged. I haven't been able to see my texts or anything the calling barley works and I haven't been using it as much. So please fix it,
So ive had this app for 3 years now and its great its just 3 things 1 parents acepting kids invitations to add ppl to there contacts it a great idea but i dont like how you have to be friends with the childs mom or dad to add them so i couldnt add my friend because my mom dosent have her mom as a friend on facebook. 2 the filters are great but when it says tap and you tap nothing happens idk if its only for me though. Number 3 it wont send me notifcations when sombody text me.,
Messenger Kids is the best. You can see what your kid send to people. It is the same as 5he normal Messenger but for kids. It does not have any glitches or anything. It is the best application for kids. I would give it 10 stars not 5. I love it so much.‚ù§,
"Can't send links to kids, no warning or reason. Please bring this feature back! I get denied by messenger when trying to send my kids link for crafts to pick out. Nothing in the settings to change this.",
I've been using this app to txt and video chat with my grandson. Now that he's been in summer camp and I can't... I get a message saying my account is being deleted. Well there's times I haven't logged into Facebook for months I don't see them deleting that account on me. Not happy,
"When I try to login my child it will not work at all, even the alternative will not login. So it's basically an app that just does nothing but take up space. Please fix this",
"It's so amazing when kids can mesege each other! It's totally free, no adds, and games for someone and their freind. I've also seen plenty of audults on this wounderful app. üòÉ",
My daughter and I love it she can call or text me anytime she can talk to all her friends and send tiktoks that she love to them by saving them to her gallery you definitely get but if she has no wifi or da-da than she cant call or text if she texts than it won't send untell later anyway 10/10 lovely day,
"It won't allow me to log into my kid's account when I check the info multiple times! Once this is fixed, then I will give higher rating.",
It's an okay app in general but it is so slow that sometimes it takes up to 12 hours to send a simple text (no it is no because of my wifi),
I like this app you can send GIF you can call this app is very good also you can play games like roblox during the call this app is amazing,
I accidentally logged out of my account and i cannot log back in every time i try to log in it makes me create a new account what do i do?,
"It doesn't even let me create an account for my child. When I click Create Account, it says an error occurred while creating the account. Why?? Please help with this problem!",
This app is so helpful cause when I'm not in school I can text my friends,
Headphones (both bluetooth and wired) don't work for messenger kids and it's really annoying. My headphones work on any other app when I call except messenger kids.,
It's fully working and calls just fine!!!,
"I usually call my friends because i dont feel like typing or i want to play games off the app while talking to them. But when im on a call for too long the screen starts going black and it really annoys both of us. Sometimes it randomly says ""unable to send"" when i have full internet on random texts or pictures, and parents should give their child privacy sometimes, but its still a good app.",
I think this app is amazing but every five minutes it takes the call off so we have to call again or restart are tablets so I hope you fix this glitch,
I love this app you can literally like do anything on it is so much fun like I use it everyday to call my friends,
"I got signed out and now I can't sign in it says ""failed to login""",
It was a good app but whenever i try to create a account it says there was an error every time,
I can text with my friend who actually lives in Ohio and my family and I works perfectly but sometimes it doesn't send texts and also never at night,
"Horrible, use to work fantastic now cannot add a kid or even access the account in any way what so ever.",
love it i can call my friend since we live far away but sometimes the video call ends by its self and freezes but other than that love it,
I don't use the app alot but I like it and I can communicate with friends and family,
It's amazing my kids can chat with there friends and they can't even see your Facebook account and they just burst out in laughter whenever there on a call with there friends I think you should check it out,
"For some reason, I don't have all the effects when I call my friend, if you could please fix this that would be awesome",
I really like the app but when I'm on a call and I'm playing Roblox it hangs up automatically so I have to talk in game,
no ads and its amazing! the parents can control what the kids are sending etc tysm messenger kids!!,
This app is great for my children talking to there friends and more!,
"I LOVEE this app, but on chess for minigames, it is only for iOS. I gwt it, but I was playing with is on iOS, it said it wasn't is. Plz fix it",
"I love this app, but there are a few glitches that could possibly be fixed in the future üîÆ",
I cannot download messenger kids on my computer so this will be a problem. It only says downloading on another device which is the phone.,
Great app for kids and it works really good there's also games they can play,
I've been trying to sign my daughter up for an account and I get all the way to the end and it says something went wrong.,
"My son cant hear me and I can't hear him. Super lagged and choppy. I checked mic, updates and settings. Nothing on our end. Please fix the bug!",
"Very easy to set up. The only thing you need to watch out for is, when adding someone the bottom of the friends list moves up. Then you accidentally add someone who you may not want to be added.",
"We've used this app for years, and it has been a great way for our kids to talk to their friends in a way that I can monitor. However, the app has not worked on my phone for over a month now. I was logged out and have cannot log back into it. I keep going in error message circles. I've uninstalled/reinstalled several times. Would love it if this could be fixed.",
"This app is descent because its really confusing with the codes to get a friends and the filters r not my fav and theres only video call also i kinda don't like that u cant choose ur freinds name how u label them like, best friend",
This app is great for my kids and their friends! I can see who they text and approve their friend requests! Great app!,
THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER IT KEEPS TELLING ME THAT SOMETHING WENT WRONG AND NOTHING WENT WRONG FIX THAT U HAVE THE WORST APP EVER,
"I was using the app, and sending random images on my device. But the app only shows square previewsf of images. So I accidentally sent the f-word twice in the group chat! And I couldn't even delete the messages because the only option is to copy the text! Please fix these issues with your app. Also when trying to use @ on someone, people sometimes show up as ""Facebook User"" instead of their name. Also there is no video off button in calls.",
"When a child sends a message... You as the parent can't UNsend it, neither can the child. Ridiculous because we as adults on adult messenger can UNsend. The kids messenger allows you to delete them but that doesn't take the sent message OFF of the recipients messages though... As far as my research went anyway.",
There is no adds and there is a lot of filters super fun and can Face Time and play Minny games for friends and you to play and there is texting too I love it! thanks for reading this. ( *¬Ø ¬≥¬Ø*)‚ô°,
Messenger kids is great! But my kid only has 7 friends who use it...so when you send her the different colors of the chat she gets upset because she doesn't have 9 or 10 friends. So please lower it to 6 or 7. Thanks!,
Very good you can talk to people and call text. you can add people I text your family and friends! I really like this app you should download this right now! I'm not forcing you but I'm telling you this right now this app is really fun you can give your friends questions and quizzes! This is really fun! Try it now!,
Latley for some reson when someone sends me a cople pics at the same tim it will only let my look at one picture.....please fixs this Also when i'm on video call it wont let me use any of the filters .... Over all its a good app,
I like kids messenger but the only problem is since I haven't enjoyed I can't change my texts color and I don't think it's fair for only Apple users to change their texts so please do the same thing for Android.,
I hate this app! Every time someone sends multiple photos at once it won't let me back into the chat. Also games never work. Video calls will randomly hang up and freeze. Don't install. You can't change your favorite color anymore. I don't like the app. Why is the update not avaliable for Samsung tablet?,
If you have an android you can't play chess and send voice messages with a filter. Lots of things restricted because you're on a budget.,
I am the kid and personally it's great for younger kids but my parents are making me use it at 15yo and there are way too many issues I really would love to do other things than just text and my parents invade my privacy,
"some games I play on here doesn't work for me, just few of the games work for me. I'm on Chromebook if you need",
"It's good, a few things that I dislike though. 1. It's says people are online when they aren't. 2. You can't send links to tiktoks or any sort of link. 3. Profile pictures take days to upload (if you change it). 4. You don't get notifications often, usually it takes like 10-20 minutes or you don't get them at all. It also has this very annoying glitch or bug, where you can't change the ""favourite color"" üòê",
Great app but the problem is there's a glitch were for the games and filters it says tap it I tap it but it still doesn't work please fix this but the other things are good great app,
"We need to be able to delete photos to where they aren't seen on ANY end. It's stupid that you can delete a photo on my end, but the receiver can still see it. And logging in would be a lot easier if we could have the option to set up a password for our child instead of having to go through an adults Facebook. Also, we need to be able to delete chats instead of having a ton of different chats and group chats listed that we can't delete.",
I love this app so much. I have used it all though covid. Love it so so so much. I definitely recommend. Sometimes it could be glitchy but that's like once every 3 months. The only thing I would like if when you had a video it can't be more than 1 minute. Or when someone creates a group chat if you don't wanna be in it it sends a message that would be better. Amazing app. I definitely recommend it. Its for all ages really. You can add people from face book. If you get another app you stupid....,
"This app is glitchy and is missing reasonable controls. I installed this so my daughter could message family members. Aside from sleep function there's not really any controls. I wish there was a way to remove the video calling and photo functionality. I hate that I am unable to just simply add people to her friends list, only a random selection of friends show up on the parent dashboard. I can't even add her dad as a contact because the app keeps glitching. This app needs a total overhaul.",
"I am a kid who is using this app, and it's really good! Here are some suggestions!: 1. Please add screen sharing. It would be a lot easier to show what you are talking about in a game or in general! 2. Make it so the call doesn't disconnect when I enter a game. It only happens with my cousin so it might be her McDonald's wifi, if its not then it's her tablet because it doesn't disconnect with anyone else. 3. Make it so you can save videos. That's all have a lovely day/night!!üòò",
"It's okay, but I believe you should be able to see their chat history from the parents phone. Also, sometimes it asks me to approve when they're already friends with the person. At one point, they had to be a friend of mine then if changed and can be anyone. Don't necessarily care for that. Overall, good!",
It sometimes works other times it will say no internet connection even when I have full bars. When people send me Images or videos either they don't load or I have to restart my phone to make them load. Overall I feel that this app is unreliable for FaceTime and Images.,
"This is such a great thing!!! Everything is so nice to adding friends and having fun! I love how you can call eachother and play at the same time! I love the minigames,drawing and beyond! This fills me with joy when i see my friends, its like a virtual playdate! You can chat with friends and its really easy to add people to your list! You can call whenever and theres no adds! The things that change your look like the cat face and so much more the face things are amazing there is so much detail!",
"Great app! It's great for playing games and calling in both the way of being able to play games from the app while calling, and being able to play games like ROBLOX without crashing!Just wish there was a way to give more freedom(allowing gifs from the device, not just app). It would be nice that the profile picture was changeable from the Gallery, not just taking a picture. Otherwise it's a pretty nice app!",
"It is a very nice app. It has a simple user interface and easy to use. It is even cool that a new photo filter is added always. There are also some games which is good and there is also an option for video call. We can also do group chats and can change our profile photo. With all these facilities, I saw that the performance of this app is really good and I would recommend this app to others. Keep it up.üôÇ",
It isn't letting me add adult family members that I am already Facebook friends with so my son can communicate with them.,
"Great app. My 7 year old loves it and it's easy to use and easy to monitor. Parental controls could use some improvement, such as being able to view conversations within the parent control section without having install the kids app on your own device. Also needs a ""Grounded"" button where you can instantly put the app to sleep without having to alter the 'sleep' times.",
Great app but can u make it where on tablets it looks the same as phones thx,
The messages are great I just hate when I'm on a call with my friends on Roblox my screen will go black then it comes back then freeze and go black again but hey it's a great app,
I love this app!! It really helps me understand how real messenger and other social media apps are. There are fun games and create groups.,
"So I don't have a phone, so this is the only way to communicate because other friends have it. And whenever I call one of my friends, the audio will go in and out so I can't hear half of the sentence. Another problem is that there is no warning button when you click sign out. So I got logged out for accidentally tapping that button. Ad I you don't know your parents Facebook, it will take a while to get logged in. Please fix this problem, because then I could give a 4 or five star rating.",
Whenever I try playing with my cousins recently messenger just keeps making my screen go black.,
This app is ok but j don't like how when I kept roasting my friend he roasted me and I did back and then every msg I would send him it wouldn't go through and would just say sent not delivered and nothing is wrong on his end so fix it please then j will leave a good review. But on the other hand it is good because you can report and add anyone who you want.,
"In some recent update, the sleep time controls stopped working reliably. It remains unable to send even during hours that were specified as outside of sleeping hours, where before it was working as expected. It is now necessary to turn it on and off manually. In addition, it would be great if there was a way to limit the number of times a friend can send with no response or call with no answer, with a cooling off period before they can try again. Also, could the ring tone be made configurable?",
Nice app I love talking to friends and family but WHY CAN'T YOU DELETE WORDS once I was texting to a family member and because of auto correct I got D*c* instead of lick so please change that. Thanks‡º∫bye‡ºª,
"I was trying to make an account but everytime I try to create it, it keeps telling me an error happened, it might be a glitch but I don't know, please fix this.",
I love it but messenger kid is down and also messenger and Facebook anything which Facebook owns is clearly down around the world so that's why I'm not using it I call someone everyday but now I can't today but this is really good so everybody should get it maybe tomorrow because it's still down so don't bother getting it right now but you can get in hopefully one hour bye,
"I like this app but recently (in the last 6 months or so) my family and I have not been receiving notifications. You have to actually click on the app to see them and even then they don't even show up for hours. I've also had a problem with pictures not being received, pictures not showing up properly, etc. I know this is not just my phone because it's been happening to many of my family. I've checked the settings and tried everything to fix it up I've come to the conclusion it's an app problem",
"I personally like it but something i dont like is that it doesnt always notify me when i get a text, but its okay-ish, could be better",
"This app is fine but I don't like how you can't delete messages that's very irritating. My friends even say I would like if that could be changed and we can actually delete. Other then else there's nothing wrong with the app just that little issue. Also after a while whenever I want to send a message it says ""unable to send"" that's really getting on my nerves and the way I can fix it is by redownloading it",
"This app is very well made, but it's very laggy. When I call people it will pick up any noise and either have perfect audio or it will glitch and echo very loudly. The notifactations are usefull and it lets me know if someone has sent a message or tried to call me. I do use this app very often and I can say it's a good app. Edit: also when I try to use the games they are laggy. It's also very laggy with the audio on the filters when you're on a call.",
"I'm super frustrated over the fact that my son use to us this app all the time. I went to log him on, on another device and it will not let me sign him in says ""login error"" or ""ask an adult for help."" ND brings me right back to the sign in page. I've even tried making a new account, changing passwords and resetting devices. PLEASE FIX THIS. as of now, it's useless. We used to LOVE this app.",
"‚ù§Love this app and highly recommend it! üíôWorks perfect on both my smartphone and on our Samsung tablet! üíöAlso, I love that I was able to put both of my daughters on there, and that it's so easy for them to swap between their profiles.üíõ They especially love the abundant sticker selection, being able to video call and really love being connected with their family and friends! üòªüò∫",
This app is really good and it let's kids connect with friends online and let's parents get some time to work so I really recommend it to kids and parentsü¶Ñüíï,
They couldnt make groups with other kids if there not friends and that you cant change the theme like on a ipad you cant on a phone.,
"The app doesn't tell you when someone messages you .. several apps, several accounts, and they all don't get any notifications.",
I love this app so I can stay in touch with my friends and family üòÄ I had this app before and I loved it so my mom saint me up and I'm so happy üòÅüòÅüòÅ bye üíï,
"My daughter was able to do video chats with her cousin and take and send photos for like 2 days, then it wouldn't work, now she cannot receive any voice recordings, photos or videos. The only thing it is useful for now is texting and sending the (very limited) stickers. This app has several details to work out.",
"Very safe for kids, but the loading is atrocious. It's almost impossible to have a proper phone call, and don't even think about trying to play the mini games with your friends. When it comes to the texting it takes a diligent eye to notice when your friends text you. The one good thing is that certain emojis like ‚òÉÔ∏èüéâ make cool stuff happen. Oh and it's very safe for kids.",
"It's amazing and easy to use...I just wish you could save the videos before and after you make them. Quite a few videos I've recorded on it I want to send to certain people who don't use the app, but can't because you can't save videos. Please add this!!!! Will give four stars if you do!! Will give five stars if you add all the filters and special effects that parents have to children's devices/accounts!!!! One more thing, I wish there weren't 'unable to send' messages. Anyway Thanks!!!‚ô°",
"I really used to like the app but now it has to many glitches, first of all when I'm in a call I can exit the app and do other things while still in call, that's good, but my screen keeps flashing black when I do that and I can barely do anything, also the notifications glitch and I don't get them so often I'm convinced it's a new feature not a bug, and sometimes when my friend is trying to text me the messages won't send, and I'm pretty much sure it's nothing on my end.",
"Messenger kids is a great app for kids to chat and call! It sometimes can be a bit glitchy though but you and you friends can still chat! I absolutely LOVE messenger kids as it can be amazing for kids who are long distance! You can face time and call and you can text and draw pictures to your friends and family! Me and my cousin have messenger kids and we always chat on it EVERY DAY now! Even though it's sometimes a bit glitchy, at least it is way better than nothing! And I insist you need it!!!",
"Messenger Kids is very nice, but the one thing that it has a problem with is the videos. They sometimes won't even let me see them, the screen will just turn black. Sometimes though, I get to see the first 2 seconds or less. This is my third time redownloading the app, so I can see the videos. PLEASE fix this.",
great app I get to chat with a lot of my friends and other people to! the only reason I give it 4 stars is beacause the filters aren't the best.,
"It's okay. It would better if the parent controls on fb were easier to navigate. I have a hard time adding adults ex. aunts and a grandparent that have just come on facebook. I could add adults easier a few years ago. The app itself has no problems, it runs well and it protects the children. I get a summary of who he talked to and I have to approve his friends not him.",
"Whenever somebody tries to tap on call it does nothing, and doesn't let you play most of the games because of this.",
An amazing app to communicate with friends and family but it doesn't have all the emojis fix this and those 4 stars will be five ‚≠ê in no time,
I love this app! It lets me connect with all my friends and even though it can be glitchy at times it is really worth the download. Why? Because not only can you text and video call but there is so much more to! You can grow your own pet and even play mini games in the call or in text message! You can also mute yourself if need be in call which can be very usefull at times!,
I love this app when it works. But reason number 1 is that you can't save videos. 2 the videos when sent are terrible quality. 3 when they hit the take picture button when in a call it doesn't always tell you . 4 sometimes when they call after the decline button was hit it still rings so you have to listen to it until it stops. 5 when you try to send a voice recording it says you can't while in a call even though there is no call happening.,
"It's a pretty good app. Only thing I dont like about it is that, I'm having to uninstall the app and reinstall it becuz it WOULD NOT let me type ANYTHING, and it is REALLY annoying. Also I'm not a big fan of the whole ""not being able to delete messages thing"". And 3. When I change my profile pictures sometimes (like the current one I have now) it will flip my picture sideways on the app, and I dont like that it does that. So ifyall could fix that then it would make a pretty good difference. Lol",
Great! But some kids can't read yet. My children live in 2 homes each and this app is amazing for their communication. Its helps maintain their relationships without taking my phone all the time. The ONLY downside to it is that some kids cant read yet. But they have to learn. Maybe add a feature that reads and highlights each word? Like how virtual school does as it reads the words to the kids.,
"The reason I only gave stars is because it does a weird glitch to me. Every now and then when I try to make a video with music it will not let me send it. It also doesn't let me send normal videos. It is really upsetting because the main thing I do on this app is send videos to my friends. It gives me a green screen when I try to send the video. Besides that, it is a great app but I really hope you could fix this. Thanks!",
"Great app and I reccomend, especially for parents who want a safe way for kids to text. However, I do have a couple complaints. One, my chat bubble colors don't work. I don't even see an option to do then. Two, I rarely get alerts for messages. Unless I want to miss messages, I have to constantly open the app and check to see if I have any new messages.",
It is a good app to stay in touch with your friends and family some times for me it will hang up overall it is a good app high recommended,
I love this app because u can talk with your friends and family,
I think that kids messager is a great app. I use it every day. One of the bad things is that when you are on a video chat you can not share your screen which I think that you should be able to do. For a long time I could not pick pictures out of my gallery. I think that they should also add a place like snapchat that you can have a story and post pictures and captions along with videos. But other than that it is a great app that I love.,
"Can't even get through the initial setup! A prompt keeps popping up saying ""Account Creation Failure.. something went wrong..."" As I read through some of the reviews, it seems like many people are experiencing the same problem for a while now without a response, solution or feedback. Don't even bother with this app, it's a total complete waste of time. I created a FB just for this reason & then ended up in a frustrating cycle of trying over, and over again to set it up. Just Skype or Zoom.",
I would say it's a good app but it's bad for it to process very good but sometimes it just doesn't respond...,
"This app 8s horrible!!!! Why because everything I call my friends or try to send them something the app doesn't let me send it. AND Alsooo the FaceTime it freezes then when I hang up it just continues with the video chat, and if I call back it would just freeze until right after I hang up it unfreeze. Therefore I will give it a 1 STAR",
"It's a good app and I can call and text my friends but I won't get the notifications anymore so I always miss their calls. The old videos I sent them, I cannot see anymore and take forever to load. Lastly, in the middle of calling my friends the app starts beeping and my friend goes silent and the silence goes on for about 10 mins, and then I have to hang up.",
"I liked it just fine until the notifications stopped telling me when someone is trying to message me, but it obviously shows when someone wants to call me or video chat with me. The first couple of months I had this app' I had no problems. Although it's a fun app with the stickers, fliters etc. However this is a annoying problem.",
"Worked great until recently. My MIL had to create a new Facebook account a month or so ago because her original one got hacked and is unrecoverable. We have been trying ever since to add her as a contact for our kids, but have been unable to do so. She doesn't show up in my list of available contacts to add, and when I send an invite link or request from any of the kids, it gives me an error when I try to approve it. And there is no way to contact anyone for support üôÑ",
"This app is really glitchy, when I call with my friends my screen always turns black and I can't touch anything, when someone sends me multiple pictures I can't see the other pictures, it really annoys me, when I use filters I can't do what it tells me to do. overall I don't recommend please fix.",
"When ever I tried to save a photo it would say ""something went wrong"" I restarted my phone, unistalled it and re-installed it, that didn't work so I updated it. That still didn't work. I wish I could've rated this 5 star but dew to this problem I won't it's very annoying I hope you'll fix this üòÄ Otherwise this is a great app.",
"Honestly, one of the best messengers for kids out there. No ads, just smooth video call, with a few glitches. I usually use it to call my friends and cousins, but plz fix the glitches where it can here the other side for 3-4 minutes.",
I like it but it never tells me when some one is online correctly and they need new colors and ever time 8 click on a different photo it always sh9ws me the one before witch gets really annoying and you can't edit other people's profile like have a display name only show up on your screen if that was added that would be cool please f8x it that would be awesome and you should be able to get a notification everytime someone blocks you so you know why your messages won't go through that would help,
"Messenger kids is a good and safe app for your kids to message with other friends or family. You can try new filters, and you can play games. But lately I've been having trouble managing this app. My child has been coming up to me to approve a request but no request pops up. This has been happening with the same contact for a while. And today it said that there was an error of some sort. Until then a 3 star would suit me.",
My child loves messenger but she wishes that there is a option to make videos and post them and there is a feed on messenger with comments likes and followers and you can add sounds from importing a video please add that!,
"Amazing app for keeping in touch with my kid, but the volume is ridiculously low. Can barely hear it, unless you are in a very quiet area. Any noise around you at all and you can't hear a thing. Please fix the sound issue ASAP! App would be flawless if sound was better",
"It is a very good app for kids to message their friends, and their aren't any people (predators) that can contact them without parents acceptance",
this app is very good for calling my friends BUT EVERY TIME I TOUCH MY PHONE IT KEEPS TURNING OFF AND ITS SO ANNOYING,
a great way to protect your children from predators highly effective and recommended - father of 5,
"I wish the design was had more than one colour and that you don't have to scroll so much to find a contact. I wish it was built for kids of all ages and that I would stop getting multiple notifications for the same message. Also, I wish that the app could do audio calls, not just video calls. Besides that, it's a pretty good app and works quite well.",
Can't send YouTube shorts or gifs to my siblings and doesn't have backgrounds for my siblings only I have it since I'm 13 this app can improve,
It's a great app but I don't have the camra off button at the top,
Neutral. There are very limited number of games to play so if you're wanting to engage in some games with younger children they are very boring. There are only three drawing options a day. Example a dog a donut and a dolphin. And that's it. Also during chat it froze several times using face features. It's simple to operate but eventually it would be nice to see more. Has potential but it's not there yet.,
"(Coming from reviewers daughter.) This app is alright but during the video calls it seems to make your screen go pitch black a lot. Please, fix",
A very good app and very safe for kids the only two issues are I let my child add friends for herself but I still have to add them for her and also I added two more friends for her and they didn't show up. It they fixed this problem then this app would be perfect. Also when ever she calls some of her friends the audio cuts out please fix these bugs.,
"It's fun and cool but there is this very annoying thing... When you send a lot of photos the same time (they are sticked together), and you click like a different picture, it goes to the first one! PLEASE FIX THIS!",
"Love it! Greta way to talk to friends, and communicate with family members.",
"It's worked fine thus far. I don't get notifications when my son gets a message as advertised. Also, once you choose a picture from your gallery there is no way to choose a new one unless you snap a live pic. Video quality is good. No complaints there.",
"The app has been glitchy for months. First photos wouldn't show or send, and now they are working but video calls don't work. They freeze and there is no sound to the people I'm calling. I tried to report a technical problem but following the online directions there is only a place to report a problem person not a technical problem. We have uninstalled, updated, and restarted multiple times. It just will not work.",
"This app is really good, but sometimes when you try to send a message to someone it will say "" unable to send "" in yellow font, and it will keep doig that for like 10 minutes, and sometimes when you are in the middle of a video call the app will hang up itself, the filters and games are also very stupid, but other than that it is a really good app.",
"There currently is an issue with this app - Every time the kid sends a message it gives an annoying ""POP."" All sounds on the phone are off, we have tried rebooting the phone, we have turned off all notifications, we have reinstalled the app, but it still overrides Android's settings and gives a POP. Even when an external audio device (bluetooth or hardwired earphone) are attached, the POP still comes out of the phone. Facebook, please look in to and fix this.",
"This app is so fun! It does take up a lot of storage, but you can easily clear it out by going to settings on your phone and hitting storage, when it shows the apps, click messenger kids then hit clear data. It will not delete the app but it will free up all the storage it takes up. üòÅ I also have ahad the problem with it only text one letter, and making me hit the text box again, but if you update messenger kids it will stop. Hope this was helpful!!",
It's perfect for ages 7 to 15. It's really fun and easy,
"Messenger kids is a great app! It has minigames, funny filters, cute stickers, and more! There are 2 problems I've noticed, one problem, I'll be on a call with my friend playing roblox or something, and all of the sudden makes this beeping noise and then it hangs up. Sometimes there is no beeping and it still hangs up. The other problem is when I'm on the phone with somebody and I leave the app, my phone goes black and then it goes normal, over and over, please fix this messenger!",
Love the app but I wish there was more colour selection for the messenging maybe you could add a colour wheel but that's just my opinion,
"The app is great - WHEN it works. Every time my kids want to use it, we get notifications that they have been logged out, and an error when I log them back in. We daily have to uninstall and re-download the app to get it working again - for that moment anyway. The next time, it logs them back out and has the same issue again. It has been doing this for months and we just can't seem to figure it out. It is really frustrating. It never did this before, but started within the last 4 - 5 months.",
This app really needs a way to turn off calls from certain people when they keep repetedly calling and you cant talk. Or for you to be able to apear offline when you still want to use your device for other things. We ended up having to block someone for this reason and it caused a huge family drama. I am also in the middle of researching how to remove contacts from my daughter's account. You either cant do it or it is not easily done. This app really needs an upgrade with some easier features.,
"I have been trying to ""authorize device"" for my child's messenger kids app for a week. It just keeps looping back to the authorize screen after every attempt. I have restarted, Uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared cache, etc. multiple times. There seems to be no fix or work around at this time. And there is no way to report it to FB to get a solution. Please fix this issue. There are countless people having this same problem. This started around the 21st of September and hasn't been fixed yet.",
"This is good face app for kids but I have a request and a few problems about this app 1st of all, my child tried to make a profile picture from her screen shots and they only have a flip option not even filters for the profile, please add those features, and there are multiple disconnects between my child and her friends calls, even though both connections are fine. The videos they send can't really be more than one minute. Please add more filters that might not be as weird...",
"I keep signing in and uninstalling and reinstalling and entering the authentication code and it just loops back around to asking me to sign in again!! I went to my phone carrier store and they helped me to look up and install an old version of the app. It works with the old version installed, a few glitches but it does what I need it for! So this current app does not work and you need to look up and install an old version if you want to use messenger kids! Please fix this app!!",
"It's good my daughter loves it. As a adult I think it could have a few adjustments, alot of family who are friends with my daughter have mentioned it's harder to use then normal messenger on their side as they don't get notifications. I'd like as the person who set up her account to be able to log in like anyone else. I'd also love if they made a PC version to use on laptop as my daughter doesn't have a tablet or phone, which is the main thing. But it works to keep kids connected",
"Many times I try to call my child (audio and video), and it does not ring on his end. I have tried to troubleshoot on my device, on his device, with the parent dashboard.... nothing works. It is the app.",
"The app is great i just dont really like the fact that you can't send links and you can't share videos, because if you want to send a cool video or song to your friends you cant. Those are the only things that put it on 7/10 instead of 9/10. Overall its a good appüëç 7/10",
"Speaking as a child, I LOVE this app so far. It is incredibly easy for me to speak to my parents and friends in other countries. I like the features, and for those saying this app is too ""kid-ish"", bruh, did u read the title? It cross-platforms okay - can't transfer my data which is a bit annoying but not a big issue. People saying its complicated and hard to use but i disagree. everyone seems annoyed that you must log in with facebook but i see why its necessary. Overall a nice app. üëçüëå",
"I love the app so I can talk to my friend's, but there are two problems. One: My friends always get an update before me and whenever I go to see if I can update it, it doesn't need updating. Two: Could you please, make a delete button for text, and videos. Because whenever I go to text or send a weird video of me to my other friend, they use it against me so please fix something about it! Overall messenger kids is a very good social app for friends! So please make a delete button, thanks!",
"I just downloaded the app for my daughter yesterday 4/2, to be able to see and talk with her friends and family. She too has become obsessed and at first I thought it was the cutest thing seeing her interact with everyone but now, the constant notifications on MY phone are driving me crazy and it's very annoying. My phone has NEVER gone off with so many notifications. Please consider making an option where we as parents can silent or turn off notifications from our own device.",
The app is so nice üò∫ I love it so much my 5 yer old loves to messenge his grandma and grandpa so much He loves it so much üòçüòçüòç,
"The new update is horrible, there was only a couple good filters that I liked and were silly, now there is only 1 and it's not even that good. The game filters don't work on call either anymore, same thing with the filters that you tap. I can't play games and call either. It's super laggy and pixely all the time too. I would recommend but it's just not worth the storage space to be honest.",
i cant make an account!! Its been 5 days since i tried sooooo many time!! I also watched on YT on how to set up this app. But it is still not working!!!,
"Good app. But I wish that I didn't have to have your mom approve when u put a code in... Though I HATE sleep mode. When it lets me get on, I CANT TEXT OR CALL. So I can't respond to friends until 9:00. And it would be nice if it had some ringtones to choose from. And when I have my AirPods on and someone calls me, the audio doesn't transfer! I'm not sure if it's the manufacturer's fault or what. Please fix these! And more colors would be nice. Other than that, perfection.",
I love this app to talk to my friends and everything but I have one problem whenever I try to touch the screen for a game or a filter it doesn't work please fix,
"I am giving this 4 stars because my daughter likes to send a lot of videos and pictures, they are taking up half the storage on my daughters tablet. And I can't delete the texts and videos on my end. And you can't connect Bluetooth for video calls,but other then those things it's a great app for all age kids.",
"Its a perfect online platform for kids to play with each other, it works well, the picture options are nice qnd its just a over all good platform for kids",
I really like Messenger Kids but there are a few things I would change. 1. One of my contacts keeps calling me constantly and the mute conversation only works on text messages. Please add a button so no one can call you for a little while. * 2. The audio is sometimes really good in calls but then other times you can't even understand the person who you are calling. 3. I can't call anyone with Bluetooth. * It could be like a one person thing like in settings for a chat so they can't call you,
"this is a really good and safe way for kids to see eachother, no matter how far away they are they can also stay in touch. but your probably wondering ""why only 4 stars if its so good"" there are games you can play but they get quite boring, so i have some recommendations, 1 there should be 1 or more online games and you can play with the other kids who use messenger kids, also it would be cute if the kids could type a destription about themselves so other kids know a bit about them",
"They don't have an option to connect bluetooth or put another person on speaker. If someone breaks their headphones and now a part of it is stuck in the audio jack, how can they communicate through call or facetime? Secondly there is not an option to use a filter or a photo from gallery as a profile picture. I also don't like the fact that you can't delete messages. If there was an offending typo in one of your messages that you didn't mean, I would like to delete it.",
"I really enjoy this app but I wish there was more filters to choose from instead of taking a filter away and then putting it back up as a ""new"" filter. Also I would really like it if u could save videos because I used to take riding lessons and my parents would send me videos and only a couple photos and I can only save the pictures. I'll give it a 5 star at least once u can save videos I've been wanting that change for over a year.",
"It is very amazing for kids to communicate bit the problems I have are it won't let me send my texts at random times like earlier my friend texts me and I try to reply back and it said unable to send and I did try and fix it but it didn't work and my app would fall asleep and it may just be my parents doing this but as I am clarifying now, I am not for sure if it's the app or my parents. But if you can, please fix these bugs. Thank you for your time.",
"great app! my daughter would absolutely love to see a feature like a story, where you can 'post' a little video showing where you are in your day, or keeping all of your friends updated! but all in all an amazing app!",
Look this app is fantastic. It has fun challenges to do with friends it has would you rathers and it own unique touch I have been meaning to post this review for a little bit now and let's just say if it doesn't improve it is not great. You see before it used to let you choose the color of you texts and it had a different layout now it resembles Messenger. I do not like that. Also unless you are actively in the app you can not receive calls. That defeats 50 percent of it's purpose.,
It sucks i try to call somone and it asks me if i allow it to use my camra for the call i click allow and nithing happens,
I love this app it's amazing but it's just the bugs,
"This app used to be great, now it's not, I've tried to download it and I get to where I put my child's name and birthday, then I click enter and it says can't create an account, it's been like this for weeks EDIT: it is now months later and the problem still hasnt been fixed!!! EDIT#2 : IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR AND I STILL CANNOT CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR MY CHILD!",
"I don't know if it is my phone but when I tried creating a kids account it's says something went wrong, try again. So I did like 10 times and never worked, what should I do? My friend has it and it's working fine for them...",
Most of the time all it does is beep beep. It never calls out. Doesn't ring at all on the person you're trying to chat with,
"Hardly ever works. Very frustrating. Constantly have to update to be able to actually call. 90% of the time never connects and never rings when someone trys to call. But will get a ""missed call"" notification. But wont connect when calling back. Tried uninstalling and reinstall and now cant log back in. I get error code every time. My kids love the filters but not a reliable app for them to be able to call me or their friends.",
"I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its so useful for my 11 year old and my 9 year old! They love that they can message there friends and family! They also love that the can send photos and videos with fun filters! Why I love this app is because I can control there contacts and see who the have talked to most. My 11 year old plays with her neighbor and they say ""can you play?"" and they often respond quickly. This is a completely FREE app to use. There is only 1 thing I don't like about this app its because if you have it on your phone and they have it on there iPad your phone will keep dinging and it gets old, but that's really all I don't like!",
I'm having the same issue noted in several of the recent reviews. I'm tested it with different devices and it's the same issue. I enter my password to authorize log in and it promptly takes me break to the login screen. My FB account lists the login in the list of logged devices but it's NOT working. This has been happening since Saturday. I reached out to the developer and reported the problem to FB and no response. Very disappointed.,
"Its a pretty good chatting app for kids, but i have a few problems: One of them is that you can't delete any messages, or edit them. So if you make a mistake or send the wrong photo, you cant change it. Another problem is that you can't delete contacts. You can only block them, but blocking them won't remove them off your screen. You also can't download any photos to your profile pick, you have to take one, which is aggravating. Im deducting two stars because of this, but its a great app.",
I loved this app. The only bad thing is that lately when a group of photos are sent if I want to tap on a photo in the group it brings me to the first one sent and I can't see any others (other then the small overview) I use text now that I don't need Messengers kids but when u had it it worked very well,
"Really good way for me to text my friends but there's one problem, so on iPhone in the your options area there is an ability to change the theme. But on Samsung there is no option to do that and not everyone has iPhone I don't know if its just my phone or if every Samsung user can't have that option in settings",
Really upset. It keeps kicking me out and like old messages from like a year ago keep popping up. Really glitch and overall bad,
I love this app!! it's so good 4 kids you can face time too! You can block people if they're being rude or swearing and if you feel uncomfortable you can block that person thats making you uncomfortable! I love this app and i hope you guys will like it too! I would definitely recommend this app 4 you or your kids! Its a great way to connect with your friends and family if they live far away,
Update. Thanks for fixing the login issue. Now can you fix the others? It's not letting me add adults. Just gets stuck on a loop and the approve or delete doesn't go away and the other adult isn't getting the notification to be added. And then I cant find them to resend the request or delete current request!!! My son wants to be able to speak to his dad who is a truck driver. Please fix * I can't get passed the authorize device. I even tried with a one time password... On two different devices.,
"It's weird. Back when I didn't have a phone number or data and such, this was what I used. Cause I had a tablet and not a phone... Ya. I was about 12 at the time. Me and my friend would call and text back and forth, but it was annoying that there weren't any funny gifs. Everything is tuned towards little kids. Good app overall, but definitely room for improvement.",
"I like the app and most features. However, their accessibility options are severely limited. There is no way to have disabled kiddos communicate if they can't read. It won't read any texts out loud and I'd love to see a feature that can help disabled children spell, or voice to text. It would be really helpful for my disabled kiddo that can't really use the app.",
"This used to be a great app to communicate with my kids through my old phones that only have Wifi. However, now I cannot log in through the Google play store version of the messenger kids app. After authenticating my account, it always immediately routes me back to the log in screen. I have tried this on multiple phones with the same results. Yet, when I downloaded it from the Galaxy play store, it worked immediately, without any issues.",
Myself and a number of friends are all experiencing the same issue of not being able to get past the login page. I enter the correct password for my account and it instantly takes me back to login. I have tried the one time password and entered that correctly but still facing same issue. Uninstalling and reinstalling hasn't helped. It is like I'm logged in in the background as I get notifications for messages my child receives but cannot open them on the app so it doesn't work at all for me.,
If I could score it lower I would. It refuses to let me log in. Keeps on asking for adult account verification. I give it the password I do the one-time password and it just keeps kicking me back in a constant loop. It's not the device. It does the same thing on multiple devices. Your product sucks. I've never had a more frustrating time trying to set up something to speak with my children.. this is the absolute most piss poor app I've ever seen,
It's good but I wish it had chat themes like messages and the video time is only 1 minute so it's hard to make videos,
"Amazing app and very safe for Kids and so so fun,and pls add more games for kids :) and btw there are NO ads, like Zero ads BIG FAT ZERO !..... Thanks.",
I'm very happy with this app. It's safe and I have had no problems except that you can send bad words. I know that if a child is to see a text like that they should report it but it would be nice if you could block out bad words. I haven't had a personal experiences with bad texts on the app I just don't understand why you can't use the poop emoji but you can send bad words. Lovely app I really appreciate that you can personalize it. Would recommend.,
"It is ok. Would be nice if you could fix the sleep mode timings. I allow my 6yo to use it over the weekend, which is Friday after school, Saturday and Sunday. It gets locked on Sunday at dinnertime. How much easier would it be for a parent to be able to lock each day individually, so good!! Also, I am absolutely tired of setting the time, only to go back in and take the lock off. When I go back in, I have to reset the time again, why can't it just stay the same as what I originally set?",
"Great app in the beginning. I couldn't type so I had to press the bar multiple times to get to. Fun filters and love the video call. I want to have the contact list of people who were near them again, so I can talk to them easier without getting their code. Overall great app",
Love it it's a great way to communicate with family and friends üòÑ I love the games u can play when u FaceTime üòâüòÅ,
This app is great! Love the quality and it's easy to use I can chat with my cousin or even friends from school ect. Theres constantly new features and games on the app for everyone to enjoy theres not really any flaws except I cant change my profile picture and its pretty annoying because sometimes my parent/guardian is using their phone and I cant change it when I get the phone sometimes it doesn't even work on either then after a few days the ability to change it come back randomly it's great.,
"I love the app. I can chat with my friends and call them, there are games and such but.. there are 2 issues for me. There is unable to send and it sometimes happen to me friends or me, and there is this thing that happened today. When someone called me I answered, but I couldn't hear them, turns out they didn't receive the answer. It irritated me so much. Please fix the bugs, otherwise I love the app!",
"I am having a lot of trouble with this app. It worked fine for both kids' devices but now one child can't video call. All incoming and outgoing calls fail after lasting exactly 21 seconds. I have tried restarting the device, checking for updates, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. HELP!",
We've used the app for a few years. All of a sudden it has logged 2 of us out randomly and will not allow us to log back in. Just continuous loop back to re enter password. We've tried contacting developer with no response at all. We've tried uninstalling many times and still no good. Very frustrated to have no customer service.,
"Love it, but we very regularly have issues where the screens don't show up properly. The kids have to hang up and call each other back. Which doesn't work a lot, because then they inevitably can't get back in touch and end up crying because it isn't working right. Very frustrating. When it works, it os great. But there are a lot of server/connection bugs that need to be fixed. I'm about to delete the app, bc I'm so sick of hearing my kid cry when it doesn't work.",
It's a good app but I'm trying to add other people that are not kids. My kids have step brothers and sisters and couple of them are little older but it seems to me that I can't find their picture to add for them to message Then. I know that they are friends on my account but it's also telling them to make an Kid account. When I go through all the steps the very end one says invite Other but there is no done button.,
"This app is amazing! I can get in contact with my friends and family efficiently. This is really fun with all of the little stickers, camera add-ons and small minigames you can play with your friend(s). There is only 1 problem I have came across of, and that is when I want to change my profile picture. There is the option of taking a picture, but I was trying to get a photo from my gallery for my profile picture but it doesn't work on the phone I currently have (that's android) iPhones work only.",
We installed it. Set it up. And.. we dont get any notifications of incoming messages or calls. When we tried video call to a friend. Video was not working for neither side.... how is it possible that those easy options are not working on such an app??? SO disappointed,
"Keeps on asking for adult verification on multiple devices after entering correct credentials. There is no option to contact support, I've unrestricted access on Family Link account and also checked for any awkward permission settings in the FB app. Super frustrating, no easy way to connect to support. No notification of why I fall into a perpetual verification loop. Poorly designed support path. Android 11(+).",
"This app is great, but I would really, really, REALLY WANT the ability to record the video calls or at least allow apps (like screen recorders or call recorders) to record the calls. Messenger calls are able to be recorded by some apps but not Messenger Kids. Could you please change that? There are just so many special or important moments during call that are forgotten at times. So could you please make it to where you can record calls? Thanks!üôÇ",
It used to be fun but it has alot of bugs,
dumb! the filters are terrible and it's not fun at all. I'd rather not have it then have this as the only option for video chatting and texting I also don't like the profile picture options. I wish you could choose a picture from your gallery.. At least you can text. I would say this app SHOULD be for 6 to 9 year olds instead,
It's a great app definitely could use some things to be a fantastic app with some definite changes to the child getting older and content like GIF and being able to send outside content in control over who the child can friend if a parent is not link to the other parent would be great if could be a way for both parents to okay it without having the connection & not being able to send just simple stickers to your children that are standard in your keyboard,
Cannot connect to Ihome Bluetooth headphones,
"One of kids has this installed and with no issues. But for whatever reason, this version is looping the guardian login requirement. Even reinstalling, clearing data, and trying both email and phone number it still loops a login credentials for the parent. For now, it's unusable. Hope it gets resolved soon. Was trying to make an account for my daughters birthday for her new phone.",
"This app is great! Its an amazing way to connect with cousins, friends, and parents! It has so many great games to play, However it does have its issues. Lately I've been trying to change my favorite color but it has been failing every time. I don't know if this has to do with my device or anything, but yeah. But over all its an amazing app and I 100% recommend it!",
"We used the app for months without issue, but for several days have been locked out. It's stuck at the screen asking for parental authentication. I've entered my password a hundred times, tried a one-time password and the alternate login option, deleted and re-downloaded the app, and applied the latest update. It's BROKEN.",
Yes same issues and didn't know anyone was having this problem. I log in over and over and over again keeps taking me back to lig in. I know for a fact it's the correct password but tried to change it but same problem. This is very very frustrating. It's very inconvenient when this is how my child plays and communicates with hey school friends especially when school is out. Please fix this and teach out ton your users on the process and progress!!!!!! This sucks,
My little sister loves this app. She texts her friends on here all the time. But I think that the kids should be able to have stories for their friends to see. Mainly because then all their friends can see what they are up to without them having to send the picture to everyone so then only the people who want to see it can. And in the camera there should be a botton for them to click that shows all the previous filters that were featured on the app.,
It is so much fun you will enjoy every moment of your child when they get to call there friends without your phone and if you are worried you can you the messages,
"I like the fact that they can message to friends in a similar fashion to regular FB, however it is not easy to use and customize. Adding a second parent was not easy and since my husband owns one child and I the other, I only get updates on one. I can only approve or suggest friends for one even though I'm listed as a parent on both. There should also be a feature if you want to view your child's messages since it is linked to you. Otherwise I like it.",
Please make it so you can save photos and videos to your divice from messenger kids. I make amazing videos and then they are gone with all the texts. I'll raise my rating once you make it so we can save photos and mainly MAKE IT SO WE CAN SAVE VIDEOS. Some of my videos won't let me watch past a certain time or the audio stops working. Also you could make there be a way to see messages from a certain date. Fix the videos now I want to watch my friend's and my videos. The calls are glichy.,
"I am frustrated. I have been trying to set this account up for a week now. I thought I was doing something wrong but after looking the reviews, its clearly not just me. The constant ""parent validation "" loop is beyond frustrating. I have tried stopping the app, re-installing it, using multiple devices and nothing. Furthermore, on my children's device, I am stuck at a stage where I can only request friends and it just keeps sending me back to the start!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨. Fix this immediately",
"Trying to reinstall this app on new device, and after using it for years I'm suddenly denied access while trying to log in via my parent account! Keep getting message saying ""the user is not allowed to log into this app"". How hard can it be to make an app that actually works üôÑ",
It's in a constant loop! I login or use the one time pass code and it takes me back to the login constantly. I've used this on all the devices and now the app doesn't work on anything. It now requires me to authorize devices by logging in but now won't take my login information and takes me right back to same page over and over again. Super frustrating!! Please fix this!,
When I got sent images the app worked fine until a few days later when I clicked on the tile that had the images sent the app would go black and refresh. I found this very frustrating. It's also very annoying that I don't get a notificaition whenever someone texts me. And if I EVER DO it's always an hour or two later. I always have to go check and when I find texts that I was NOT NOTIFIED OF it is very frustraiting. Please fix this otherwise I am going to find another app.,
I love it it's kid friendly mind me I'm 9 but it truly is kid friendly I can chat to friends send cool and cute emojis to all my friends make group chats and call people completely free I personally think it is amazing for kids it had mini games and more it teaches kids how to take care or them and othersy using there messenger kids pet I definitely recommend this app for all ages you can also have perental controls or your children there is lots of filters to schoose from definitely recommend ‚ù§,
"No option around camera permissions. I was ok with the app as a way for my daughter to keep in contact with friends until we couldn't bypass camera permissions. If I don't want my child to send pictures, I think an app that's meant to be a safe alternative for kids should have customizable parental controls, which include turning off the camera and/or voice call option. So we uninstalled.",
"It a good and safe app for children to use. The only problem I have right now is that too many times already, when my niece calls/write to me, I do not hear the notifications and have missed multiple calls and messages. I would have to constantly check the messenger to make sure I haven't missed anything and it is frustrating. Until this issue is fixed, my review will stay the same. Please fix!!",
"Currently a 1 star. Was logged out over a week ago. I have rebooted, uninstalled/ reinstalled, used the one time password, changed my password.. I've done it all. I need to have this app on my phone so that I can see what is happening with my kids ad making sure they are safe. Please fix this issue.. also needs to be better and easier to use customer service.",
"This app is pretty good, but I have a few problems 1. Messages take forever to send and my Internet is perfectly fine 2. If I were on a call with my friend if I went on any other app than messenger my screen would start flashing black so every time that happens me and my friend switch to a different app 3. You can't send multiple photos, and videos at once so I would that you can fix all these problems",
"Messenger Kids is a really good app. I have it on my iPad and the notifications work really well. I love how it‚Äôs not just a messenger but has games on it as well. The filters are really cool and creative, I like how there are different varieties of filters every week. But I do have a few suggestions, while calling, could you try to make it so that you can text not only the person you‚Äôre calling but all your other contacts at the same time? And could there be an option to receive notifications when someone goes online? But overall, it‚Äôs a great app for messaging.",
"Use to love the app, but experiencing the same as many others have stated. (Glad its not just me, thought I was going crazy). I was logged out, and cant seem to log back in, just keeps saying logging out and taking me back to re-enter email/password. Have uninstalled, reinstalled, turned internet off, restarted devices. No difference, this has happened to 3 seperate devices.",
"My wife can't get past the account creation screen! It keeps saying that the account creation has failed, please try again. When she tries again, it's the same message that comes up! I tried emailing the developer, and it won't let you send the email! I want this fixed! There is no reason why the developer should not be able to be contacted. How are they supposed to get issues fixed if they're unreachable?!?",
"App is no longer working, for the past 2 weeks I have been unable to log in through my DEVICE or my children's devices. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, changed passwords.. Nothing is working to get past the login page. Very disappointed that the one app that I felt was a safe options for my kids online isn't working anymore. I sincerely hope it's fixed ASAP!",
"So far, I cannot even create an account for either of my children. Not impressed.",
i L O V E it. its great for kids my kids love it to they can talk to me when im gone or somthing but i can figure out how to let my kids send me links,
My child uses this app to call his friends and many others!,
I love this this app my grandma is all the way in Pembroke and I could call her and text her from all the way in Ottawa,
l like messeger kids because it's amazing app for kids and ive had it since i was 6 thia my mom wont let my and my siblings have messenger this is amaxing,
It's good just wish there was more filters and games,
The best thing ever my friends and I constantly use kids messenger it about like normal messenger but kids virson,
Won't let me make account for my son. I even made a new Facebook thinking it was my Facebook but even work on the new one.,
"I can't create a child account with this app,, it's useless",
It will not work for me. It's set up but when I try and search for my son I can't.,
"Absolutely horrible, I cannot even make my child an account.",
This app is an amazing way to connect with friends.,
Good for the kids to comunicate,
Facebook never sent me a code for device authorization. What the **** ??? How can I use this app ???,
was working until it stopped,
its so glitchey and when i ty to find a friend i cant,
The best thing for kids you can view everyting they do,
"At times obtuse, but good tool to keep my kid safe",
Great app for kids to connect easily with their friends. Definitely recommend for younger kids!,
"My daughter keeps getting an error message and cannot send messages. Which was kind of the whole point. No where to send a problem report unless I wanted to email or my mail. Not an option for in the app. No explanation, she can receive messages but not send them. If it was a connection issue I'd imagine it'd stop it both ways. Hoping maybe doing this will get me answers ü§∑",
"The app is great to talk with my family and friends, but I think this app really needs screen sharing features, so I can show videos and games to my friends with ease. I know you can post stuff, but my phone doesn't have screen recording options. So anyways, please add that feature.",
"I love the app! I do have two small update ideas though. For the color feature, keep the colors that are there, but add an optional color choice. For when you send something, if you tap on it, I want to be able to delete the things I send if I want/need to.",
It refuses to let me log in. Keeps on asking for adult account verification. I give it the password I do the one-time password and it just keeps kicking me back in a constant loop. It's not the device. It does the same thing on multiple devices. this is the only way my kids talk to their friends.,
"I like this app but there are a few minor problems. 1) when someone sends a video, the sound does not work 2) it takes a very very very long time to load some activities(I know this is probably something that can't be fixed, it is probably my old phone) Otherwise, it is a great app that I can contact people through.",
"All of a sudden, this application no longer works with the microphone on my son's Samsung tablet. The tablet is only 6 months old, so we can rule out that it has to do with old firmware. The app has microphone permissions so thats not the issue. We've uninstalled and reinstalled and reset the tablet. This is a developer issue. PLEASE FIX!",
"If you guys could add a feature that you could save videos I would gladly change my rating. I also do not get that you can save photos but not videos. I like that this app is messaging for kids. Pls add a feature where you can do screen share and audio call thanks and pls add those features in the next update üòä, bye bye",
"This app is great! I use it daily to contact my friends and family. I do have one suggestion though,can you add a feature where you can post stuff like you would do on instagram or facebook and only the people you have added as contacts can see it? I think it woukd be a very cool feature!",
I used to love this app. But I've been trying to log in from my phone just to keep an eye on my 7 yr olds use but it suddenly keeps saying there was a problem logging me in and then the app closes. I even tried uninstalling and redownloaded from the playstore but it's continued to do it. Would not recommend but I'll update this rating if the problem gets fixed,
It works pretty well overall but the only problem is that when someone sends u a group of photos u can only save the first one. It doesnt allow to save the other ones in the group,
"This app is amazing! I love the stickers and gifs it provides. Most of my friends have it and I really like how it connects to regular messenger so I can text my parents, aunt's, cousins, and uncles. The only problem is that when the app has just gotten off of sleep mode, it does not let me send any messages and gives me a notification saying it will not send due to the app being in sleep mode even tho it let's me onto the app. other than that, It's perfect!",
"I'm only giving a 3 because some of the features on the parent end, aren't accessible. such as GIFs. my son can send them to me but not vice versa. His freezes up sometimes and doesn't alert him to a new message. Other than those issues, it's an alright app, definitely helps when I'm not around and I can text him.",
"I love this app! It is the best! I can't even describe it! You talk to as many people you want! There is cool filters, camera, and you can do something like FaceTime! You can change your picture for it and your favorite color! It totally makes kids feel like grown ups. You can text and FaceTime. I totally recommend getting this app cool!",
"This app is great!! I've been using it for many years now, and it has good protection over kids! Parents have the optional choice to see what there kid is saying, and see who is texting them! There is many fun filters, emojis, and much more on the app! You can have as many people as you want. The only thing is it does lag sometimes. You can be on a call and it hangs up for no reason. Besides that the app is great!",
Everything is good this app is great as long as you are using a compatible phone or device everything is fine. The only thing I want is so you can put backgrounds on your video if you are in the app in a call or just recording a video of yourself also instead of every week updating the filters how about updating them every day and out of most please make it so we can send links through messenger kids.,
I love it!!!! I call and text my friends on it all the time. The parent put their facebook info in (so the child does not use or have access to your facebook acount) and the child can personalize it from there. But before you can add more friends on the parent has to ok the friend. When your personalizing it the parent can choese who the child can be friends with and the app does the rest from there,
"I love this app. Theres plenty if games; filters and onto that I can message me friend. It may just be my phone, but whenever I'm in a call my screen flashes black on and off. Other times it will mute us all causing us to leave the call. Another thing- I wish you could send links. Sending links would be SO helpful since me and my friends are very big with gaming and yt so we want to share things we find. Overall great app and if you'd fix these bugs that would be AMAZING!!",
The *only* thing I don't like about this app is that the same options (filters & games) aren't available on the kids and regular messenger. This app though has been a lifesaver during lockdown. My daughter has been able to keep in touch with family and friends that she wouldn't have been able to otherwise. The games are a nice touch - it gives both parties a co-operative activity.,
"Okay, I like this app. It's a good app for the little kids. I have problem, however, with the notifications. I have turned on the desktop notifications and I am not getting any pop-ups. I have no way to turn the notifications on again and I've been missing all of my friends' messages. Please fix this.",
Love this app for the kide and I love that parents can see what the kids are sending and receiving. I also love that you pick who goes on their messenger. It might be my device because it's old but it lags a lot and we sometimes have problems with the video and speech freezing or lagging. My kids have fun with it and love it!,
The is the best application ever!!!!! And the other thing about it so can can text anytime but there is one thing about this app that is annoying. the thing is if I am on my tablet it just rings sometimes and it won't let me pick up the call until it has been ended but other than that it is awesome!!!! I highly recommend it,
"It's a REALLY great app! One issue though. . .ü•∫ On Christmas, my messages from November 27 - December 27 won't load. And I had pictures I wanted to save and videos I wanted to look back at, but they're gone... Not really happy about that... ü•∫ I've restarted my phone, hard closed out... Still won't worküò≠",
"I love this. All ny friends seem to have it. We have so much fun. The reason i couldn't give this 5 stars, is it seems that my friends have certain features that i dont have. We have the same devices yet they can do more. Whenever they all do the new feature i always go to the app store to update and i do. It is still the same and my friends have a new feature i dont have. Really a great app, but not for people who dont like being leftout.",
"Really great app and I am able to easily chat with my family and friends. The only problem is it takes up a lot of storage. On my phone, it takes up 19 gb!!! That is a lot. I barely have any storage and I can't get any other apps or take photos on my phone, but i need the app for communication. Otherwise, it is a nice app.",
"Pretty good, but there is no SETTINGS so I can't change my AVATAR because of the RESOLUTION",
"We have been using messenger kids for years, but something just changed on the 20th. I can no longer verify my kids accounts, I believe this has to do with an update. I was able to download an older version and I was able to sign right in. The problem, I can't download older versions on my child's device. Stuck with an endless loop of entering password to just be kicked back to the same page. Please fix this bug!",
"I downloaded this app for my daughter and I love how I can control who she can and cannot talk to. 3 stars because I always have problems with either the volume, there are times the video call is super low we cannot hear the other person. Then there are times where the video does not work. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get the video to work for chats. If it wasn't for my daughter loving this app so much I would already have gotten rid of it.",
This app is good.üëçMe and my friend has some problem but we are trying to work around it. Also the filters and games keep changing. The game's disappear in a day. You also should have a do not disturb setting so we can do stuff without being spammed.Over all this app is amazing the games are fun and I love contacting my friends. However the games and filters keep diapering. Can you bring those back. I feel like they are all gone. Please bring back the wolf game and the matching game. Thank you,
"I love that my son is able to communicate with family, send videos etc. And receiving notifications and a copy of the video chats that my son sent. It would be nice if the option to de delete a contact would be more accessible. I had to search through the parent dashboard and I found it minutes later.",
It's a very useful app. 1. It has a nice simple and easy to understand layout 2. There are literally 0 issues with the camera and calling system and messaging system 3. the interactive games are eye catching and enjoyable. Over all it's an amazing app.,
Missing key do not disturb feature. My daughter loves it with not being able to see her friends right now. We had to uninstall it because there is no way to turn it off. The iPad goes off every 10 seconds and at all hours of her friends calling. This is absolutely ridiculous not having an offline option.,
"Pretty useful for children, and that's good. But the reason I took two stars away is because messages don't send because they feel like it. Even when you, and the person you're texting has three bars. With new contacts, it says the messaged is sent but they don't see the message for some reason. This happens with groups too.",
"It works i guess but i can NEVER save images. If i want and image my freind or parent sent me i have to screenshot it which is frustrating because the other options/buttons have to be cropped out and my power button is broken so most of the time it just calls google assistant. Very crappy. Edit: ive been getting notifications like 5 minutes late which is very inconvenient when im having a conversation, sometimes i dont even get them, also its very slow/laggy when im using the app, another star.",
Tgis messager is so fun and good app for kids like me,
"this app is a great idea for kids to be able to communicate with their friends in a safe and supervised manner, but it keeps crashing and freezing. It crashed five times before we were able to get it work semi properly for one video chat. Very disappointing!",
"This app changed my life. I had to work with Google hangouts to text my friends, family, and more close people. And that was a huge struggle. It wasn't as ""perfection"" as Messenger Kids. My friend always talked about having it. So I got it! I love Messsnger Kids because it is so perfessional. It gives you a warm welcome and you start of with a fresh, clean start. It is so fun to do filters on video calls, draw on your photos, and play fun games. I wish you added a way to save videos. Thanks!",
"Perfect app. I can call my school mates and tell the among us codes and do meetings on the weekend and TONS more. As always I have a few suggestions. Itd be cool if there was a map, a bit like snapchat where you could see where your friends are and if it is possible to call them. 5 stars. Edit 1. Also it would be cool if you could choose ring tones from spotify or just from the app. Still 5 stars!",
"This app is absolutely amazing. I would say it's pretty awesome! You can call with whoever you have contact with and if anything suspicious happens then the parent can know! I love the app and how it's designed, I would recommend this app FOR SURE! üòÜüòÅ But the starting process can be long bc You have to go through the verification, Face book password your mail and the tutorial But it's worth it!! Thank you so much for making this app it's better for communication and absolutely amazing! AMAZING",
"Very awesome app. one thing is that you cant reply on the notification. You have to go to the app and quit what ever else you are doing. You should also add more games to play like UNO, connect four, chess, etc. Also i dont like that i cant choose a profile picture from your picture gallery. If you can pls fix these minor issues. Thank you for your time. - bts's biggest fan",
I guess the app can be iffy at times. I also wish you could make group chats without everyone having to add everyone. It gets a little annoying. I'd also like to see a normal calling feature not just facetime. Overall it's a pretty good app.,
"We love this app so much! My kids have had it for a while now, but since the stay home order, it has been God sent! They get to see their friends and family in a safe place! My 7 year old and his best friend even have it set up where they watch each other while playing games together. It is so nice to see them together again! I love that I have control over who they can talk to, how long, and I get notifications with any activity! Best kids app ever!",
"Two stars stop because if you do not add adult contacts during the setup process it is a serious pain in the neck to add them after. It only gives you the option to invite a parent or guardian to create an account for a child. Unless your child sends you a request for somebody who's on regular messenger, you can't just automatically go in and add them in the Add Friends section ... Really irritating. Otherwise the app seems pretty good.",
On my daughters tablet which is only a couple year old it stopped sharing audio after using for a year now. It works fine on my phone but that is obviously not convenient. I hope the issue can be resolved. The microphone works in other apps just fine.,
"It was a great app until a few weeks ago when several of my friends, (including me) messaging stopped working. The keyboard still appears, and the sould of the buttons still go but it wont show what we typed, it's weird. But when we type other things like on Google it works. I hope this gets fixed soon. *Writen by a 12 yo. In 7th grade",
"I LOVE THIS APP! It is just amazing! I can talk with my best friends even if they are in a different country! I dont always have to take my mom or dads phone to speak to my friends. Even though this app is amazing and made my dream come true, there is a bug where I call my friends and it keeps saying connecting and does not call them. Also I have a reccomendation, please add audio call because it is better. I cant facetime EVERY time I call my friends. So please make my dream even better.",
The most important feature (downloading your kids chat logs) doesn't even work. You make the request to get a copy and are given a link to download it. But when you click the link it always gives you an error with a Facebook message saying something went wrong we are trying to fix. Useless app.,
"It's a great app! I'm able to talk to my friends and family and it really helps me to connect with them. Although, there should be an option to delete messages or edit and it would be nice to have more filters on the video chat. Also this could just be me but lots of the time on video chat theres alot of feedback and glitches but that may just be internet problems I feel like parents feel more safe and comfortable with there child using this app. Very happy with this app.",
"it used to work great but now for some reason it doesn't send me notifications for any messages even though they are enabled. the help section is abysmal so I cannot figure out how to fix it. also it will not let me view images if someone sends them to me, my parents and family can send images but they show up saying that I can't view them. please fix this",
As a parent I don't like that you cannot delete conversations or videos. A tik tok video was sent with some bad language and I cannot delete it. Please contact me with info on how to do this if they have made the option available. I have not found it on any forums as of yet. Thank you. Also the app is not very phone friendly. I as a parent am having issues changing settings unless I get on the computer.,
"Great app over all with a few annoying tid bits. The protections are annoying to navigate through and trying to add family members for them to chat with can be inconsistent (some people aren't able to be added for some reason?) Apart from that, the protections are a necessity and I love the fact that the parent is in control of who gets approved to their list so they can't talk to just anyone. Also you can see who they speak to the most and if you're inclined, you can see their convos.",
"This app it okay but there is a few disappointments. First of all, I don't get any notifications and other reviews say the same. Second, I can't talk with a friends because she lives in a different country. That really disappoints me because I have to use this app for a few friends and another one for the rest. In other words this app isn't international. It would be nice if I only needed one app. Over all I would recommend it but you might need to install other texting apps wich is annoying.",
"I love that it's really safe and the parents have to okay all the friends but it is so hard finding the friends or the parents. The kids code helps only if the parents/kids know what I'm talking about. My kids sill can't upload their profile picture, that has never worked. All the games and ways they can interact with each other is awesome and so fun, especially now that kids can't really see & play with each other.",
"The app is only available if you log in with Facebook, and the parent dashboard is only available for Facebook users. Yet, nowhere does it say that the app is contingent on having a Facebook app. There is no other way to log in at all. Instead of working as an independent messenger that my child can truly contact friends and family through my phone number, it needs Facebook log in. In other words, let's just covertly ask for data and ignore those families that have chosen not to have Facebook!",
some of the updates have made it so when you're on a call you can't check your messages. so whenever im on a call with my friend i have to hang up to see something she sent me. Also maybe you could add a feature where when your on a call you can also go onto messages with another person. Thats my thoughts but over all its a great app,
"Good but bad. It is very nice and fun to do but...some times messages take over 6 hours just to reach the other location and some times it takes days. I can send something then look 2 days later to only see a blank check, and another annoying thing is when it randomly does not let your messages show up, I don't know why. Also some times it won't even let you type in a word, I'm sure this is not due to my wifi since I have strong wifi. So other than that this is fun and nice for kids.",
"My daughter (8) has a lot of fun using this app. She likes to communicate with her friends. As a parent, the management of contacts and access can be improved. I don't like that we cannot have separate passwords/logins for them. Instead, they need access to my account credentials which enables them to manage their own contacts (or not). Also, you need the app to manage contacts and cannot do it from the desktop site. No bueno! My daughter put a ""4"" for the rating but I am a ""2.""",
"To be honest, messenger kids is not a good messaging app. My issue with it is that half the time, I don't get notifications when I get sent stuff, which is a bummer. Then sometimes, a message won't even show up even if sent days before viewing until after I send a message in the conversation, and then I see the text. This is not a good app for messaging. Please fix this!üëé",
I love this app! My daughter loves to talk with her best friend on this app and ever since quarantine it's been a lifesaver. I definitely recommend because it's perfectly safe and kid friendly. You can also change your profile picture and you can do pretty much everything you can do on a normal messenger just for kids. Its child proof and you don't have to have an app to fully get your kids started. Its amazing and I love it!,
"I like this app; but my 2 kids don't have their own personal device, and they can only access the app on MY phone. I have tried multiple times to install the app on my Windows laptop; but it shows that it's installed on my phone, and won't give me the option of installing it on my laptop. All of the instructions I've found keep sending me in circles, and end with me spending a long time attempting to install to my laptop, with no results. Getting pretty discouraged about this because I have to use my phone for work.",
"I don't know whats going on with this app, but its a bunch of BS. It will not get pass the log on info. It ask for email address and password and once you hit authorize device it takes you back to the same screen over and over. I can't get no further than the password information. Normally when a app is having technical issues they will post an update online or something. So upsetting. I did a factory reset on my child iPad and deleted all of his favorite apps thinking the issue was his iPad!",
"Could be SO MUCH better. Tired of trying to ""fix"" the microphone issues between members. It is random and seems to come from different people at different times. It is exhausting trying to figure out who's mic isn't working and why because the solution is continually different. For a company that has had working Messenger system for nearly a decade, these ""glitches"" are something that shouldn't be happening.",
"It's good for messaging, but half the time there is no notification. Calls don't come through and messages only work from some people. Other people I know have said it happens to them aswell. All notification settings are on, aswell as sound and app settings.",
This app is amazing! You can facetime text and play there games. I do also love how you can log in by facebook so you remeber your password if you wanna get it on a device. My one problem is that the glitching. This app glitches when your in calls and texting. Its not my labtop its the App. So I hope you guys can fix that. Thank you for this wonderful App. Its a App everyone must try.,
"Such a great app. I call my friends all the time because of quarantine. The only problem I have is that there's only face time. I want to just call my friends. Other than that great app! Keep up the incredible work! Edit: So I also have another problem. So when I want to change my profile pic, I can only take a photo and can't got one from my gallery. Please fix this issue but so far INCREDIBLE JOB!!!!! You guys need to make a Facebook kids app! Hope you have an amazing day! üòäüòÅüòä",
"Its a good app but the reason why i give it 3 stars is because if i turn my camera off or if i like flip my camera, it just stops and goes black and theres no way to fix it other than ending the call. Please fix that. Also, i was wondring if you guys could put a dark mode so it isnt so hard on peoples eyes when they turn that on. Overall its a totally great app.",
i think its great when your out on vacation so you can text your family members.,
"Such a wonderful way for kids to interact with todays modern ways! I love that the parent/guardian, is in charge of the account so they can see and know who the child is in contact with! My daughters love it! Especially, my 10yr old, whom is a social butterfly!üòç Thanks Facebook for always staying with the times and improving all of the time! Keep up the great work!",
Its a really great app but it would be better if you all added the same filters that you have on regular messenger. I also have a friend who will call me and if i dont answer shell call me a 100 more times so i like if you had a limit to make it so she can only call me like 2 times or so and then she cant call me again for a while. You all also should make it so you can search any song and use it. And id also love it if you were to make it so i can use a pic from my photos. Thanks,
This is a good app but there is a few problems with it in my opinion 1. You can't turn your camera off you have to close out of the chat and you can't see the other person 2. There is kind of a glitch where if you want to type sometimes itll only type 1 letter and you have to press the button again That's it if they fixed those I would give it 5/5a,
It's so fun that I speak with my bff every day! But when I use a filter and tap the screen nothing happens,
"This app is great I got it so I could message my friends that do not have phone numbers and it works great! My only issues are 1 this app is targeted to younger kids and I think that the games easy. 2 I have an android cell phone and my brother has an I pad, for the I pad there are more filters and more text on the options, for example when it says on my phone ""take a funny phot"" it says on the I pad ""Take a funny photo!! New filters every week"" in short I love this app but see minorbugs",
"Although my notifications for this app are on, I NEVER get notified when my niece sends me a message. When I open up the app, there is never a message notification waiting for me. When I click on our conversation, there's a few messages from her. What I HATE about it, too, is that you cant even see when they sent you a message! For all I know it couldve been yesterday or 5 minutes ago! FIX THESE ISSUES.",
"I love the app but I wish there were more options for color and that you could save filters you want to keep cause after awhile they just dissappear,I also wish you could set the age different so that it is set up more like the adult messenger.i only say this because it is so frustrating to have to scroll through all those huge blocks that are people. If I could change any thing it would be to have an actual list if people for older kids .",
"Not bad, wish there was a way to ""sign out"" on one device and get no notifications on any during that time.. We have to use the same device for school classes and yes I set usage times but it's for bedtime and it would be much easier to sign out and then just sign in when done with school work so that way we're not getting phone calls the whole class and having to ignore them. He could just sign in after classes are over (which varies daily, therefore making the set usage times irrelevant)",
Needs easier access for parent controls. After the initial set up there is no way to go in and add/delete contacts until someone else sends a friend request. There needs to be a seperate log in for parent control on the app itself even if it's on the kids app or in parents messenger. You also can't change the child's name displayed after initial set up. This is a huge downside. Kids enjoy keeping up with family and friends through this and I love that I can see all passed conversations.,
"I downloaded it and created an account and added a person for chatting and when I went to retrieve messages sent by the person I added, I was prompted to download the app. This happened twice. I attempted to add an additional account for my other kid and it didn't let me set his account up with a photo. And no matter what I tried there, it would only let me use his account by switching to myself, the parent. Don't bother. Not user friendly. March 2021 update: this app still sux.",
"Kinda glitchy. I want the options to audio call, delete chats (like not just leave them) and to be able to make Screenshots my profile pic. This app isn't that good for older kids, since this app is very childish. I want more songs for the share a video with a song option. But otherwise this app is good.",
It's a good app my son loves it. I also like that I can put a time limit on it. The problem is the app keeps opening and giving me its asleep messages. When I'm in another app it will take over. I close it and it keeps popping up. Overnight when phones not in use it opens. I need a solution for this. I didn't do this for the first two weeks it just started a few days ago.,
"Messenger is a fun app for me and my friends to message with! A few concerns for Messenger to fix: 1 sometimes I get notifications which is frustrating! If my friends can't call I can't tell them why I'm not responding, 2 you can't turn your video of in the call! Lastly, you don't get a notification if you don't open the app. Messenger please fix this, thanks!",
This app is garbage. I've gone through all the steps several times and it will not let me finish the set up. My daughter has messages that we can't open. I uninstalled it hoping to just start over but if keeps going to the original account. Super disappointing.,
"I liked it. Chatting in Messenger Kids is similar, though I kinda wish you can add the share screen like in the original. The only big problem is though, that sometimes when I go into one of the group chats, it suddenly gets all slow even if the images sent aren't that detailed that much. If you can fix this, please do. Also, would appreciate if you can turn off the cam.",
"I like that my kids can keep in contact with their friends, and that I can control when they're able to use the app to talk to their friends. What I'd love to see added is a way that it warns the child when bedtime is about to start via a popup window, if they're using the app, so they know they have 5, 10 or 15 minutes left. I'd also like the ability to still message my kids after bed time kicks in - but only the parents have this ability.",
"I have never been able to use this app. I always get one of 2 error messages: ""Failed to Find Accounts"" or ""Account Creation Failure"". I've spent 2 months and countless hours trying to figure this out and there is no one to reach to fix. It's very disappointing that my daughter can't connect with her friends and classmates during the COVID19 lockdown. I wish I knew why this won't work. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",
"This app is good but,we don't get notifications when were not in the app and I just wish all devices would show the same thing because if I'm on a phone it won't show the same things as a tablet or if i was on a laptop and if I compare it to a phone It just won't show the same thing! It would be nice to be able to delete messages just in case you did something by accident. Lastly,it would be fun if you had three player games for when you are in a call with three people.Over all the app is great!",
It's a handy little app. But a major improvement to it would be for us to have the ability to set the kids profile pictures from our picture gallery as opposed to having to take a new picture each time. I mean I can understand a certain aspect behind requiring us to take a new photo each time.,
"I LOVE IT! It's great because now I text and call my friends without having to use my mom's phone. I'm giving this 4 stars because it could be better. Like a dark mode. Or maybe more colors. It would also be good if you can make your own code instead of it giving you a random one. But it would be good if you can play the games at the same time. Those are the ways I think kids messenger can improve.Also I wish you could add this setting where you can make you friends can see you as ""busy"".",
"Great way for me to communicate with mainly my son when he is at a friend's especially sleepovers. It can be discrete as well, if he prefers to keep it to himself at any point, for whatever reason. I made his little sister her own as well because she loves to video chat with him when he is not home. It's safe and easy to use. Two factors I was looking for in a messaging app for safety contact and communication. Glad I have it. Thanks for developing a useful tool in my current parenting arsenal.",
I think there should be a way for parents to delete messages that their child sent. I've also had difficulty finding people to add for my child on the app. A friends will add one of my children but when I try to search for that friend to add for the other child I can't fins them. Very frustrating.,
"Super frustrated. Just got my kids new tablets and it won't let me authorize them to use it. I put my password in, then it goes right back to authorize page. Have tried it in my phone and other devices, same situation. It's clearly the app. Why is nothing being done to fix this? I have read tons of reviews with same issue.",
"So this game was pretty good so I could talk to my friends, but sometimes when I am talking to my friends in individual chats it will randomly not let me send anything. And when I switch accounts sometimes it will stop working. And a big problem is I was switching accounts and it logged me out and even though I'm putting in the right email and password, it won't let me in. I'm very disappointed that I can't talk to my friends so please fix this. Edit: and some of the stickers are innapropriate",
I love this app!I use it to chat with my freind that I can no longer see in person because of COVID and I love it but there are a few issues. (Also plz make it to where you can nickname people individually) 1:Without good wifi the video quality is HORRIBLE but still you can still talk to the other person 2:android users cant select photo from gallery for there profile picture like apple users 3:updates take a while to actually kick in to the app even when updated (also glitch with new update),
"My kids have used this app on their Kindles with no problem. My daughter got a chromebook for Christmas and has tried using the app she downloaded from the Google Play store. It says it is compatible with her device. But when she opens it, it crashes every time. It appears we are not the only ones having this problem. Please fix this bug.",
"I want the app to be in a computer and is there any way to delete messages faster! And what about the links. I still can't send them. I am waiting for a better update to clear all these glitches. I have been using this app for a while now but I find it more annoying than the normal messenger app. Like DELETING PHOTOS, VIDEOS, MESSAGES AND VOICE RECORDINGS. Also I wanted a poll for this app that would be very pleasant. I find this app stupid and so annoying. I will not recommend this to anyone.üò°",
"This has to be the most amazing app that my daughter uses at 6 years old.‚ô•Ô∏èü•∞ Not only can she play games with her friends and make silly faces, take photos and videos, but when the quarantine happened she kept in touch with them as often as she wanted throughout every single day!!‚ô•Ô∏è It's easy to set up and add family too. I like that she can talk to only those I accept or add in her contacts. This is the best app that we have for her thank you so much!!?üôè‚ô•Ô∏è",
"Ii think this is a great app! I think you should add more games though,maybe like connect 4, or 'find the difference between the 2 pictures.' But when you want to change your profile pic, you should really make it so you can choose a photo from your gallery.",
"My child's account is linked to one of my other profiles and there's nothing within your app's ""parenting controls"" or at all that allows me to fix it. I've contacted supported and yet to be advised on how to correct the situation. Plus it doesn't allow calls, i dk it's GARBAGE !!!!",
"Good, but it says for my friends that there is a ""Set your emoji"" thing. I thought I just needed to update the app, but even after getting the latest version it didn't appear, and my friend said it was right above decorate your app, she even sent me a screenshot saying so. Then, I thought it was only for iOS. If that's the case, please make it available for Android, if not, please fix this. This is the same for setting your profile to something already in your gallery!",
"Having major issues with this app. It was working fine and now suddenly when my daughter uses video chat it freezes and the person on the other end can't hear her. I've uninstalled, reinstall and restarted the device. Nothing has solved the problem. Please help fix this as my daughter relies on it a lot",
"Some of the 2 player games have started glitching. It won't let me and my friend play the games anymore. The games that are gliching are: Art team ,Ice fishing and Dice trap. If you haven't already can you check them out and fix them? Thanks. By the way great app!",
"Every time I call it turns black and I freeze sometimes and also when I do the video with the music I press send but it just turns into a orang screen also when I try to make a group it just freezes so can you plz fix that please and thank you. And it logged me out and it logged me out and it's not letting me in it says ""session expired."" So PLZZZZZZZZZZZ fix that????ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫",
"I love this app! There are 2 things that I would add in the app 1st, like make your own story, it's like insta and snapchat like if you want to post something but you can't then you can click on the profile and there is gonna be a button change story so the 2nd thing I think I would add is make your own sticker there always stickers that I want to add but I can't because they don't have it maybe when you go to a person and click on sticker and there's gonna be make stickers button and done bye!",
"I can not deal with this system, I had my telephone number be recognized as being associated with an account, but the password was not recognized. I haven't used Facebook in any form for years, and I have never changed the password. I tried to get authorization but the texts and emails I have requested are not getting any response.... I can't login with my account, nor can I sign in with a freshly made account because the automated system is not send out codes via text or email.",
"This app continues to crash. It hasn't even opened without crashing for 2 weeks. We have uninstalled, shut down, clean the computer.... NOTHING works. Sent an email with our concerns ... NOTHING.. Don't ask for feedback if you wont fix it or even respond with reasons why. My daughter was using this to talk to her grandmother acrossed the Country. Now she is used to talking but cant. That totally sucks!",
It's pretty good I just wish it was a little more easy for the kids. And I wish there was more songs that they could choose from because I tried to type in baby shark it didn't show up and then you guys had a whole list and there it was listed as baby shark. This is my first review I'll come back after we use the app a little bit but I really like the safety protocol for the parents,
"like the app because it allows me to reach out to my boyfriend when we can't see each other, plus this is his only way of communtication with others. But I hate all the gliching. I go to text and it takes forever to send, I go to call and it beeps and says connecting for at least 2 min, or it will say ""messenger kids is not responding"". When I'm trying to commicate with my friends or bf it is irritating when it won't let me text or call them. If you fix it I and many others will rate it 5 stars",
This app is great for communicating with friends and family. But I almost never get notifications when I recieve a message. Sometimes I will miss something important. I have to constantly check it to see if I got a message. I know its supose to be for kids but the gifs are a bit too kidish. Like some regular ones would be fun. Its a simple parent set up or you can be your own parent. You can be friends with anyone whos parent is friends with yours.,
Please fix the bug on your app!!! As someone else has mentioned. I CANNOT get into messenger kids. It keeps sending me on a CONSTANT LOOP of trying to authorize my login details only to automatically log out straight away and back to login details again and again and again and again!! It is definitely an issue with your app as it is happening on several devices!! Please fix this immediately,
"Has a great parental control feature that let's you log out of devices its running on. Very handy if your kid puts down their device and doesn't log out. DON'T USE THIS FEATURE. When you try to log in again you will get ""unable to log in your child"" notification after trying to authorize device with you FB password. Cleared data, cache Anderson reinstalled. Doesn't solve problem. Locked out on all devices. Lots of people online with same issue...and of course no update or support from Facebook.",
"Its wonderful I love using it to video call my grandma and playing with my friend. And there are no ads and its also cool that you turn emoticons into emojis when the message is sent. But, it'd be nice if you got notified anytime you got a message. I mean, in regular messanger you do. I know you get notifed on a message when youre in the app, but it'd be nice if you were notified in a different app.",
"9/26/21 @*UPDATED review I love this app! The games are mostly easy to use & understand. Sometimes there are glitches in some of the games though like the two game 2 players. And some are hard to figure 2, at least for me. But overall it's a great way to stay connected to younger children. And easy-to-use while teaching them phone etiquette. I highly recommend this approach for l I ts of communication between family I have had a blast with my grandblessings! They are small but learning quickly.",
I have had it for years I love it!!!!,
"I would say best app ever but, I just hate the constant notification of ""your in bedtime mode."" I also don't like that if you get a call during bedtime mode, it still rings. I feel bad because I can't answer and it is annoying. But besides what I just said, great app. I reccomend it ro everyone! ( Except for adults )",
"I love this app! It is really fun but there is some problems. First, there's something kinda creepy. When you go to take care of your pet. I took him to the shower. I looked in the shower curtain and saw a reflection of my face in the shower curtain. Creepy. I also don't like how the voice message doesn't let you cancel it, it sends it automatically. It also doesn't let you save the voice messages.Those are some problems I don't like and I hope you could fix it please. Otherwise it is GREAT!",
App has been good for my daughter. Biggest issue is the sleep mode. She can still respond to the text feature in sleep mode. Plus it still notified her that someone was sending something which makes it hard to get her to go to bed. They should consider updating the app to not make any noise or messages during sleep mode.,
It's really fun and you can text all your friends and interact with them; and there is some really funny filters. I recommend getting this app for your kids. ( Especially if they wanna text there friends üòâ),
"good for chatting with friends and works well before they have a phone number or phone. 4 stars because the videos never load, and it's pretty annoying. by the way, to everyone saying they're messages aren't delivering unless their kid gets on the app, it is always delivered the moment you press send. you either are confusing the little checkmark for not being green but that just means you sent it, or, you just have terrible wifi which isn't the creator's problem.",
"I love this app for me! The only problem I have is that my filters stop working sometimes, but I don't really care, and sometimes my mic doesn't work, so my friends can't hear me, but overall everything is good!",
"Okay, this app is pretty much awful. My notifications when someone texts me almost NEVER show up. The video calls are just plain broken, I can constantly hear my self echoing in the call. Honestly, in my opinion, this app should really step up their game because I'm sick and tired of having to mess with settings all the time. And no, my notifications aren't off for people. Hope I could help anyone who read this, buh bye!",
"I would like this app more if it didn't control who I can add to my child's account. For some reason it only give you the option to add a handful of adults.. none are the ones I would like to add. Also, when I search for my sister (my child's aunt) she doesn't show up.. it says we have to be friends on facebook.. but WE ARE. Seriously considering using a different app because of this.",
"Yeah... Can't even get in to try it. Keeps saying no network connection, which I obviously do have a connection or I wouldn't have been able to download it. I closed app and restarted multiple times, reinstalled, cleared data, restarted my phone, checked for updates- nothing has fixed it. Bummed out cuz it sounded like a cool idea",
My daughter loves it. When no one is available for her to speak to me she plays with the little pet that they make available was kind of like a Giga Pet and she sends coloring pictures to her friends pick a color pictures together that's her age I like. But she sends me way too many messages she drives me nuts but other than that it's cool it would be better if other family members that don't have the app will be able to send her messages only half of my friends can receive her messages,
The Messenger Kids app has simplified my life so much. My son can video his family and friends whenever he wants now on his own phone. (My old phone just connected to wifi.) The best part is he can only communicate with the people I approve! It also allows me to peek in on all conversations if I need to. It's safe and simple for my 5yo and makes him so happy to reach family and friends we don't see very often. Love this app and highly recommend it!!,
"Great app to keep children connected in a safe way with peers, friends and family members during this isolation situation. My son enjoys it very much, we would like more animations during call but overall a good application. I don't know if it allows for group calls I think no but that could be another great improvement.",
Recently there was a glitch where my mom sent pictures of some books and it wouldn't let me view them and it kept glitching for the rest of the day I couldn't even open the app without it shutting down I think it's fixed now but that was the only problem that I had with it and maybe make it where not so many people can sent friend requests to you.,
I love this app!!! I have so much fun with my grandbabies with the silly stickers and faces especially with this coronavirus they can easily get ahold of me and it's so much easier than for them to dial a #. I definitely recommend this app it's safe which in today's world is very important.And it's easy to set up. Their are some restrictions but it's for the kids safety which is understandable.,
"Good app, I can talk with friends and parents, and play games etc. Issue 1: It keeps unmuting and muting every SECOND in a call. Issue 2: When I'm in a call the other person's camera or mine is all black. Issue 3: The games or filters don't activate when I tap on them. Issue 4: The call ends by itself. Issue 5: When Sombody calls me I press accept but it declines. Or when I call sombody they press accept and it declines. PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!!",
Hi perfect text for kids because theres games and things I LOVE THIS APPp and filters on the calls and photos or videos Theres just two thingsthat needs to be fixed When u text it doesn't send in time and that makes me mad üò° because what if I am texting my friend and she says the answer to my question . And the filters hang me up but I don't care about filters at least I get to talk with friends. Great app!!!!,
It will only let me text certain people and that one person it won't let me text will not get any of my messages and it's is very important,
"Great app but you can't make the kid's profile picture an existing picture. You have to take a picture at the moment you are changing it. Also, notifications never come up unless you have been active very recently which can be an issue. Other than that, very secure and I love the code feature.",
Same issue as recent post(s). Attempts to verify connection to parent account send app into neverending login loop. First experienced issue a couple days ago and waited to try again thinking it would be resolved quickly and it wasn't. Too bad as it was a great app for keeping my kids in contact with relatives and now they can't.,
"Very, very, very skeptical at first since I don't give my child access to the internet yet. But this app does it right and I feel safe walking away and letting her call and text whoever she wants. The control the app gives you is perfect and everything that you need is easy to find.",
"I used to have this app to message my cousin before my phone was factory reset. I downloaded it again recently and it won't let my dad log in because it says there is a connection error, even though I'm connected to wifi with full bars. I deleted and redownloaded and it did the same thing, it's really frustrating because this is the only way I can talk with most of my family members and now it will not even let me use my account anymore.",
"It's a cool app for kids to connect. Would be great if parents had the option to delete messages. Because we can't delete messages, it takes up all the storage on my child's device. Making her tablet almost useless. Pushing storage to SD card would be a helpful option as well. Fix it please!",
"Love the ability to have the kids talk to their friends and family members in a safe, controlled environment. They love chatting and playing the fun games with friends and family. Only extra thing that would make it even more amazing, would be the ability to control the contacts list from my Messenger account as well as the Facebook page. Rather then only being able to check it through my Facebook page. Otherwise fantastic app, very grateful for it:)",
"Technically this is a 5 STAR . But I've had problems for weeks now so its a 3 star. Problem is where it won't login to the account and just says its asleep and to check with parents well I have and its not set up that way. So as of now we don't use it but before when we could it was great! My son loves the backgrounds, games (I don't like), the face changers and stickers.",
"I don't have much to say, but I have one question. On the new update, I can't select my favorite color (color theme). It automatically changed to dark blue. Idk if it's a glitch or what but I have no option to have a favorite color. It may also be the device I'm on that doesn't supply this option, which would be stupid. I'm currently on Samsung Phone, idk the date of release, but I do know my phone isn't even 2 years old. Please fix.",
"AUDIBLE NOTIFICATIONS IN SLEEP MODE You set sleep mode hours so your child isn't messaging at night or being awakened by the app, but it still goes off OUT LOUD, with a preview of the message they're missing out on. Then it pops the ""Your app went to sleep"" screen - on every device it's installed on, in front of whatever you - the parent - are doing. Unbelievable. Unacceptable. JUST FIX IT. Plus: it would make sense for the sender to get a bounce-back message saying their friend is asleep. NOPE",
It's such a amazing app where kids get to FaceTime take cool photos with your (friend/friends but there's two things sometimes I want to do voice call cause I don't like to show my face when I'm talking to my friend.and there's this other thing when I send a photo or video on accident when I just wanna hear how my voice sounds with the filter you can't delete it,
It was terrible. I would give it 0 stars if I could. It wouldnt even let me create an account for my daughter. I have a facebook account; it recognized me. And then error. I re set everything. Re installed the app and everthing. Tried on a 2nd device still an error. And there is not trouble shooting spot to click! Frustrating! BOOüëé,
"Overall it's ok but it does alot of glitches, especially during calls like, sometimes me or my friends cameras goes black and we can't see each other, also there is the glitch where it logs me out, sometimes it takes my friend 3min to get into the actual app. So in conclusion there are alot of things that need to be fixed.",
"Me and my friend keep getting kicked out of the call for no reason. Can you fix this issue, I don't know what's causing all of it. It happened again right now when my friend is calling. We can't have a nice time playing games together without being kicked out. Please fix this issue. Although it is a really good way of contacting your friends from far distances!",
I LOVE THIS APP! I get to talk with my friends outside of school and we can also call! This is such a good app because you can add your friends by adding in a code! The one thing I don't like is the bedtime (Or whatever it's called). I am sometimes in the middle of conversations and it just turns off! Maybe you could add something where you could ask for 5 more minutes and it would send a notification to the parent to allow it! I would love it if that was added in!,
"Overall decent experiance. However it gives ZERO NOTIFICTIONS 75% of the time!!! It generally will notify by call only. It has gotten worse in the past 3 years. I used to love the app. I cannot sent GIFS to kids messenger, however, my son can send them to my regular messenger. It would be great if the date and time was available on each message. Also if classic games like chess, checkers, and snakes and ladders etc were available to play with contacts.",
My child had an account and it was deactivated a few weeks ago. No idea why an dno idea how to reactivate. There's no way to contact anyone about it and I keep trying to create another one with no success. Can someone from Facebook fix this? My child cannot keep in contact with school friends they cannot see because of covid. I have sent multiple messages with no response.,
I know this is long but please read. This is a great app but I just wished it would of been a little bit more advanced. It worked ok and loved it but I just wish it had more things to do. I like how you can call other people and that I can take pictures with filters. I also like how I can play games with my friends and send voice messages. But it had a hard time sending my messages through even when I had good internet connection but I could still receive texts from other people,
The app is good that we can set up account for kids to send message. But i put it on my kids ipads and it wont work on landscape mode. They always have their ipad on landscape mode so it not usable in portrait mode. Please update it so it can rotate to landscape mode.,
I love this app so much and it is perfect for my kids. And get this you have a lot of controls on this app so your kids are safe. If there's a contact that you don't know about then you can delete from their contact list on messenger kids. There are such fun features. But the only thing I kind of wish is that you have the ability to do both video call and regular call but you can only do video call.But if you have an older phone that can't do video chat.,
"Okay not too bad, but not that great either. Sometimes I want to send videos to my sister with ""Share a Song"" and it never lets me!!! Also, when I call my cousin with stable connection this black screen blinks on and off. Its annoying. Please fix this and I will change my review.",
"the app doesn't let you log in, some people do but have some problems with the next step. howver i can't login, it always says error then try again later. i reinstalled the app a lot of times and even restarted my phone just in case, yet nothing works. it always says to try again later, i figured out that a lot of people were also having the same problems as me, please fix this.",
"MY PHONE IS ALIVE I KID YOU NOT!! EVEN ON ""DO NOT DISTURB"" IT STILL MAKES NOISES WHEN I SEND A TEXT TO A FRIEND! IS THIS TO MAKE THE PARENTS AWARE OF ME TEXING?!!? IM BEING STALKED!! but really, easy to use, wish there were more colors and dark mode. I also want to say, I have had this app for about a year and it doesn't notify me when I get a text message anymore, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone, turned the notifications on and off but I still have no luck.. please fix this",
"Downloaded this on my childs ipad and overall it works good, she can send pictures, and messages, but when she goes to video chat, cant see herself, only the other person shes chatting with, not sure how to fix this issue. Thats why i give it 2 stars for the time being, i would love for her to see herself especially because she wants to see herself with filters and to play games.",
Kids messenger is a well made app with lots of little fun things to do on it the video is perfect but I have some issues one of them is that there is no camera off button so you cant turn a camera off and the second thing is sometimes it will glitch and your screen will be black and third your thing disconnects unknownly but other then that this app if perfect.,
Very sad that the app just stopped working. I reported the problem several times and just no response. I tried with different android devices and it keeps asking me to enter my password and then sending me to the login screen again. I tried on an IPhone device and it worked but too bad because I do not own an IPhone. Is this a bug on Android devices only???This was a great app while it worked but no response to the problem is even worse.,
I love this app. I can message and face time all of my friends that have the app. I can also send pictures and videos. My only criticism is that I can't send gifs anymore even though my friend can. My mom didn't put any restrictions and I used to be able to. We didn't change anything so it makes no sense why I can no longer send gifs.,
"I loved this app. But now the face filters don't work they just say ""find a face"" even though I'm staring into the camera. My calls and messages don't pop up in my notifications even though I have it to where it's supposed to. And when I try to put a profile picture on its turns sideways. My phone is up to date. Help!",
"This is a great app as my kids can message the people I've set up as their contacts, however I couldn't find everyone I wanted. Thought I could add them later. Tried that and it says I can only add people (adult) to her contact list who I'm a friend with... I AM friends with child's grandmother, and cannot find her anywhere through the apps links to add a new contact!! How do I do this? Please help!",
"This app is pretty good. While you don't need to get your child a sim card for this, you also don't need to have a phone number. You can add friends with a friends code and parent permission. There are also in-app games that teach your child safety AND respect. Your child can also video chat with friends! No ads. The only downside is that it is quite glitchy sometimes and it is extremely hard to add friends.",
"I like the app and all, but I wish video chat was full screen like regular video chats are. Also, instead of you having to take a picture as your profile, I wish you could just like put any photo in your gallery instead of having to take a picture of yourself or something. If you guys just edit these things, it would probably be the best messaging app for kids, and for me.",
"the notifications don't work very well. When I get a text, the notification is only there for about 30 seconds before it disappears. So if I am not on my phone when I get a text, I can't see the notification. Now, this is not always the case. Sometimes I still have the notification hours later, and I get notifications when I miss a call. Also, the new features that come with updates don't always appear on my app. Take the nicknames for example, my friend has it, but I don't. Please fix your app.",
"i mean, its good, but im having a problem texting. i have to tap the bar (normal) but after i type one letter, it stops typing then i have to type the bar again. also, unlike how it used to be, you have to tap the bar again after sending a message. before you could just start typing again. please fix this, its really irritating me.",
"It is great for connecting my kids to family and friends. My only complaint is that whenever their friends call them my phone will ring but no notifications will pop up. Even when I go into the app, it doesn't say that anyone is calling. My phone just rings and vibrates. I uninstalled it and am reinstalling to see if that fixes it.",
"the app is good quality nut has a tendency to lag with all the funny filters and me and my friend were playing a zombie game where you have to put bricks in front of the door before the zombies get you but they move to fast and always catch us and as ive stated before, it lags often. now that could be a me problem but it happens with other peope to. over all it is a nice app to chat with your friends but i feel like its missing a few things. like 3-player games or something.",
"Okay...... so the app that I know of has these BIG Square like shapes that show your contacts . And I love that about the app! If you got that one keep it and DON'T upgrade it! Now some things that I do not like about it, one, you can change your color but only one contact at a time is only for your messages. And NOT the hole app itself. Two, you can customize your photo, and name ( and sometimes your emojiüòê) but in the new app they do not have a emoji, and you can not see other peoples pic.",
"This app is really good and helpfull! Kids can now safely text and call others with a parents permision. There are a few fetures that you should add. One being that if you send a video, people getting the video can't save it to their gallery. Being able to search up people. It can be very annoying having to scroll up and down to find the right person. Chose a contact name, so far you can only change a group name, and for saftey the parent should see the real name aswell as the contact name.",
"Why does everything ""kids"" automatically= bloat it up with a bunch of games? I was happy for an app for my kids to chat with their grandparents, but instead the games become a huge distraction. And now, when my daughter tries to open a contact, it will randomly open a video call with the contact instead. I've tested it myself, and it is random, with every contact, no matter where that contact is clicked. Disruptive for the person on the other end at the very least, and not good for all ages.",
"This app is great for my daughter. (This is my daughter's review.) It's definitely good during this time of Covid19 because you can't really connect with others very well. It's also good for me because my friend has just moved from about a block away, to right out of town. So I can connect with her through messenger kids, (and school.) One of the only things I don't like is that you can't take pics from gallery. That's really all I want updated. So if you could update this I'd be SO SO SO HAPPY!",
"Parental controls don't work as well as advertised. Sleep mode does not turn the app off if any conversations are currently open, notifications still pop up even when turned they're supposedly turned off, and hours are not as customizable as they should be.",
"As a child user of this app I think it's fine at best for younger children. You probably know on most apps if you make something there is a share button and it shows a bunch of options on where to share it to and all your texting apps pop up, well messenger kids doesn't show up so you might think ""Oh you can just press other and send the link"". You can't send links videos or anything else on a different platform. If you have a trustworthy child who is even a bit tech savvy and 10 and up dont use",
"Suddenly won't let me in. Used for a couple of years now, but suddenly it keeps asking for authorization, so I put in password, it then says logging out, that it requires authorisation. Loop that as many times until it says you've tried too many times. I've tried the one off code option. Changing passwords. Nothing works.",
"It would be 5 stars if it would give me more filters on the phone I have. Another promlem I have is I can't here my cousins calls when she/he calls or texts me. (you don't need to know their gender). But, for the most part its a good app. The call and picture quality is good some lag but not very often. I get to talk to all the people I love and know like my friends and family. Other than that one thing is the only issue I have with it. I love the app otherwise. (completly kid freindly)",
"Pretty good app for young children to stay in contact with the family that doesn't live nearby or for the family they don't see that often! I also REALLY like the fact that I am able to monitor and control everything my child does just from MY device, while still giving her that feeling of responsibility and ""being a big girl"" because she is able to choose who to talk to when she wants too, from her own tablet...",
I'm having the same problem as everyone else and I just added someone before this happened. I used to love this app but now I don't like it because Facebook isn't answering anybody's messages. I even uninstalled and installed it over and over again so please fix it thank you. Is this ever going to endüò°!!!!! Update: I will never use Facebook until they fix it so fix it or else! PS: tell me when you fix it please. Like a notification or something to notify everyone else too.,
I like the app but i find it a bit challenging to add friends for my kids. I also dont like that it doesnt create my own profile..its super confusing to have access to everything as being your child...there definitely has to be some big improvements made,
"This is a fantastic app for staying in touch and generally socialising. But I was showing the filters to my brother and he wanted to see one he had seen before, but it wasn't there. I just ask that you keep old filters or tell me if I click a button to get to them or something. But overall amazing app.",
"When ever I try to make an account it says there was an error try again! I have re downloaded the app restarted my phone and even tried on a different device and different email accounts. I don't understand what's wrong, if it works ill change the review but for now it's really starting to frustrate me.",
Love the app super protective and very useful. My child can make groups with her friends and she can message her family. The only problem that's kind of annoying is you can't call call you can only video call. But other word I love the app and it has tons of filters. I'm very pleased.,
I can't get in. Kids are sending messages to me that I cannot open. Soooo frustrating. I've tried numerous times and am always led ultimately to the screen that tells me to download to android. When I hit that. I go right back to the page that asks me if I want to uninstall or open.,
"It is slow to get on some thkngs and it takes me about 30 seconds just to message oe of my friends. Other than that, its pretty good. Highly recommend it if you are looking for a kid-friendly place for your kids to talk to relatives and friends!! I have never had any ads or bad things happen here.",
"Problems: It doesn't give me notifications when people text me, even though I have enabled them. It won't let me send texts randomly, and then sends me a notification. ""Messenger Kids isn't working because..."" When I click on it it just takes me to the app without any explanation. It won't let me play games with my parents or other adults. Good things: You can take funny photos and it's free. I hate this app!",
"Great app for kids to communicate with their friends. I can limit who my child can contact and who can contact her. I feel very safe allowing her to use the app. Only dislike i have is i have it installed on my phone and some of her friends will blow up my phone, even after being told to stop and i cannot stop it without uninstalling the app or turning off my phone. It would be great if i could mark her account as unavailable when i don't want her friends reaching out.",
"Just added, but it needs a lot of improvement. I don't like that when you first set it up you can choose a picture from your files, but once logged into the account you can't change the photo except by taking a live picture. Maybe kids want to pick a picture from their SD card? That's whack that you can't change that and go into your files. Also, would like to preemptively block people I already have on my restricted profile to protect my child. Please fix these issues.",
It is a good app but it would be really nice if you could save videos it is a great way to stay in contact with friends. I just wish you could call them without FaceTiming them it does have lots of games that you could play and you can make groups but sometimes the messages won't send overall it's a good app I recommend downloading it üíô,
"So frustrating!!! Walked through all the steps, sent out all the requests. Downloaded the app, got to the part I needed to authorize the device....... Invalid password!!!!!! Every time. I changed my FB password 3 times to hopefully rectify the problem but to no avail!! I hit the send me a temp password 6 times and nothing no email no text!!! Did the same process on a secondary device just incase & the same on both! Now there are messages for my dtr and no access to them!!!",
"Love the app! I love using it to talk to my friends especially since I've no other way to. Two things tho. One, my friend sent my this thing that said if I sent it to ten people, I would get new colors. I didn't. Two, our chats weren't supposed to be deleted, and now they are. It's kind of sad, as I enjoyed looking back sometimes. Plz fix if you can! Rest of it is amazing!",
"I really like this app you can video call with friends and family. My only problem with this app is you can't send links, but I get it for safety reasons. And you don't get to pick your ring tone so that sucks. But other than that it's a great app and if your not comfortable with your kids texting without you seeing what there texting, you could use this app with out looking at there phone/iPad.",
"It would be great if you could add more than 2 adults for parental controls. Even if it's just the parent who created the account who controls that portion. Sleep mode is awesome. The notifications are very spotty. Sometimes the kids will get the notice, most of the time not so much- Even if they are in the middle of a conversation.",
"App stopped working, kept saying unreachable for incoming/outgoing calls. Tried updating, still couldn't make calls. Tried logging out, restarting tablet, then logging back in, still no calls. I uninstalled app, then reinstalled only to now have it say at login that my FB account is unauthorized for the app. Device: Alcatel Tablet 9024w Android: 7.1.1",
This is a great app! I can chat with my friends and it is safe it blocks out swears and best of all you can play games On a texting app! this app makes me happy you can make groups you can hear your friends voices there is 1 problem though sometimes the call disconnects out of no where! But over all its an amazing app! üß∏üíï,
Same issue here with the parent conformation login. Was working fine for the last year. Really surprised that FB is not doing anything as this is quite frustrating for their would-be future customers. As a programmer I always have a fall-back solution. Very disappointed.,
"The functionality is perfect. The filters are weird. I know this is for a wide age-range, but some of the face filters creep me out as an adult üòÇ. I like that they switch it up, but hope future changes just remain silly, not grotesque.",
"So recently I have been having problems where suddenly when I'm on call, It freezes and the the sound turns off and can't hear them. It makes it really hard to use this app 'cause I use it all the time to talk with my friends. I don't know if it is my chromebook or messenger. I'll look into it. Thank you.",
"Such a cringy app with the laziest of features. Can't even select a profile picture from my gallery and you can't even see a text when you send it at first so you end up writing two of the same message! The tracking on the ridiculous looking images is mediocre at the least, and overall just a useless app when you can use the app that comes with your phone when you get it that is far superior and much easier to use. I get what you were going for, but this is so unnecessary.",
"This app is great! Though, when I try to do lip sync on the song maker, it b slows down my lips so then when it says something and I say it in inusine, for example, ""because I'm happy,"" I say that two like four seconds after and it screws up everything.",
"As a user, I find it EXTREMELY annoying that I have to talk to my parents in order to start a chat with someone new. If someone does get your friend request code, you probably know them in real life. Now, I don't mind that at the very beginning, you have to sign in with your parent's facebook, but it can be annoying. Other than that, it's a good platform. Since I can't send pictures through texts (due to parental ""guidance""), I do enjoy sending funny pictures to my parents and friends.",
"This is a good app! It works really well, and I use it a lot. I don't know if this is for all Android users or not, but for some reason I don't have badges or any minigames. I tried to update the app but it didn't do anything. But that aside, this app is great! Edit: You can't delete contacts once you have them, I really wish you could. Also, why can't I see my group? I've created one but can only get into it through notifications. This needs to be fixed.",
"I use this app to message multiple friends. I've been using it for years. But there's always so much issues and lags! All of a sudden,we wouldn't be able to click on and hear each other's messages. Furthermore,we wouldn't even be able to see the pictures we send to each other. This is an ongoing and recent problem I've had. It's extremely upsetting for us.",
This is one of the best apps I have ever used! I love it and it is TOTALLY kid safe. You can message all of your friends and facetime. But whenever I facetime I cant turn around my screen. It is extremely annoying but other than that great work!üòäüòäüòä,
"It keeps giving me the same error message (""Account Creation Failure""), but there's absolutely NO context as to why it failed. And when I've tried to find out how to message some kind of customer support, of course there isn't anything available. I'm an adult who's 24 (almost 25), and my Facebook reflects that, yet I can't make an account for my daughter with Messenger Kids. Others have had the issue but I'm not finding any results via Google.",
"Has logged me out of all devices and won't let me or my child log back in. We've uninstalled the app, restarted out phones, done system updates and still will not log in. Loads and then goes straight back to the log in page no matter what we try. I've emailed seeking support with this and so far no response. Had no issues with the app until now, would appreciate the help to fix it.",
currently I'm having issues giving the app access to my kids microphone and pics on the Ipad. I've tried it on my Ipad and it works fine. But when I try on his it will not give me the option at all. Even when you go into the settings section there isnt an option to turn on acces to anything but Siri and running in the background. We have this app running perfectly on my other childs Ipad but for some reason it will not work on the 2nd childs Ipad.,
"Awesome way to keep in touch with a child if they really aren't old enough for a real phone yet, as long as the device you use is connected to WiFi or internet. My daughter has a phone now but we still use this app to talk and FaceTime, it has the best picture and barely ever buffers, plus the filters are super cute when video chatting!",
"Won't let me set up an account for my child. Says ""Account Creation Failure"" every single time. A thorough web search of this issue shows that many people have encountered this issue but have not received a reply from Facebook when they reported the problem. Maybe a one star review will elicit a response? I'd like to use this app but until they offer a solution i guess i'll just uninstall it. Too bad...seems like it would be a useful application.",
"This app is great. But I am giving it three stars for some reasons. One: I can't give my profile picture from my gallery, I have to take picture when I want to change. Two: It needs a dark mode so that it looks cool. And last: Some new emojis and stickers. Thats enough and other wise its excellent.",
"I love the many ways it offers to keep him safe while using the app. I was skeptical at first but when covid caused the lock down last year and he could not see his grandparents, we decided to let him try using it even though he was only 4 years old. It is so easy to use he never has an issue and he loves the special effects.",
"I used to really like the app, but now when I use headphones everyone around me hears the call, I don't know why it's doing that but if you could please fix the glitch (If it is a glitch) Also, when I'm on call and I close the app it turns my screen black so if you could fix that too. And I also don't get notifications from the app when my phone is off, and I was reading other people's reviews and they had this same problem so please fix it. But other than that everything else is fine! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Stars",
"Same thing here. Endless loop. When I try to log in with my FB password, I click Authorize Device, only for it to come right back to the login screen. This is a very basic function. I cannot comprehend how this has been happening for more than hour, but weeks???? Did FB stop supporting the app or something?",
"I really like this app, but I wish that there was more filters. Some times the app just keeps redoing the same filter over and over again and it gets a little annoying sometimes. But overall it's a great app I recomend you download it. üëçüòÄ",
"Really I would rate this app a 2.5, I do like the app for calling friends. The problems though I kinda have a lot like when my phone blacks out in a call. I got in trouble for sending an ""inappropriate message"" but really it was a guy in red armor. Sometimes messages won't be able to send. Sometimes there will be a delay between messages (my longest message delay from someone was when I had to wait 13 hours for it to send). Overall I think messager kids can be very picky.",
"Great App! Great security and fun features. I would recommend this to 5 and up! I just think you guys should add screen recording, and possibility is people can abuse it like show inappropriate stuff, but there should be a üö´ thing in the corner of the recording. Then if the other kid sees something they could report it too the parent and block it from view. But I only gave 4 stars because you can bypass the chat and video and image filter.",
I sometimes have a few bugs but I still can use this app good. I have a regular phone now but some of my friends don't so this is a great way to talk without texting regularly. And unlike some people say there actually is a way to mute or block someone. It is totally kid friendly. The only thing is that it would be nice if you could talk while playing a game. But that's it.,
"Won't let me get past the authorization with my Facebook login, just takes me straight back to the login screen and can't get past it. So frustrating! I've tried removing app and re installing but still the same issue. Please fix this, seems like a lot of people are having the same issue",
"I enjoy this app very much. I haven't had many problems except for when it's running slow, but it's probably my device. It's an amazing app. But one thing I would request is that you move the spot of the thumbs-up button. Sometimes me and my friends accidentally press it when we don't mean to. That is all, keep up the great work!",
It is a great app. But I have a problem. The kids' mother is not a Facebook friend. We're divorced. I can't add her as a parent. I found online that this issue has been fixed a while back but it is not working for me. I can't even add her as a contact to her kids. We're not blocking each other and I can reach her on messenger but she doesn't show up on the parent list.,
"Its a great app, I use it to call my Dad since he lives a while away. I feel like it could be improved, though. It could have dark mode, you could connect it to something other than Facebook because LITERALLY NOBODY uses facebook. You could also let people use screenshots and what-not instead of just a picture. Otherwise, it's a good app for when you don't want your kid to have other apps that could lead to messaging strangers daily.",
"Deleted after install. While creating account, couldnt get pass the take a photo for profile screen. Repeatedly shown error and said there was no internet connectivity. Obviously there's connectivity since I was able to download and add a facebook account. Bugged right from the start.",
I really love the app and it's a great tool for younger kids to be able to talk to each other and to make sure nothing bad is happening. The only thing I would improve is giving the kids more options on the app. Like the background of there messages and color for their text boxes.,
"It is a good app to chat with your freinds and family. Sometimes it glittches so much that i have to close everything and wait several minutes to reopen it. Very kid freindly but definetly needs a new update to fix problems. I chat on it alot but me and my freind have found a problem where it will keep hanging us up after chatting for a while. We eventualy have to switch to Gmail, Duo, or Zoom.",
"This app is very nice. We can create our own kids account and chat with our friends. But there are a few things that I don't like. I can't delete my messages, and I can only do video calls. There is no option of voice calling and I'd love it if you would add it. And also while doing a call, I can't minimize the call to see other things or check the chat. So I'd love it if you'd update the app and add these features. The rest is fine.",
"This app is garbage. Literally half the time I don't actually a notification, either it doesn't make a notification sound, it doesn't show me the text notification, or just doesn't show me that the message was sent until an hour later. Today somebody sent me a message and it didn't bother appearing until an hour later. If you're fine with this go ahead, but if you would like to actually get notifications do not use this.",
"Laggy, takes forever to find friends, cant send some emojis, my version glitches and I sometimes don't get notifications and I can't change my color, you can only video call, on some devices you can use pictures from your gallery for your profile picture but on others you cant, you cant send links, to add people to a group chat you have to have everyone in the chat friends with the person you want to add, and other things that I cant think of. The only thing I like about it is the giant thumbs.",
The app was super easy to set up the first time around. But trying to move the service to a new device has proven to be the most difficult time-consuming thing I've had to do in a very long time. I've reached out to Facebook but I've gotten no support on how to fix this problem. It is an awesome app when it worked. It seems like I'm not the only one having this problem cuz most of the one star reviews all complain about the same thing. Facebook time to step up and fix this!!!,
"Super glitchy and annoying. I have difficulty on my account switching between my 2 kids' accounts. It repeatedly asos me to log in to authorize the device. The log in screen never works and the code it's supposed to send for ""forgotten password"" never comes through. I can use the option to log in with my email and password, which works, but then I end up back in the cycle of not being able to switch accounts because it asks me to authorize again.",
I like the app it's made it easy for my daughter to facetime friends and family... BUT it's very hard to figure out were to find the parent controls... it takes me forever to figure out where they are every time I want to change something.,
Shockingly back for a Facebook app. Literally zero help from customer service after many messages. Will let my kids message people in Australia but wont in the UK. Asked for assistance on many occasions but 99% have been ignored. Typical large corporate company where you can not get in touch with anyone and help assistant is terrible thought both platforms.,
"I LOVE this! This app works perfectly fine... Except one issue, where it stops. The sound from the video, is silent. AND you have to turn it back on. AND with the voice message... It stops in the middle. Thank you!",
I love that my child can engage with his friends without needing me as a go between. I am however frustrated that I cannot turn the notifications off in my Samsung Galaxy S8+ and rely on no interruptions. The app overrides all of my settings and will even call over top of another phone call. I have to delete the app off my phone while I'm at work. I am hoping this 'bug' can be fixed.,
To enjoy this app more make sure you Add every person you might want to let your kid to talk too. Otherwise it is VERY difficult to add friends and family later. I tried opening up the parent controls to add people I forgot and couldn't do it. I was able to invite people but that didn't make it so they pop up. A matter of fact I did invite a kid and the kid called and it still didn't make it so I could have my daughter call that kid on the app back. He could only call us.,
The app won't let me sign in. I have changed my Facebook password so I know it is not that. I put all my info in and it starts to sign in then kicks me right back to the login. I have tried using the one time code and it does the same thing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times. No customer service,
"I downloaded this app for my child...when I opened the app it wouldn't work! It wouldn't let my child in, it would say ""account creation failure. Something went wrong while we were creating your child account. Please try again"" then I tried it again and again then I restarted my phone and the same thing popped up, then I reinstalled the app and it still won't work!! 1 star review!!! üò°üò°üò°",
"Currently 1 star. Usually 5 when it's working. We got a new phone and I am currently on an endless ""authorize device"" loop. I know the log in credentials are correct. I spent way too long trying to figure out our but seeing below it looks to be a common issue now. It's just frustrating and sad it won't work.",
I like being able to video call my kids when I'm away from home. video quality and sound are not always that great though. sometimes it won't ring on their end when I call. it's also a big app and takes a lot of space. we like the filters and the kids and I have a lot of fun with those,
Messagengr Kids is really good for kids and was great but now there is a problem when I type the letters are supposed to pop up but they don't and I don't see the send button. So I keep uninstalling it every time the letters don't pop up and I absolutely dislike doing that. So if you could please fix that,
"I don't like how wen i got the app and i did all of the missions that for 5 months it stayed at come back for more missions. I also don't like that my app goes to sleep at 8:30. Especially because i don't even go to bed then. It usually wakes up at 10:00 but, i can't even send messages or videos or even calls. Plus i think that when i wake up at 6:30 i should be able to call my friends! Now i do like the games that i came send to my friends. How ever i loved games especially the 2 little pig",
"Messenger Kids Log in Bug: Unable to log into the app. After entering correct credentials, the app returns to the log on page after each attempt. When I review authorized devices, the device is authorized. The problem continued. 1. Verified the latest version installed. 2. Cleared the app cache and attempted to log in, same behavior occured. 3. Installed app on a different device and attempted to log in, same behavior observed.4. Deleted and reinstalled the app. No improvements. META FIX APP",
"The worst ever. Don't install. Used it for months and no issues and there was an update. The app will no longer allow me to log in at all ........ I've deleted the account and created a new one... nope. The support area is garbage. No one will help you if you have an issue. No chat support, no call line. Nothing. Just I guess we can never use it again.",
The app glitches constantly. And it logged me out and won't let me sign back in. Stays in a loop with login email/password and keeps going between that never actually logs in. Even the password reset didn't work from my email. Some features and accessibilities are not available in Android as they are in Apple. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Android has less app features,
"The app does not show on my s7. I can only use it if someone msgs me. but i am not able to use any features. It will not go past take a pic. We take the pic, click on we agree and then it goes right pack to take a pic, then back to we agree....u get the idea. Frustrating, how to fix this?",
"My child LOVES this because she is able to message her friends. She isn't able to message anyone that isn't on her contact list (which is set up by me and everyone has to be approved by me) She is on my Facebook messenger but it's her own inbox. I can see how many messages have been sent back and forth between people, calls & videos. They can't send certain images or any links. This has been amazing for her to talk to family, friends and us (her parents) GREAT APP! üëç",
"I like it but sometimes I don't get messages even when my app is fully updated. I set all my notifications on but when I'm on another app, it doesn't pop up. I have had this app for a year and it just now started this issue. I hope it gets fixed soon",
"Messenger kids is a good app, overall. There's just one problem. Every time I open up any type of other app while using messenger kids, my screen will flash black and return to the game and will keep flashing black a few times and won't stop. Another thing is I can't share my screen and when I try to use a filter that requires touching the screen, when I touch it, nothing happens. Please fix these bugs, but overall messenger kids is a great app. Have a great day, and please fix the bugs! :D",
"It's great, it's easy, and fun it's basically like, messenger, but for kids the only thing I don't really like is when your parent or guardian signs you up they need to sign you up with facebook. But some people don't have facebook. More people have an email account. So they should let you use an email instead of facebook. Overall, though, it's a pretty good app!",
"Not working. My daughters friends use this app and wanted my daughter to have it so they can communicate, I've downloaded it and then reinstalled it so many times thinking I was doing something wrong as it keeps regenerating the login page and won't let me past it. Nothing I have done works. Then I saw all the reviews and realised I'm not the only one. Please fix this app.",
Please fix this issue!! The app keeps looping back to my log in. Obviously you can see this is happening to many people who just want to be able to interact with their children in a safe setting. My daughter is very upset she cannot interact with her friends. Please fix this ASAP!!!,
"I LOVE this app for my son. He is able to chat with his cousins that moved downstate, his grandparents and his friends during summer break. He is able to message me at work if he has a question, and his dad and I can see it all. He will be heading to his great grandmas downstate soon, and this is perfect for us to be able to talk to him. This was an awesome idea for an app...there are a few things I would fix but all in all, we love it.",
"It works great on one of my kids Samsung E lite tablets but I can't even open it on the other. I've installed, uninstalled and reinstalled about 20 times and every time I tap to open, nothing. the screen flashes and then right back to the tablets home screen. Brand new tablet. Can't imagin it's something with it. regular messenger opens fine. not a happy parent.",
Me and my friends really do like this app! It really fun all of us to connect. It has one problem for me I don't know what my friends. Though its when you send a picture you can't zoom in. So I was thinking you so you can zoom in for the pictures. But otherwise that problem it's perfect for me and my friends. But I wish there was more games otherwise. It's fun I love it perfect for friends and family. If you have friends or family get it. Its perfect. Well I love it my friends do to! :3 <o(*‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶),
"I am having the same issue others are having. I downloaded this on my daughter's new device but the app will not let me log in to verify. It finds my FB account, I enter my password, it starts ""thinking,"" and then kicks me back to the login screen. Makes having this app useless if parents can't log in to verify. Very frustrating.",
"It stopped texting. I can't text. It would normally immediately let me start texting as soon as I opened a contact, but now, I have to tap the word box, It will type one letter, then I have to tap it again continuously for it to type another letter. Please fix this, it bothers me.",
"Thanks for creating the app. It helpful I can talk to my friends and family. But.... there's a bug/glitch that you guys needs to fix. Sometimes it doesn't let me send messages. It says ""unable to send message"". Like please fix it, I can't handle it anymore.",
This app has given nothing but issues logging in it loops back to enter email over and over again. I would like to be able to have my child use her tablet to talk with friends and family instead of my phone. I'd rate higher once the issues get addressed and the ability to log in on a tablet is fixed,
ü§öOverall I love the ability to video my son when we're not together and being able to control who he talks too. I noticed I am unable to change his photo and I am very eager too do so. Hopefully that is added soon. Also the sleep timer is great but custom timers to keep my son from calling certain family members during work hours with the option of adding holidays too or not would be absolutely useful!! Also adding a parent or guardians as exceptions to said timers for emergencies‚ù£Ô∏èüôåüíõ,
"** Update: Just found the controls for my issue!! LOL 5 stars now!!** I like this app but I just wish there was some way to make it show that my daughter is offline when she doesn't have her tablet or when she is studing on it. Her friends call her at times she is not allowed to be online and it rings to my, and my husbands phone, causing disruptions. If her friends see she's offline, they won't try and call her. Not sure if this is already an option and I just haven't figured it out yet.",
It refuses to let me log in. Keeps on asking for adult account verification. I give it the password I do the one-time password and it just keeps kicking me back in a constant loop. It's not the device. It does the same thing on multiple devices. We have even tried the parent account. And nothing. I have even deleted my sons account and started over and still nothing. What is the fix?,
"It keeps crashing. It knocks my children off of the messenger lately. Fix this issue & make it compatible with all tablets & laptops too, not just android phones. This app started out really well but then dropped really bad. Went from a 5 star rating to a 2 star rating from me & if it continues, I will drop it down to a 1 star rating.",
"Overall, this app is pretty good. I feel since it is controlled by parents, there should be a way parents can view ALL conversations without needing to log into the child's account. It is great we can see images, but seeing the conversations is super important as well.",
"Super fun! I can litterally call my besties and text them well.... WHENEVER! Super cool filters! Totally recommended. I am a child on one of my family members account, this game is soooo fun! Ever since I downloaded it I cannot remember a day where I didn't play it. So fun and easy! And even if you go out and decide to play games on the same device you don't hang up! Your camera might turn off but its completely fine! You can still hear eachother smoothly. NO GLITCHES WHATSOEVER.",
"The app is fun. But I have a few complaints: - When your video is off on facetime if your friend(s) take a photo it'll send to the chat but even though your camera was off it will show you looking into the screen or away. Just whatever you were doing while the photo was taken. - Somebody made an account and friended me as one of my friends. They were really weird but I got rid of them. Just try and make it harder for identity fraud on the app. That is all, I hope this app will improve.",
"I'd love to be able to give a glowing review, but i can't even get past the verification/account set up stage, it just keeps giving me a message of ""account creation failure"" tried countless times, uninstalled/reinstalled, skipping the b'day part but to no avail and of course there's info on everything BUT this issue!",
"So, you cannot delete photos or videos your child sends. I had to delete entire chats by removing people from her account. I am not sure that even works. Than I now cannot add that person back. So you actually have less rights to the information on this app than the regular messanger app. The kids will still have access to your phones pictures just by clicking okay to use storage as it pops up. Not a very good app at all and very disappointed in most aspects of this app. Use other is able.",
"It's a good app but multiple problems like; I can't change my favorite color or app color, all my games and other special things on the top disappeared, I can't see my chats with other people unless they send a notification to me and I can't call people or access my friends to make a group like used to be able to.",
"I like a lot about everthing thing about it, it's just that my device is a chromebook and it's hard to use the camera sometimes with it mirroring words every time I'm on it.It also glitches out, like for some time my camera wouldn't work at all because of it.So,it would be great if those bugs can be fixed.",
"Wouldn't let me log in to messenger kids. We've used it before, but today it kept sending me back to put my email and password in multiple times on multiple devices. I uninstalled, installed, cleared storage and cache, I turned the devices off and on and what's worse is there's no way to contact anyone. I'm really disappointed in the app. And my daughter loved to use it to connect with friends",
"Very good for my kiddo! She loves to text her friends, at the beggining it is already set up for others in your contacts. Easy to remeber code so friends can chat. Each child has a code and they give their friends their code so that they can have a good time. My kid is always on it. Its also very helpful for intertainment! There is an activity center with tons of games. I rate this app a 9/10",
App won't ring or notify. At this point it's pretty useless. It seems they have changed their settings for notifications and sound because all the instructions I'm finding do not match what I see in the app by following the steps. Sound is all the way up and notifications are allowed.,
This app is amazing i love it. I use it to talk to my adult family and also my cousins and my step sister who dont have phones like i do. We love that you can make groups and name them. I love all the filters and games you can play in chat and on video chat. i have only had 2 very small problems one was it logging me out but it was very easy to log back in and the other one was i would call someone and the screen would be black but i just had to hang up and call right back. Over all this is an amazing app and i would recommend it to anyone,
This app has been amazing for my kids allowing them to keep in touch with family and friends but I have recently encountered a dilemma with the app not allowing Bluetooth headsets (which my child saved his money to buy). This may lead to a huge deal breaker for me. I can only listen to them ramble with their friends for so long lol. I would happily give 5 stars if this problem gets solved.,
messanger kids is such a useful app. To make sure our kids are not talking to random strangers and that we know who they are talking too and we can add people to there friends list. Very useful. The fact that the parents control it is even better! I think this app is very worth it!,
"It was working just fine and suddenly now, it no longer allows me to login. Keeps taking me back to the authorize page. Kids are super bummed because they haven't been able to use the app in a week now. I've deleted and reinstalled the app, still not working. So annoying.",
I love this app! Its available for kids to talk and have fun without having weird things being sent or messages. But there are some things that make it less fun of the experience. Well first my granddaughter is talking to her friends but it says that her messages can not be sent and it wont tell me why. Also my granddaughter wants all her friends in a group chat but it's to complicated to have all of them friend just to make one group chat. I feel like they should add whoever they want. üòä,
Great app to stay in touch with my kids. I just wish it would always pop up the chat head with a notification sound on my child's phone instead of just a notification at the top of the screen. My message just gets buried in all of their game notifications up there and so they don't reply because they don't know they have a message. I also wish I could send links to them via kids messenger.,
It is a great app I can text with my friends and cousins but there are 2 problems.1)I can't make a group like whenever I try to the screen gets white it only happens with me my friends can make a group.2)I can't send my friends any pic I have to first save them in gallery then I can send it to my friends but it doesn't happens with friends. Please fix it.,
"It's okay. I really hate that you can only manage your kid's account via the Facebook app (which I don't use). I had to install the app specifically to add a contact and then couldn't figure out how to do it afterall. So, it was a waste of an install. My kids can contact me and that's it. Which is fine, I just wanted to add their aunt as well. Please allow the messenger controls to be accessed via mobile browser. This is how I use and prefer to use Facebook.",
"It is very fun and easy for everyone to message each other, there are fun memes, emojis, and stickers. You can edit your pictures with fun drawings and stickers and send it to your friends. Messenger kids is also family friendly, whenever a child wants to add a friend, it informs the parents and waits for their approval. The app also informs the parents whenever the child hss blocked someone. This app is very fun and great and I highly recommend it to families.",
"This app is a easy way to contact my friends! But one small problem, it won't allow me to use some filters. And also, messenger kids blocks out emojis like these ones, üíâüíäüí© which I'm fine with, but how can I fix the filter thing? In the corner there's a lightning logo witn an x beside it, so I click on it and the x disappears, but it still doesn't help and the x appears again. Please help me with this problem because I like those filters the most. Thank you",
"It doesnt always turn on when it is meant to which is very anpying and it gliches alot when on calls (it does not have anything to do with the internet) and hangs up if it gliches for 30 seconds or less and there are not alot of colours to pick from to decorate the app . On the other hand the app is helpful like when children doent have sim cards in their devicce and can not call family or friends as to this app does not need a sim card as well as it has great emojis , gifs , and stickers .",
"App is amazing! You can even do group calls! 3 to maybe 6! But if you want 6 you have to have 6 people and they have to well all 6 people have to have each other on the app, and it's way easier to contact with my sis! And it has mini games on it like make healthy habits! Or make a pet! Or something like that oh and a draw game!! You pic a drawing to draw like a car or a cat and you send it to who ever and they guess what it is! And the parents control the kids profile TOTALLY recommend!!!!!!!!!!",
My daughter has an account. We are trying to set it up on a new phone but it will not let us. I even loged out of the app o my phone and tried to log back in and it will not work. I am using the exact same name format and birthdate but it keeps coming up With a failure message. Have uninstalled and reinstalled but it will still not work. Very frustrating coming into the holidays!,
My friend was changing with her video off but it didn't say it was off which led to complete imbarasment towards her and unability to speak l felt so bad and i really want this glitch fixed for my sake as well as others.once deciding to join she barely talked but she found the courage to say that we should inform/ warn others of this glitch so they don't have to feel so weird around their best friends great over all but that is the only problem and it is an invasion of privacy.plz get ths fixed!,
"Endless login loop. I login and it confirms, I get the two factor login, it then loops back to the login screen. There aren't any errors. Correct login info is entered. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and the issue persists. Useless app until it's fixed.",
"I have had no problems logging my kids into their devices in the past,however, I am currently trying to set up a new device for my son and the app keeps looping me through the parental varification. I have tried multiple times,even from my own device and the same issue occurs. Hope this gets resolved soon, I am very dissapointed as my son was really looking forward to being able to chat with his friends.",
"It's nice that I can manage the contacts. I just wish that phone calls would ring, beep or vibrate when people are offline- to notify them that a call is coming through. If the recipient isn't logged into messenger, you can only really leave a message for them.",
"Honestly this app is simple, and easy for parents to use and even more easy is the log-in method that the parent is put in, because if the child uninstalls the app, it's super easy to just log them back in and get back the progress, but parents cannot see who their child is calling without just asking them or looking at their screen, which could be a disadvantage. The calls have fun filters and is sure to keep you at work, some games are even disguised as filters on call, and the games are fun. You can manage your child's account including adding details, choosing if they can add links to their text ,access and remove contacts and more. But if they allow their children to add links, then the child has to answer a question to open a link, But some of the questions could be too easy to ask a parent for help, I think this feature could be better if the parents chose the question. And to parents, if your child is 14 or older, this app isn't for them.",
"I love this app, I use it for my friends, but the problem I have is sometimes I'll be texting for too long, you say I'm not able to send it's really annoying, and it really doesn't go away until like a few days later, or something like that, I either have to reset my phone are make sure it's just app doesn't need update.",
"I am a child using this app and I think it's amazing. I can text, call, send videos, pictures, drawings, and gifs. If your child keeps begging to get a phone to text friends and family, this is the app that you are looking for. No need for a phone or maybe an unsafe app for your child to be texting on. It can be glitchy but overall this is amazing. I highly recomend you to download the app.",
"Terrible app! First of all, the app takes up 9GB of storage on my phone, that's after 2 years of useage. It doesn't delete messages so wastes storage. When there is a bug it doesn't get fixed for a LONG time. It also has a horrible moderation system. One time I said ""Yes"" with a photo of a funny face attached to it and it said it was inappropriate. When you try to open links it asks dumb questions ( Ex is an igloo made of mustard fries or ice ) This app makes me feel 5. DONT DOWNLOAD!",
Great idea needs work. While in the app it lists some of my kids contacts but not all of them. It also does not open chat heads or give any kind of notification when someone sends a message while you aren't on you don't know I have multiple kids so as a parent it's frustrating trying to manage their accounts. If I manage one it signs me into theirs as them and then won't let me sign out to check on another ones account. I had to uninstall and reinstall. It has lots of potential but needs work.,
"When I first got this app it was pretty nice to call, text overall a good app. But you cannot turn off your video and calls and the colors for your theme are limited I'm pretty sure there's only 12 colors, maybe add like a color wheel. This is my biggest criticism because the new update is it so annoying everything's blue you cannot change your color and this is just not fun the layout is more like the regualr messenger. Please reach out to me if you know how to change your color thank you.",
"It's good, when it works. The phone has internet connection (to the house wifi and mobile data) but she can't video call because it says that it needs connected to the internet.i can get on chrome and search Google or yahoo, so the internet is connected. I have restarted the phone and updated the app. Not sure what else to do.",
"The extra features are weird. The games and filters tend be be pretty laggy sometimes. Other times they simply dont load. A pet peeve of mine is that the app ALWAYS makes sound when I send something. REGARDLESS of my phone's settings. Other than that, it's pretty good.",
"My daughter cannot call, message, or video call any of her contacts. This has been going on for almost a month. We've tried 3 devices, wifi and data, different locations (in KY/TN), delete and re-download, and uninstall/reinstall. Nothing has worked. This is the only way my kid can contact most of her friends. Please help!",
It is amazing my kids love it! I use it to communicate too and there were never problems :) You might think I'm overeacting but this is amazing the only thing I would think to change is to seperate the message and the facetime button but overall this app is amazing!,
"Well how do I start? I was on a video call with my friends and the games were CONSTANTLY BREAKING. Then, her audio got all messed up. Then the call crashed. We aren't able to talk without it crashing. Ill change my rating once these terrible bugs get fixed.",
"the app is fine, i can text my friends but theres this one dumb glitch that keeps happening, whenever im onna call with somebody, we'll be on a call for not even 5 minutes and the call starts making my phone screen go black and then back to whatever i was on. and then it goes black again. I've been dealing with this for over 7 months and i want it fixed now.",
"Alright so this app is amazing when I want to message my friends but recently I got signed out I tried signing in but it just says""could not sign you in right now. I think it's a bug but I'm not sure. This did not just happen to me but it also happend to my friends. Theres not a lot of messaging apps like messanger kids so my friend don't have another way to message",
"This is the best chat app ever, I love it! I only have 1 problem which is pretty annoying to me: Some people use this app on bigger tablets and it can be a pain turning it to portrait mode when opening the app, plus it being harder to type in portrait mode. So can you add landscape mode compatibility to the app, because we usually use tablets in landscape mode most of the time and it can ne a pain turning to portrait mode on this app.",
"I love texting all my friends. Best app ever! One complaint: When I leave a group I always get added back and I don't want to be added back. It is so annoying to be added back every time I leave. When you add somebody to the group, you should have to be given a request to join a group, not automatically joined in it.",
"You can disable video and pictures but the child, literally, just has to push a button to turn it back on. Kids are natural button pushers and don't even need to to read to be able to turn it on. As we teach her limits and boundaries, I want to be able to control this feature.",
"This app would be great, if It would allow me to get past device authorization. I successfully set up an account for my daughter, but she can't use it. Trying to get in fully installed was extremely frustrating. I hope you fix this problem soon so we can actually use the app.",
"Overall it is not a bad app for kids to communicate with each other. However, not sure if you have that in mind, but a time slot build into the app would be great. So we can set times and friends know when to call. Or a Do Not Disturb mode.",
"Login re looping! It's been a week. Randomly for logged out and cannot log back in. Reset password, one time code via email and text. Uninstall and reinstall. Updated phone. Deleted other apps. Reset phone. All multiple times. Please fix. I'm reading the reviews and your ratings are going down and so many others are having the same problem.",
"Hi your app is fine but there is some things. 1 there is a glitch we're you can't make groups. 2 when ever I'm on a call and I go off of the app to play another game with my friend on the call, They can't ever hear me and I always have to keep going back on the call so they can hear me agian. 3 You can't delete texts or change your friends name to me that's kinda frustrating. I hope you can fix these, have a wonderful day.",
"This is an amazing app. I'm able to contact all, my friends and family while staying safe and having fun. Your parent controls who you get to talk to, and they can check your messages. Mine don't however, which make the experience way better!",
"I think this app is an excellent invention. I use it to keep in contact with my younger nieces. However, as of lately, it hasn't been notifying me when they call or message me. Therefore I'm unable to speak to them when they want to talk to me. Is there anyway I can change the settings so I can receive notifications when the app is not open?",
Great app but you need to make it so you can have someone who isn't a friend of some else able to add to a group/create a group with them in it with someone new because half my friends aren't friends with each other and I wanna add them all in 1 group it would make it a lot easier for me and everyone else on this app.,
"Definitely recommend this app!! Safe and secure way for any child to connect with friends or family members while letting them have the freedom to video or text chat, send stickers, pictures, videos, and play games with friends all within the app! You have the option of letting your child add their own friends or selecting only parents can add friends! I have to give my son an approval code before he can add a friend himself. Parents can also set usage limits as well.",
"Its been a great app for us! My 8yr old uses this app on his own phone to get ahold of us parents, grandparents, cousins and friends. He doesnt read very well and still finds a way to figure everything out on his own. He can however call people over and over again with causes grandma to be irritated lol so I have to keep a close eye on each conversation to make sure hes not blowing people up lol but he loves that he basically has service on his phone thanks to this app!",
This app is alright but I have a few complaints. One is that you have to take a picture of yourself or an object you can not insert like a screen shot of a wolf or something like that. The calls dont work late at night they wont connect. I would reccomend this app for younger kids not teens or older. I would not recommend this app overall. THIS IS JUST MY OPINION DO NOT COME AT ME!,
"For over a week I've attempted to reauthorize the device my child uses. This new bug cause their account to log out unexpectedly. Now, I cannot log into their device using the one-time password or the password set for my own account. The furthest I was able to achieve was receiving the 2-step authentication code; only to be booted back into the original log in screen. This is extremely frustrating due to the fact that we use this so my child can keep in touch with family who lives out of state",
Very good app that kids can message their friends with! Although I do have some suggestions. 1. Dark mode and other themes. Themes have been on the iOS version for many months now. 2. Voice call button and video call button. This has also only been on iOS version currently. 3. Custom ringtones.,
"Great for kids however need adult assistance because if you try to create a new group or search for a friend the screen goes red and you need to shut down and reopen. The same thing happena if they do the Activites and try to ""send to a friend"" to play with them. It's really annoying.",
"I love the app, especially that if I have it on my phone I can access every message she sends and receives. I would really appreciate the option to shut down the app at certain times though, like during school hours or after 8pm.",
"Those adds show a perfect conection over cellular for a video call. I struggle getting HALF that quality over a internet connection. ( Of 70 MB) I have a phone with a all day battery and the video calls drain my 5-7 hour battery iN 30 MINUTES, while also making it very hot. The messeging isn't very good either",
This application is no longer working correctly with our Samsung tablet the microphone does not work during video calling and the app freezes and glitches. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the application we have reset the tablet to factory default nothing has worked. Please fix this.,
A really good app! My daughters friends and her can see eachother with the facetime and can communicate with friends she haven't seen in a long time. The filters are fun and the app is all kid friendly. As long as you and and your daughters friends have Facebook you can connect. I highly recommend this.,
"I am able to contact long distance with friends and family which is awesome,but it can be hard to get other people friended when you have parent mode and if someone doesn't know there code but need to tell someone it can be troublesome.Oyher then that I enjoy the games,questions,video calls and more.",
"Just downloaded it. I have no other way to connect with my friends besides the schools set up Microsoft teams and people never go on there (lol). When I will be able to have someones code or something i will add them, but i test called my dad and its amazing! I only wish that there was a color wheel instead of 12 different colors only. Please add that in! It would be amazing üòä",
I love this app because I love to text my friends all day. This is the app that I go on for almost all day. I love this app. But they really have to fix alot of issues 1 the mic is not working the whole call 2 when your video is off it is soo glitchy because again the mic is not working,
I mean it's a great app all my friends have it and we call each other but I'm on a Android phone and for some reason it does not let me change my profile picture to something in my gallery but for some reason iPhone users have the freedom to do that also when I call I can't hear very well my friends please fix the problems that I listed and it will be perfect,
"SO. This app is good and secure, though it doesn't have as much helpful features as Messenger, like it doesn't have the reply feature, share screen feature, etcetera. Please do add any of these features. But really, good job.",
I had the app for my daughter and then I went to add my son and it wouldn't allow me to add him. I kept getting a message error and then I was forced to delete my daughter's account and now it will not allow me to remake her one. This is so frustrating since this is the only way my daughter can communicate with her friends outside of school. This issue definitely needs to be fixed!!,
"So far this app is great! My daughters best friend moved away and so when they want to talk myself and her bf's mom would let the kids use our phones to call, this app is much better. It gives them a since of being big kids and allows them to stay on a call much longer. So my phone isnt tied up and i dont miss calls.",
Alot of great and improved safety features. My nieces set up the app so that my great nieces and nephews and I can chat. The most annoying aspect of this app is the numerous messages prompting me to set up more friends for my child. I took the app off my phone. Talking on the phone is less intrusive. Please fix this.,
"The app was ok when I started using it now every time I get on there's a black screen then it kicks me off. It started after the update, now it wasn't showing up on my screen just like the other people are saying, so I deleted it than re-downloaded the app and I'm still having the same problems. It's really Making me mad so please fix it before anyone else suffers the same problems",
"I would give it a 5 star if the app worked a little better. Every time my grandson calls me through video... the phone rings but I have to open the app and click on his profile in order to answer. It does not appear on my screen. By the time I get into it, he hangs up.",
It's a nice option as opposed to having a facebook page for a younger child. I do wish there was more parental controls or able to see conversations from the FB app instead of looking at their chat log. Most of the family is connected through facebook so that's a plus they can contact the child with parent approval.,
"Constant Error logging in message. When it is working, my kids love it. I told it to log out of all devices though and now get a constant error message when I try to log in. I restarted the computer, deleted the app and reloaded it. Nothing is helping.",
"I love the fact that I can do emojis, voice recording, and pics. But their is one problem. My speaker doesn't work on calls, but it does in videos and voice recordings. I would really like you to tell me how to fix that, or remove it.",
It is a very good app. I really enjoy it although I with there were more colors to chose from. I also wish we could delete messages. It would be cool if we could save videos or the voice recordings.,
"It is awesome I get to see my friends but, we never have the same filters. I had a filter that I loved but, I lost it and my friend didn't. Can you not change the filters so quickly. My favorite filter was the orange striped cat with the bell and bow. If you see this please keep that filter there forever please. Thank you!",
"Love the app. I wish there was more on screen options to do during a call. Like drawing, more face fun filters. Also more back and forth games so the kids can take turns sending their response on their own time",
This is a wonderful app I recommended it to everyone. I have one complaint every time I make a video it freezes. Also whenever I edit a video and add fun stickers and music it always goes away when I send it to people. But overall this is a wonderful app.,
"Could have been better I really want some more games and effects like in the regular messenger and I get frustrated with this next thing I can't add my profile photo from my gallery it has to be taken through the app and that is very bad and sometimes else lately it has stopped sending me notifications when someone texts me and that is a big problem. Update, I used to love this app but now I hate it I litterly don't get notifications when someone from my family or friends send me something. üò°üò°",
"The only problem is my mom can easedrop on my conversations with my friends and cousins. She doesn't care, but this is the only app that I can connect with my cousins and I can't tell them anything I wouldn't want anyone to know. But other than that, it's amazing. I love how it let's us take pictures. I don't like when it notifys the other user when you take a pic because it's really fun to take weird pics of her. So I recommend this app and it's really fun",
"Really nice for kids who are too young to have a facebook account to keep in touch with friends and family, I just wish there were a PC accessible version as it's easier to monitor my kid in front of a computer than with a phone in her hand. Would be 5/5 but I don't like the lack of PC support.",
"It's a way to talk to your friends. I mean, it's the best app in the world. This is one of my almost favorite apps in my app store, does it always talk to my friends after school is super cool, you can choose colors, everything you can also make group chats, it is so cool, I definitely think you should try this app",
"Happy to have it. Kids love being able to talk to their cousins, gparents, aunts and uncles... super glitchy though.. having a hard time adding general contacts. Lots of error messages, etc. Would be great if it functioned as well as regular messenger in wayward of adding friends and family but overall okay! Kids love it.",
"Overall, I think this app was efficient and usefull. But, like other users the app crashed and I no longer can talk to my friends and family. I find it frustrating and difficult to work around. Please fix this so myself and other users can use it.",
"I like the controls and safety. I cant get the profile picture to change unless it's to a picture taken right then on the camera. i should be able to upload from gallery and it wont let me. also, messages will be sent to my daughter, but when she goes to see message, it disappears? how is she suppose to respond if she doesnt even get to read the message? when composing a new message, all her contacts do not show up, only random ones. I'm very frustrated with this app.",
"Good app for kids to be able to use the voice to text option, however if a friend or family responds with text, there is no text reading option. Therefore young kids that can't read or can't read well are unable to know what their friends or family are sending them. Please add an option where kids can have the text read out to them.",
I really think it's a great app to talk to your friends and all. But there is a bug where me and a friend got really got really mad and she removed me but every 2 to 3 weeks I get a notification of the last text she sent me and this happened like May 26th 2020 at 9:30 I kept getting that message 2 times every 2 to 3 weeks and when I was trying to call one of my best friends the message keep popping up rapidly but now I can't get the message.,
"I love that my kiddo can call family and friends and text back and forth. It's truly been an amazing tool over these past 2 years to keep my daughter connected and socializing. However, I'm disappointed that the calls to her no longer show on my phone and my ability to do much of anything through the parent dashboard is nil to none. Idk what changed but all the above has left me feeling like I have no ability to screen what is shared or monitor conversations. My daughter is only 8.",
Absolutely useless currently. On a new download on new phone can not login. Just constantly goes back to the login page. On an old download can only get into one of the kids accounts the other one comes up with error and needs an adult to log in - I can then log in but selecting the same child it just comes up with error again and puts me on a loop,
"Very good, motion tracking is almost perfect too. But if you click on the video call on somebody's tab it may say ""no connection"" but when you go to messages and do the same you can connect.",
"This app is amazing. You can call and text your friends, and there are cool effects and games when you Facetime. There is one thing I hate about it though. You have to have a parent with a Facebook acount or it does not work. And a lot of my friends and cousins do not have a Facebook acount. And that is my rating. I hope I helped!But it takes some time loging in one time it tock 30 min!and no adds WOOOOO but you can't delet texts wich I might by axaidint did that so YEAH but overall its great.",
"It really is a good way to talk to my friends, but please add the voice changer for Android. There's also a bug that delays the message for a few HOURS OR MINUTES üò°üò°üò° until it sends. It is annoying. Please fix it. | (Add a customizable background so we can turn it to dark mode, or any other color please.) üòÅ",
It's a really good and fun because there is activity and you can have a lot of fun when you call someone! It's a good app for younger kids who want to be able to text to there friends and family members üòã I think every kid should have messenger kids. It's a good thing that the creater had done for the kids and myself.,
"I do really like this app because you can text,take funny pictures and do other cool things.It is very easy to add friends and anyone else.However, when you call people the video quality and sound is not that good at all.Also,sometimes you don't really know if someone is texting you.Sometimes it will have the 3 little dots (someone responding to you)but they actually not texting you .Overall this app is good.Just letting you know if you get this app don't have very high expectations.",
"This app sounds great, but errors at the step for finalizing account creation. The error is nondescript: ""Something went wrong. Please try again."" I've uninstalled/reinstalled, deleted cookies and data, logged out of Facebook and fb messenger, turned off all parental controls, made sure there are no control apps installed, messaged support, and read every post in the forums on this (seems to be a common problem). Good idea, just too bad it doesn't work.",
HORRIBLE APP. Whenever I open the app it just freezes! I can never view any photos sent too me and NO IT'S NOT THE WIFI. And when I can look at the photos I have to click on them to actually look at them THEN THAT DOESN'T EVEN WORK SO I SIT THERE FOR 30 MINUTES WAITING FOR THIS TRASHY APP TO LOAD üò° I'm so deleting,
Why all of a sudden you cannot log on it keeps looping through the log in screen even after log in it takes you back to log on. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling and even bought a brand new phone to try clearly this is a problem based on your recent reviews? Can we please get a fix or some answers. Does not let you get passed the log in stage,
This app is too childish apparently its for 6-12 year olds but I think there should be an app called messenger for older kids 9-12 and keep the messenger kids for 6-9 year olds. The app has useless features like pets and its too colorful and there isn't an option for a plain color üòï sometimes I don't get notifications its hard to add friends u can't send links u can't have voice calls and u have skipped all the useful features like screen sharing. But all cons aside its a good way to talk with,
"Says it's already installed, but, we can't open the account. . . . When we try to open it, it says it can only be installed on Chrome. That's what it is installed on and that's the browser we are using. We aren't locked out, it's just that we can only see that messages have been sent to my child from some friends. We set up the whole thing with friends and pictures and invitations. Those are the friends sending messages... we just can't see them. Oh Facebook technology- you have failed. It works for one child, but not the other. Too buggy for me.",
"Very good and nice app, I'm giving it three stars bcuz 1. I can't send links to other people, it might be for safety reasons but the parent adds the contacts, it isn't like Facebook when you freind someone they get added to your messenger, 2. Please let me in landscape mode! Maybe make the contacts bigger while in landscape mode?",
It's an ok app but I have a lot of problems 1. When I'm video chatting with people I can't tell if other people have texted me. 2. It's does vibrate and there is not sound when people text. 3. You can't delete messages. 4. I like when you can make nicknames for each other like you can on Facebook Messenger.,
"Can't log in. I enter the username and password and the code, but after I submit, it cycles back to the log in page. I've tried restarting the device, deleting and redownloading the app, deleting the cache and data, and nothing has made a difference. I've tried on three different devices now and nothing works.",
Easy to use and good parental controls. My son loves being able to message me when I'm at work or school or from the other room. And he loves that he can see his family and talk with them. I like that I control who hes in contact with and I can see what hes doing. Hes 8 so this is a great app to help encourage good online behavior. It's been a good experience so far.,
"its good for chatting with friends, but im experiencing issues with the notifications right now. the app isnt giving me notifications for any of my chats/contacts. when i go on the app it takes a minute to load all my unread messages. ive checked for possible updates to fix this, checked my phone system to see if notifications are off there, and made sure none of my chats are muted, but nothing has helped. please fix this issue, as its stopping me from talking to my friends when theyre online.",
This is a really great app and all but the reason for 4 starts is because I am on a Android tablet and for some reason I don't have to option to turn of my camera and I can't turn the app to dark mode. I have updated the app several times and it still says the same. But overall this is a really great app but I would like to be able to turn off my camera and have dark mode on Android devices.,
Good app though there are many flaws. 1.Mulitple games include eating the kids if they fail. 2.There is no way of turing off your video unless you leave the app. 3.There is no read aloud. 4.There is no bitmojis. 5.No voice type (unless its apart of the whole device). 6.I wish there was some sort of spilt setting for a shared account. Which changes the name and contacts without changing the entire account.,
"I LOVE this app for my kids to contact myself or family/friends easily. We ha e used the app for over a year, however right now when they try to message me it closes the app! What good is that when I'm the one they need to talk to most often. PLEASE HELP FIX THIS PROBLEM and I'll change rating to 5 stars.",
"Very good for safe messaging but I can't friend people because some need to be face scanned so not 5 stars but overall good and can really entertain kids with the filters. EDIT: can no longer face time and it's very annoying pls fix. EDIT: ok I did an update and I can't do the pet thing, but filters do worküòäEDIT: the pet thing now works and I am doing another update rn",
I like the app but the are a couple things that need to be fixed. When you are on a call It once in a while lets you use silly faces on a call but over all it does not work. I believe this the only one that really is anooying to people so I wont say the other thing that need to be tweeked. This i s why I will give the app a 3,
"Perfect app (almost) all the games are really cool and the filters are great! All I need to say is I only have problems with the filtering emoticons into emojis. But other than that, it's great for kids who don't have a phone number who want to talk to friends and play games with each other! Download this app 100%!",
"I really enjoy talkin to my friends, but there is always some sort of disconnection for know reason. if you could fix that, that would be great. #2 you cant have it in comuters and that is annoying , so pleeeeeeaaaase fix that! last I think it is great all in all . this is great for children like over six through 18. otherwise this is save for children and i enjoy it too! I love it!",
Love that my little girl is able to keep in touch with her friends and family without having to have a phone. She uses the app on her Tablet and texts and video chats with them all the time! I love that I have to approve the people she can talk to. It helps me keep her safe! It's awesome! One of the best things Facebook has to offer!,
"I was trying to change colour and accidentally tapped ""Switch Account"" and now my parents can't sign me back in with the error: ""Login Failed Can not sign in your child"" Everytime. Tried on two different phones, worked on neither phones. ... Other than that it's really great and I can talk to my friends.",
"This is the best app for kids to chat with there friends and family. It's super safe for them, They can't add there own contacts. The parent controls everything. It's also fun for the kid because they can chat with there friends and family while staying safe like the parent wants. A cool thing about it is there's filters like normal messenger but there filters just made for the kids. This app is great.",
It used to work famously. But the last several times I've used it with my son and me being on the road truck driving when the chat connects I see myself but can't see him. I can hear him but no video from his end. And he has the same issue on his end. He can see himself. But not me. But can hear me. I've uninstalled and put it back on checks for updates and permissions. Everything is in order for it to work properly. Please fix this issue. I miss being able to see my son while on the road,
"There seems to be a glitch happening. I am unable to authenticate the parent account. When I click 'authenticate' it spins for a minute and then goes back to the authenticate page. My parent messenger says I logged into the kids account but we're not able to get into the app to use it. We've been trying for three days now. I've cleared cache and data, deleted, restarted the phones. Nothing works.",
"4 because some stuff (ex: filters and calls) is slow, and for a while, when I started or stopped a call, my screen would be black the I would have to press the on/off button on my phone, but other than that, I love it!!",
"The bad: can't disable video chat. I really wish I could turn it off, or at least have the app kick it to me for permission before sending the call. The good: he can send stickers and messages to grandmas and uncles etc., and play with the filters on the camera. Family doesn't have to download a special app (that is a big plus) and it's safe. Until I have more control over the video chat feature, it gets a B-.",
"It was working great for about a year now all of a sudden one of my daughters can't get onto her messanger. I hard reset her phone, made her a new account, nothing fixed it. I see this is happening to a lot of people. You should fix the issue soon so she can go back to chatting with her friends on wifi.",
"This app is extremely glitchy. I created an account for my son, and suddenly when I message him, at the bottom of our conversation it says ""You can't reply to this conversation."" I'm not blocked, I checked. the only possible thing I can think of that caused this is I have a Facebook account, but I keep it deactivated. But that doesn't make any sense because you can still use regular messenger even if your Facebook is deactivated. The creators need to fix all of the issues!",
"It's good but I have had trouble setting it up on other devices for my son, and I've also had trouble adding a friend for my kid when I'm not friends with someone on fb like the other parent and I don't want to add people to my account just so he can have communication with them.",
"This app is a great way of communicating to your friends if they dont have phone numbers, or you dont want your number gave out. I recommend this app for any kids to talk to their friends. It's even controlled by parents. The parents can see your texts you've sent, all the pictures, and all the videos. You CANT delete messages, but that is just fine to me. I highly recommend this to any kids who want to have something somewhat like messenger.",
"It is a great app overall. I am going to take away one star though because, two of my kids have the new messenger screen with the black background however, my other kid doesn't have it and it's the old white background. We've tried updating but that didn't work either. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Also it states that you can delete text messages however, it doesn't let you. üòï",
"I can't login due to the login loop other users have described. I enter login info, it sends me the authentication code, I enter the code, and then it asks me to log in again. I've used the app successfully before on this very device. But after logging out & trying to log back in, it doesn't work anymore. Uninstalling & reinstalling didn't fix the problem, nor did clearing data. I'll update this rating to five stars when I can actually log in again.",
"Very good app! The phone, calls work perfecly, And so do texts! My only problem is whenever you have to tap the screen, it doesn't work. I uninstsalled it and reinstalled it and it still doesn't work. Please fix this, Thank you‚ù§",
"Can't stop video in a call. That is, there's no audio only call, video had to stay on. And if you leave the app in background to play a game together, the proximity sensor keeps putting the screen black, which is awful.",
This app is good but needs to allow more contacts. My step daughter doesn't live with us and my hubby doesn't have facebook so I had to create a kid's profile for him so she could video/chat with him. I also can't add her mom or that side of the family because I'm not friends with them. I can't add her sister who only has instagram and messenger.,
Whenever I am talking to my bestie it always hangs up. This is really annoying and even more annoying for 2 nine year old BESTIES! I really hate this because it doesn't happen with any of my other normal friends but it happens with BEST FRIEND. I really think this app is trying to tear friends appart and we both think that someone hung up when actually MESSENGER KIDS HAS A PROBLEM! Other than that you also can only VIDEO chat and no audio. I HATE THIS AND YOU SHOULD REALLY UPGRADE IT! IM SO MAD,
"I am a child and I think this app is amazing. it is safe for us to use,but I have a problem. When I try to text my friends,it automatically says ""Unable to send"". It freaks me out because I'm an over thinker so I think my friend either hates me or ignores me and doesnt see my text. I want to say sorry to them but it is just not working. Please fix this bug,if you dont fix it,my review is staying the same,thank you.",
"The Bluetooth headphones won't work with kids messenger on the Samsung Galaxy S7 FE tablet. I've checked the Bluetooth settings and app settings. I've tried many Bluetooth headphones JBL, Sony, and Samsung and they still won't work. there's no setting to forward it over and the headphones,and the headphones are already set to answer calls and play music. Looks like a Bluetooth bug with the software. Otherwise the app is great.",
This app randomly stopped working for video chat. Picture freezes. Cleaned cache. Uninstalled & reinstalled. Changed settings. Did full restore. Same problem no matter what. Every other app works fine. She used this app a lot. Disappointing.,
I love this app! Some downsides here: 1. no option to turn off video. 2. add more face filters. 3. when going back to the home screen of the app with keyboard still open there is a a black gap.,
"Good for kids, but I can't get it to download on any other device that isn't my phone. My daughter doesn't have her own phone as she has no real need for one. We decided to get this app so she could stay more connected with friends during Covid-19, but it is only compatible with my phone. Not her iPad, not my tablet, not my laptop. This means her friends call while I'm out running errands. They message when she's still sleeping. This app needs to be more compatible with other devices.",
"I was really enjoying using this app to chat with my grandbabies every week, but recently we have had more and more problems. For instance, my grandsons are only four and they want to play the games with me....one is autistic and especially loves playing the games with me, but I can tap the app all I want and it won't do anything. I would give five stars if the issues could be fixed. Thank you!",
"Overall, it's a great app. There is just one issue I have with it. It's whenever you are factiming someone and it gets glitchy. I hope you guys can make it less glitchy. That would help a lot. I still very much appreciate this app. It's easy for me to message my friends. But I just want to thank the creator of this app for making this. This app is the only way I can FaceTime my bestie. Love this app and keep up all of your great work and keep on making a lot of progress. But thank you again. üíû",
"App has always had some minor glitches. You couldn't receive calls or messages without actively being in the app. Now the app had logged my child out in their tablet and won't allow us to log back in. It also removed all the chat bubbles from their screen and they can't start a new chat or search for friends. On the parent dashboard it shows that none of the contacts have been deleted or blocked, but my child can't access their contacts.",
"Tried to sign up for my little brother. Kept looping through the signup process. Super annoying. I tried restarting the app, deleting it, and every other possible thing to fix this. This was a waste of my time and an absolute bust.",
"It's fine, but I have problems. 1. The profile picture.s system will not let me choose a screenshot photo or pre-existing photo, and this is very bad. (I hate photos of me) 2. This is less of an app problem, but all my highschool friends use snap chat and facebook, and so I'm just left here to use this with my cousins, and that's it. (3 people) I hope to see some ways that this app can seem less ""kid-ish"" too. By that I mean trying to appeal to older audiences too. App is good in all other ways.",
This app is great! I love that its a safe place and you have to ask a adult to add a new contact. The parent does not need to have KM downloaded. You can just use FB messenger. You get notifications if your child sends a link or trys to chat with a new friend But if you set a emoji (like the preset üëç) it wont show for your child. Or if you set a backround.. You also cant name anybody in KM and thats reasonable but....you can send pictures but the parent cannot send GIFS. Overall i love this app,
"My daughter loves using this app and was having alot of fun talking to her cousins. Unfortunately it was logged out and now it won't let me log in! No matter what I try and I've tried on 3 digger devices. I am so frustrated, I've been trying to log back in for hours and each time it logs itself back out immediately and how's straight back to the login screen.",
"Will not allow me to sign in on my phone, regardless of my passords being correct, and/or getting a temporary one sent to me. There is no way to use this service or to speak to a representative to get out of this loop. Very disappointing. I have removed the app from my phone after wasting too much of my time attemping to get what is an impossible loop to work.",
"It's a good app, meets my expectations. Although I'm not sure if there's a feature to add older people such as my daughter's grandpa, grandma, uncles, aunts and etc. It also delays notifications or whenever somebody is online/offline. Please fix it.",
"This app is very nice, But id like to add when I'm talking to my friends on call, it will kick ms out of the call after 2 minutes, I've restarted my phone, and checked my software update, and I've also uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times, if anybody can fix this, please let me know!!",
"I do really like this app for my daughter. I like that I can approve who she interacts with. however, I do wish there was an option to set a timer for time spent on the app. That would take away the option for her to message me when needed though if she ran out of time. we do not have her set up on a phone plan so she uses this app to communicate with us. Her messages go directly to our regular fb messenger.",
"The app used to be fantastic until the keyboard started spazzing out. when searching for friends to add, It types random letters and words trying to guess what I want and then continues to add letters in excess when I try to delete. This doesn't happen in any other app.",
I love the app messenger kids it is easy and fun to use. But I have noticed at tiny problem when I go in to it and scroll down to find my friends a lot of the time it Cutts of half my friends and then I try and scroll more but I won't let me. So I eventually end up having to reset my phone just to make it work. Please fix that.,
I have all my friends on it and I love it a lot but.. Whenever I get one a call my friends say they can't see my camera and lots of other people to. It is really annoying. Besides this it's a good app. Please fix this. And also sometimes it will randomly hang up...... But anyways please fixxxxx!!!,
The app is good. Just sometimes itll say unable to send message. Which becomes really annoying. And you have to uninstall then install again. Amazing app just needs some bugs fixed. Also sometimes you cant upload a image as your profile.,
"This app has been amazing for the past year or two, but in the last month I haven't been able to log in. I put in email and password, and immediately it says 'Logging out' then sends me right back to the login page again. Messenger kids is the only way I can contact some of my friends and I haven't been able to. Please try to fix this.",
"I love it and you can message your friends with it really easily. Since it's for kids there are some emojis you can't use that I like to use, there is a mode we can make it so you can't send links. I'm pretty sure there's a mode for that. It's amazing except for the emoji part.",
"Now nothing works, can't sign in, keeps giving errors, updated, still didn't work. Deleted and reinstalled, still will not work. I've sent you messages, reported the issue over a month ago and still nothing. If they had negative stars you'd get that but they don't. FIX THIS ISSUE",
"It's great!! But there is one thing that always bothers me, on apple phone's it looks not like the actual messenger. She does not like that there is big squares for the other people's profile pics, she feels that here friends make fun of her for it looking like ""kids"". But the apple phone has an update for it to look more like messenger. And I'm not switching to apple.",
"I love this app for a free and safe video chat amd texting, but their is a few thing i would enjoy to be more upgraded for example the colors that there is listed for decorating your app i would like more colors listed and on a tablet their are only a few neon ones but on a iphone theres soft pastely colors and more choice's. Second, the filiters theres some good ones but more ones were you search up filiters you want kinda like how instagram does but not copying them just ideas,I would enjoy!",
Log in issues. Unable to log back into account. It just loops back after putting in information. Great app my son uses it to keep contact with his friends and family. But have been unable to access it again.,
"Severe difficulty authenticating devices. I just downloaded this app (09/25/22) and I'm unable to authenticate ANY of our devices. I put in my Facebook password, the app will accept the password and immediately log me out bringing me right back to the authentication screen. My daughter was looking forward to using this so please fix this issue. It's not my particular device as I've tried multiple in our house with the same result. I know it's not our Wi-Fi because it's happening using 4G as well",
everything works fine accept lately whenever I trie to open the app it kicks me out. it also disappeared once but still said I had it installed. I tried restarting my tablet and re-installing the app but i didn't work. if there's anyway you can fix this please tell me. thank you,
I love how as a parent I see who she's talking to and I decline or accept friend requests EVEN if she's sent out the request. I see it all. I really love how she can talk to her friends that had to move away for whatever reason. Great for all kids AND parents. Parents seriously it's a great app. My daughter is 9 and it's perfect for her and she CAN NOT get to anything else from this app...like Facebook. She can only be on the kids messenger NOT the messenger we use from Facebook.,
"good app I use it almost everyday but every time I log in it says ""session expired pleease log in again!"" and then I have to enter a phone number and a facebook password then have to disconnect my account then re-connect it. this is REALLYYY annoying! overall good app maybe make it offline though if possible thank you!",
"The fact that there are no responses on what's going wrong with this app really speaks volumes. You can at least send a statement stating the issue with the updated version. It's not hard to put a few words with a time expectation or ""N/A""",
"Horrible. I can't get past the login screen as when I login, it immediately logs me out, I have done everything I know to fix this. Nothing works, your app is horrible. Never have had a more annoying time to set up something for my little brother. I might as well download an APK of the previous version.",
"This app is fun, it has fun filters. But I have friends and they have updates I dont have. I even go on the app store to upgrade it but it doesn't work. These updates seem very fun. Like I was late to getting the pet game, and now theres a fun new like folder or something for a bunch of new games, however hard I try I cant get it. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!",
I would give this a zero but to write a review I have to give it a one. To start I have always had problems with messanger but I thought it was just me so I left it alone. Now I have had to create a separate Facebook account just to try to log into this frustrating app but to no avail it starts off by saying logging out but now it is saying that this user isn't allowed to sign in. This needs to get fixed immediately and I have been dealing with this since last week. Fix your app.,
"I enjoy messenger kids for my daughter. It let's her feel independent in communicating with her friends on her tablet, but gives me the peace of mind in knowing that whoever she's communicating with are people I have approved. My daughter has fun for sometimes hours chatting, texting, and playing games with her friends. I would have given it 5 stars, but when my daughter changed her profile picture I had a hard time changing it from the parent profile.",
"It's a good app to keep in touch with friends and family, but I don't get notifications (no chat head) and it would be great to be able to send and receive gifs as well as playing messenger games. Would love to see an update with these changes!",
"This was an amazing app. Well, WAS. I can see many people having this problem as well-- I cannot log in, whenever I try it just says ""logging out.."" and puts me in an endless loop. I love this app and would rate it five stars, but until this problem is fixed it will be one star. Please fix this",
"Great app! Only problem is when I do the videos where u can like edit that has like everything , it won't let me send it. Also, when I try to make groups, it just is white and NOTHING comes up. If it's a bug pls fix!! Great app otherwise! üê±",
"It's annoying because it can glitch on calls and my updates don't work. It's good to chat though. Also on some wifi, it doesn't send my messages and just says sending for hours until I go to another house and use the wifi, then it loads. It is very annoying!",
"This is a pretty good app. I normally use snapchat but my friends have strict parents and made me download this to be able to talk to them, honestly don't regret it. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it could've had a camera button to turn on and turn off your camera, I would've loved that, since now if I look bad or didn't do my hair that day I still have to show myself looking like a mess. BUT overall its pretty good! Please add a camera button, and I will give it 5 stars.",
I like this app for my 8 year old daughter and I love how i have full control over her profile. The only issue is trying to connect with kids that I am not sure of who the parents are. The little girl messaged my daughter to be frens but because i was not frens with that girls parents I couldn't. I'm guessing that is the problem. Couldn't find her. Not sure if that was my bad or them. Besides that I really enjoyed the app.,
The audio often doesn't work on video chat other than that my child likes it. My biggest issue with it is I can't do ANYTHING to adjust his friends and settings from my phone. Nothing. I don't HAVE a computer so now I need to use a friend computer. Very poor design.,
"So I am a kid using this app. It is great for younger kids, you can call and text easy, and parents can see what you are texting, also who you text the most. There are a few issues I would like to talk about. 1: Sometimes it doesn't let me use the filters, or play the games. 2: needs some more color options, maybe even a color wheel.3:there should be a filter parents can put on to stop there kid from saying certain words. 4: option to share the screen would work so ppl don't have to screen rec!",
"Just like everyone else is posting. Stuck in the endless login loop. People have been using sideloading to load old versions of the app to get it to work. If the development team is reading this, maybe revert the version in the play store so people don't have to do this.",
"My kids have been using the app through my phone with no problems for the last year. They're bigger now and recently got new tablets. I decided to put the app on their own tablets so I can remove it from my phone. The stupid log in keeps sending me in circles. I've changed my password, nothing works. I'd get rid of it but they use it to contact their cousins who don't live close. Please fix this issue.",
"Messenger Kids was great until the games stopped working. Our grandchildren use to call us so they could play games. All of a sudden , they are able to play their side of the game, but when it is our turn the graphics comes up , but our controls are inactive and will not react to our constant pressing of buttons. Messenger Kids gives no instructions or ways to correct the problem. We have deleted Messenger Kids and re-installed it without any correction to the problem.",
"The app was great until it stopped working on both of my kids Kindle Fire tablets. Even did a factory reset on one before I found out it was messed up on both. Everything but the camera works, permissions are there, and the camera works in every other app. Hopefully jts resolved soon.",
"Hi! Amazing app!! But, The problem is, Sometimes it doesn't let me type it says- 'unable to send' It is really annoying when im in the middle of a conversation with my Friends. Please fix this error or bug. Thank you.",
My daughter has been using the app for a year now and loves it. But a week ago the app kicked her out and we are not able to log her back in. It asks to verify device and when I do it says logging out and takes me back to the log in screen askimh for email and password info over and over again. Please fix this. It is a great app when it works. With the pandemic this is her source of communication with family and friends.,
"Same thing is happening to me that Ryan Murray mentioned. Keeps on asking for adult account verification, but when I type in my email & password and click authorize, it just keeps kicking me back in a constant loop. I've had messenger kids a while, it's been a good, well-used app for my kids. This is the first time we've had this problem. I'd give a higher rate due to my previous good experience, but until it is fixed, it gets a lower rating. Please fix soon so my kids can see their messages.",
"I have tried loading this on multiple devices and no matter what I do, it won't let me authorize any of the devices so I can't even get the app to run and trying to find help for the app has been incredibly frustrating. Don't bother with this one.",
"Same issue as most people have mentioned. I cannot log it as it keeps asking me to enter my details after I already have. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times, restarted the device, used different devices, cleared the cache, deleted old kids account and created a new one...and no response from help centre. Very disappointing.",
"I hardly write reviews but I love this app. It's super fun for all my kids and it feels safe. The ONLY thing I would wish for is the ability to accept/reject friend requests without having to download the regular Facebook app. I don't like having it on my phone so Im having to install and delete it every time my kiddos get a request or a new friend that joins. Otherwise, it's a great app. I like it better than regular messenger but that's because I'm a kid at heart. :)",
"Trying to move to a new device, and even after authorizing with a new device, the authorize new device screen keeps on popping up. It seems something is making it log out right after it logs in. There is no solution. Update: after reinstalling a few times it seems to work for some reason.",
"Edit: The app is now installing and working fine as at 5 October 2022. Thanks for the fix. I leave the 5 star review until we've used every feature. So far, everything is great. I'd love to give a thorough review. Unfortunately the app will not let us login. The app loops back to the front screen after we enter a password. We've tried the app on 5 different Android devices.",
"This app is actually really amazing! My child told me about this app and it looked so interesting and fun! and i was right! because i love how you guys put free stickers, filters and everything is age appropriate! my also favourite part is that you don't have to pay for a single thing! the only thing i dont like and that i didn't give you a star for is that you can have two of your childs sign up in the same Facebook account! like i tried with my two children and it didn't work!!",
"Will not let me log in, keeps asking for verification process info and is driving me crazy. It's on all of our devices, but I was trying to add my daughter's account on my phone so I can monitor what she does and who she talks to. I've tried uninstalling, restarting phone then reinstalling and still doesn't work.",
My daughter loves this app to connect with friends and family especially during the pandemic. I just wish there was a separate connected parent app with the option to check her messages so I dont get all the conversations on my phone as well.,
"It is very good for little kids. It's pretty simple, press them to text, press the camera to call. You can also change your friends profile pictures and it will only change for you, which means you could make it whatever you want. There are also no adds which is why a gave it 5 stars.",
Same issue with the recent reviews. It's not allowing me to login to any devices. It keeps on asking for authorization but to no avail. It seems that this is a common issue but FB is not doing anything to resolve this. Really frustrating!,
"You can call while you text it is amazing !!! You should give it a 5 stars . I never got to see my friend and now I can text her and call her !!! You should try watching a movie and talking to your friends and family !!! Also because of Covid 19 this would be helpful it is for me so it will for you !!! Please try it and the call is facetime!!! I absolutely LOVE this app !!! Also you can make music videos , Regular videos , and pictures you can play games like would you rather . I love this app !! You can also make music videos with fast motion !!! So go on google play now and install this app becuase you are missing out !!!",
"This app was great, until it started logging out when my child clicked on their account. I uninstalled and re-installed the app and now it keeps looping back to the sign in no matter what I try. Hoping for a fix for this problem.",
"I like the app for the most part, I just don't like that I get notified a day or more later that someone had messaged or called. I use this for my youngest to talk to his big brother and for me also to keep in contact and it's very depressing when I see a notification that my son had sent me a message 2days before. I'm sure it hurts his feelings as well. please do something about this, I've checked all the settings on my phone and the app and they're all turned on to notify me.",
"This is a great app. Easy to use, no phone numbers required. It's also easy for the parent to asks the childrens account. Your kids can create group chats, use fun filters, play fun games, and more. The parent will be notified if their child is using inappropriate words or launague. And your child can turn notifications on or off for certain people or groups.",
"This app is an amazing experience for my child although she says she has one little issue her friends and her want to change there group chat profile picture like you can to your account, but they aren't able to and they said that is it a bit disappointing that they cant make a picture to symbolize there group chat that they text in daily. My one piece of advice is to add that feature I'm sure my child and a lot more with be super satisfied with that update.",
"App runs fine, but there are serious problems with it. 1. There needs to be a way that parents can prevent children from making group chats. It's highly annoying and it can be bothersome to older grandparents who find themselves in multiple group chats and don't understand why or aren't acquainted with everyone in them. 2. Kids can send you GIFs, however you cannot send GIFs back. There should be an option to send select children's GIFs to child users.",
"We put this app on my 3YO tablet. It is very easy to him to use, and he is able to call his family members that aren't in state (his grandparents, aunts and uncles). My only complaint is because he is 3, he wants to call the people he loves so many times and doesn't yet get phone etiquette. I wish there was a function where I could have the ability to stop him from calling certain people at certain times (when they are at work) so they don't get bombarded. Or they had a function to have their name disappear from his contacts at certain times of the day if they choose. Other than that, we've really enjoyed it.",
The parental confirmation will not allow my child to access the app on their device. We have never had this issue before but she deleted the app because it was freezing and tried to reinstall and how we can't access it at all. Very frustrating and disappointing.,
I use this as another form of communication with my daughter. Add dates to when the messages are sent and it would be nice to be notified of messages received without having to check all the time. Notifications are on in settings but the app never sends a notification. So much talent at Facebook but you put out garbage.,
"I received invites from my ex to add my kids and everytime I try it keeps looping at the ""What would you like to do"" page. Tried on multiple devices, uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared cache and data, and same problem. Facebook support is useless because there's no way to contact them for help.",
"Will not allow me to authorise my phone. Was working fine and then went into the app to approve my child's new friends request and told me I had to log in. I have tried over 30 times to log in and it just keeps going back to the same screen. I have restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, used the 1 time only passwords and nothing is working. My child can't use the app now because it won't let me authorise my phone and she doesn't have her own phone or tablet.",
"I like messenger kids and I use it almost every day, but it makes me kind of annoyed that my friend on a iPhone gets more customization options then I do. Please add dark mode and all the different color themes for Android, and my friends on apple devices got a video off button a year before I did. I don't get why Android gets features so much later than Apple users. Also, when I go out of app on messenger kids on call, my friends can't hear me! Please fix this!",
"Messenger Kids is a great way for parents and kids to communicate with each other through Messenger. The app is sucure, doesn't give your login info to your kids and doesn't let strangers talk to them either. This app is great for phone and tablet users alike! However, the video chat quality is lacking at best and on one end is VERY quiet, and the other is normal. I wouldn't recommend calling all that often.",
The app is really nice. But there is one thing that I REALLY hate. It's the fact that you can't remove messages. I wish that the parents could at least remove messages that you send. And I say this because I have (quite a few times) accidentally sent a message to someone that I didn't want to send it to. One time it was really embarrassing. I also wish that there was an option for dark mode. If they fixed these things then I would definatly give it 5 stars. But all in all a good app.,
"Added a new profile for my son through the parent app but when I went to add his profile on his device, it will not let me log in. I put in my username and password and all it does it being me right back to the login page. Now my daughters can't even use their profiles because I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app on their device in hopes that would help but it didn't so now none of my kids can use the app. I need to be able to login. Please correct this!",
"I have had Messenger for many years, but over the past few years I barely use it. There are a few reasons. #1 I don't get any notifications, which leads me to forget about the app. Also when I open it up there are a lot of messages, so it is not the fact that no one is sending me anything. #2 the app is very slow and has a lot of glitches. #3 most of the games don't work, and if they do, they're very slow. The app used to be better when it has less things added. Maybe it just needs less.",
"Got new devices for kids and we cannot log them in. Tried installing again, clearing cache, everything. It asks for parent to authorize, which we do, then loops back to log in again. Password is correct. Happens on all devices. No parent supervision software installed either. It is a clean, new device.",
"1. The messages that are sent to me never notify me. 2. There is only a video chat option, no regular calling. 3. It never notifies me about my ""pet,"" so it always dies. 4. It always lags in the ""games"". 5. It feels as if my effects in the video chats deplete. 6. Some of the""games,"" feel unfinished and seem as if they could be better.",
"Its good, but sometimes the call logs me out. For example, I was calling my cousin. I called her on my phone, then my phone died. I called her on my tablet, and every 2 mins, the call would shut down. I was playing 3008 in Roblox with her, and all of a sudden the call muted, and the screen went blank. Same thing happened with my other friends. This needs a serious fix. Other than that, it's a great app to let kids chat with one another and play games. Please fix the call problems.",
"Great app but I have a few suggestions. First, maybe there could be more of a color wheel instead if just the 12 colors you can pick, and second, my sister has the ""try this"" video thing but I don't. I don't know if this is a glitch or something, but I would like to have that feature as well. Also my friends got the new update because they have iphones but I have a Samsung and don't have the update",
"I LOVE the Messenger Kids app#! During the Coronavirus quarantine we we're able to talk to our granddaughter every day. She has been so bored, being an only child with no contact with her friends from school. We visit sometimes multiple times daily, playing the built in games and silly filters. Thanks for making it a fun app that's even easy for grandparents to use!",
"It's a great way for kids to communicate, but sometimes my kid would come up to me and say, ""mom I logged myself out can you log me back in?"" I don't even know how she does it, but my point is that it's sort of tricky to log her back in. What I really like about this app is that kids can communicate at any time, and there is lighthearted games for them to play. Nobody can contact them except for the people I put as their ""friends"". overall great app. Kids can do lots on it, but nothing bad.",
Worked well until it just didn't. I would put in my FB password and it would say invalid. I can't get into my kids accounts. Uninstalled and will try again. Update: Uninstalling and reinstalling does not work! Another update: I guess it is fixed but only time will tell.,
"Same login issues. My son got logged out and now it just takes me through the login loop. Enter my credentials and after loading for a few seconds, it flashes on the screen ""Logging Out"" and takes me back to the login screen. Updated, uninstalle/reinstall, cleared data and cache, tried on another device. No luck. My review will be deleted once it is fixed as otherwise my kids love it. Only way it seems to maybe get Facebook attention???",
"doesn't handle URLs well... I want to share selected videos with the kids, and it gives me 8 alerts every time a URL is sent to the group with my nieces and nephews. It also doesn't let the kids do a regular voice phone call, which is the ONLY way that they should be able to do it, because video calling people is rude. thats why it isn't 5 stars ... the kids can create their own adult account and this has to be good enough to keep them from doing that.",
Ongoing issues when switching between kids' accounts. Constantly being logged out or locked out. Even if passwords are updated and app reinstalled. App would be great if it worked longer than a week after installing.,
We've had messenger kids for years but trying to add it to my daughter's new phone and it won't let me enter my password. Just stuck in the same loop as the other reviews. Sent messages for help with no luck. The bad thing is every time I try to get it to work it makes messenger act up and I have to Uninstall the app to get it to work again. I hope they get this glitch fixed soon.,
"Great app. It is easy to use. My children used it daily without any issues. However, we recently did an install on new devices, and it sends me through a constant login loop. I tried reinstalling, and the same thing happens.",
"I like to text my friends. But, you are making it where its UNABLE TO SEND. I HAVE WIFI. SO WHY IS IT NOT ABLE TO SEND? IM NOT EVEN ABLE TO COMFORT MY FRIENDS BECAUSE OF YOU. Edit: What if I was kidnapped, but had wifi (for some reason), so I tried to text my friends for help but then, it doesn't allow me to text. So now, I have to be in someone's basement for until I die. But gladly that's not a situation I'm dealing with. But if I did, I'd hate this app. (For life)",
it wont send the messages and it deleted it self and i had to reinstall it and it blocked people i did not want blocked,
This app is great! I can chat with all my friends and video call them. There are so many filters in this app and they are so cute. We can chose any picture to be on our profile picture. Download this app if you want to chat and video call your friends. This app is the for kids. Thank you so much for bringing this app and please make more apps like this.,
Hi This app won't let me log in. I used to use this app for multiple things but it no longer allows me to log in. This is very annoying and other people seem to have the same problem. The app just takes you back to the login despite having the correct info. I will rewrite this review and change the rating if this is fixed. I appreciate it.,
"Update: It took about 2 weeks, but the app is finally working again. Changing my rating from 1-star. FIX THE APP!! I have two kids on Messenger Kids. One account is still working just fine... for now. The other I'm stuck in a propetual loop of ""authorizing device"". It's happening on multiple devices. We've uninstalled/installed the app, cleared cache, deleted account and set up another.. nothing is working. We've reported the issue twice to Meta.. no reply.",
"I love this app! I am able to talk to my friends even if they are really far away! The only thing I don't like is that when you send a request to add a nother person to your parent, they have to find them on Facebook and find them (wich I'd bad if they don't know who there parent is) instead of just saying yes or no. But overall I recommend this app for kids!",
I like this app I got it because the kids at my school have this app with this app you can call and text I give it 5 stars also no adds.,
"this app is a good way to talk to friends and family, I gave it a 4 star because I'm having a problem with texting. For some reason if I want to write something in text I type 1 letter and it stops typing and then I have to tap the word box so I can keep typing. Please do something about it, it bothers me a lot. And the camera is so glichy, and that is also a problem im having. Thank you.",
This is so fun to have! It is easy to access and it makes it even more fun to chat and call my friends! I love the moving emojis and filters that you can send to your friends. It makes me feel more protected that my account is being monitored my my trusted guardian. My only critique is that you can't share your screen during your face time chats. I don't ever want this app to leave!,
"I really like this app! Let's me talk to my friends when I can not see them, But on my iPad I can not get it to update may just be the device I'm using but this is a 5 star app in my opinion but if you are a cranky mean guy I would never download this app you can talk to your friends from Long distances (if you even have any you probably don't) Otherwise this is a great app for all those mean cranky folks out there like you all the time. I hope all you dumb people with no friends like this app.",
"It was a good app. It allows my kids to keep in contact with their friends, cousins and other family, and i have control of who they add. My son has a new drvice and the only sign in options are ""create a new account"", where it always gives me a generic error message, or download actual messager on his device - he is 6. Why is there no option to just ""log in"" with kids messenger?",
"I think it is an amazing app for kids to text friends and family. I am 10 and I love texting my grandparents, my cousins, and my friends. You can facetime people.It is kind of like snapchat where you make those faces. This app is very good for younger kids like me. Kids my age shouldn't have there own facebook page and stuff like that. Messenger kids is great!üëçüëçüëç",
This app is okay it's a really good app to have to video call your friends no matter what device they're on Android iOS tablet PC laptop computer but the thing is occasionally the pupils of photos will disappear and sometimes it won't send and it's kind of getting annoying and the emoji thing it really is getting annoying I would like it fixed thank you I would recommend this app but as of right now it's a 3.9,
I really like the game but if it's for kids you should take away the middle fingers. Also I also don't like how cheap the art supplies for it are. So please add more colors or let us make our own color and save it. But I'm able to text my mom and friends and the stickers are really cute lol. I wish we could make our profile pics from our photos or gallery instead of having to take a pic.Do I need to update it or something to do it? Please tell me.,
"It wont even let me create an account for my kid to use.. it just keeps saying something went wrong when trying to create the account and everytime i try again, it still says the samething. I even uninstalled and installed it again several times and it still says the same thing every single time. I made one for her awhile ago and it was fine but now i don't understand.",
"This app has given me so many problems throughout the history of me using it. This morning I log on and half of my friends are gone on my friends list, the only people I have is the person who controls my account, and my other friends. I eventully found out that Messenger Kids just unfriended the person and removed them so now I have to go through this annoying process until that person gets on my friend list again. This app sucks.",
"I would love this app but we are having trouble making a account. We put our info on it and we tried to put kids date of birth and first name and last name but it won't let us go on the app, it says it has a error,we even tried parents date of birth but it takes us to messenger but not kids messenger and it only does that for the adults let me know if I am just not doing it right or something. btw this could be handy for being on vacation and not seeing friends for a little üíêüéä!",
"Hello so I have had this app for over 2 years and Not once have I uninstalled it there are so many games that you can play missions to accomplish and people you can call! Make your profile picture something from your gallery. Or take a photo now and make it your profile! Yes I am a YouTuber and if you want to be in one of my videos I dare you to, install the game and give it a five-star! No bugs there is 100% this is the perfect way to reunite with your friends and family! Thank you",
Hi guys I am just 9 years old and I go to school in my van in my van there is a girl she said me to download this because my mom has a personal information so she doesn't allow me to chat with my friends I downloaded this but why it's saying for Facebook id my mom has personal information she can't give me her id what does it mean I am saying you that don't ever think to download this pls I said no It's so glitchy no notification what does it means uhhh bye pls don't download this,
"I am having the same problem as other users. When I try to login it is just circling back around to the login, after telling me it is logging out! When I use the onetime password the same thing happens. I am still getting login alerts. Tried changing passwords ( I was concerned it may be related to the recent Optus hack ), installing and re installing. Nothing works. Help!",
Sleep mode isn't working. For the past couple weeks I have been trying to set the sleep time and it just won't work. Let's say it's 8:AM. I have sleep mode set from 6:30am-8pm Sun-Thur my child is still able call people. This is especially annoying when my 4 year old tries call people repeatedly. This really needs to be fixed.,
"My calls won't go through they will hang up straight away and my mic always echos. And when I call my best friend it goes straight to ""this user cant answer"" or something like that and my camera when it's on I can't tap my screen for a filter and when I'm on call for an hour or so my call makes this weird beeping noise and everything goes silent. And when I play games on call my screen flashes black if I touch the sides of my phone. Please this these errors fixed they bug me so much.",
This is an amazing app but sometimes it doesn't give me the notification when my mom text me and it works for other people,
Doesn't even let me log in anymore i loved this app to talk to my child while she wasn't at home now i have nothting,
"I have 2 kids. One has had an account on here for over a year, yet for the verbal months I've tried creating another account for my 2nd child. It let's me go through the process of adding their info, then when I accept the terms and privacy policy it tells me there was a problem and to please try again later. I've tried again many times over the last several months with no additional info as to what the problem is or what I can do to fix it. Please fix this, I sent an email as well.",
"I LOVE this app. It is a great way for my self to contact friends and family. The only requests I have are 1. Please bring back the old filters. They were so much better then the ones now. And 2. Please add more colors to the place where you choose the color of your app.One last thing.there is a feture on messenger where you can rename your contacts,please add that to messenger kids as well.",
"I love this app it is amazing ,it is totally kid friendly ,I would definitely prefer it.it is free and since we can't get together as much as we used to, kids messenger helps that kids stay in touch with their friends . The parent can see whatever they send and who they are talking to.,This does not mean that the kids will have there own Facebook page. It Is my favorite app ever ,if you are seeing this then download kids messenger it is amazing!!!!!!!!!!Now I will be able to call and text my bf",
"Right now im really disappointed... why? Because I spent 8 or more hours making a music video JUST AND ONLY for my bff and it was only 1 or less minutes long and guess what? IT WOULDN'T SEND AT ALLLLLL! ü•∫ I have sent 1 minute videos before and they worked, why not my music video? üò≠ü•∫ this is the only app I could chat on, if it wasn't I would delete it ü•∫ü•∫",
Amazing. Its good so parents can accept or decline when there kids want friends. So children can just have creeps on there account. The thing i dont really like about it. U cant just call somone it always have to be facetime. I can just turn ur camra of/mute but it gets annoying. Oh and when u take photos its very limited theres not alot of filters. But anyway i hope this was helpful,
"Update:: They fixed the loop, however when I go to add a parent, it keeps telling me something went wrong and to try again later. It will not allow me to add their dad. Downloaded this app and can't get it to authorize my device. I put in my Facebook password and it just keeps looping back around and asking me to authorize it over and over. Please fix this so my kids can enjoy this app.",
"Great way to keep track of who your young kids communicate with. However, every call, text of interaction causes a notification on the parents phone as well. If this happens while you're at work it can be annoying.",
The app itself is great and I like the weekly reports. Where I had a hard time is trying to add my mother who is not a friend on Facebook but I want to let her be able to interact with her granddaughter. So it literally took several weeks to get them connected. The process is secure but unnecessarily complicated for older non tech savy people. I couldn't help my mother because we don't live in the same country.,
"Going into their app was hard enough that I may have given it a one. You have to get permission from a parent but my parents didn't know their password. It took two hours to get everything settled. I still cannot make video calls because it says I have no WiFi. It says I have no WiFi in a lot of areas in this app, that I can't count them anymore. The only reason I give it a two is because I am not experienced in this app and may have to wait to give a one because I do not know the full app. 2/5",
"This app is so cool!I can talk to so many people,and the adorable features are amazing when you video chat(it's like snapchat) and it really helps me because I'm in a different country away from my family but I can talk to them!‚ù§Ô∏èand you can see if someone's typing,and if your not on the app then you still get other people's messages!I HIGHLY recommend this app!it's the best!üíóüíñ",
"I like that I can monitor my daughter's activities and she doesn't have to tie up my device when using the app. However, I have noticed that when her friends call, my phone receives notifications of an incoming call but not my girl's chromebook. So, that means I have to then tell her to open kids messenger and call them back. Yet she does get notifications first, if they text her.",
"I cannot access the app. It stopped allowing me to open my daughter's account and keeps requesting that I authorize my device. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, had codes sent via email and text, cleared caches - everything. It will not load and I keep getting the device authorization screen. The entire point of having Messenger Kids is the ability to review their activity and it is currently useless as a parent.",
I've been logged into messanger kids and I've never had to log out. It was working fine but I deleted for something and now when I try to log back in it doesn't let me at all. I type in my Facebook account then the password and then it makes me do it again and again and it never stops. It never takes me to the next page it automatically starts me over.,
"This app is pretty good, although there are a lot of things I dislike. For example, most of the games I try to access don't work, and when they do, I can't send it to my friends, there's just a transparent like screen with the color I use for my texts. I also am using a tablet to use this, and I feel like I'm not getting as many privileges as phone users do. I also use an android and again, feel like I'm not getting as many privileges as the Apple users do. Please fix these mistakes, thank you.",
"SUPER SIMPLE and FUN for my 10-year-old daughter to use... I just love this app because I can't afford a cell line for her but she can still CALL, video chat, and message with Wi-Fi. Excellent for her to keep in touch with friends over the summer, and she can call or message me in case of emergency. Especially appreciate the control I as a parent have over it, gives a mom a certain amount of safety and security in this not-so-safe online world.",
"I'm a kid so bear with me- This is a great way to stay in touch with friends and family. My problem is simple but annoying. I can't hear notifications even when both app notifications and system notifications are on. Its creepy how parents can spy on you without you knowing. Personally, it's a crappy app that's spyware. I can't even gets texts from my mom with me knowing!!! HATE IT!!!",
"This is great for kids to stay in touch. However, the app takes control of your phone when a message or call comes in. If you are in the middle of doing work on your phone the app interrupts your texting, conferencing, replying to someone else text.",
Well it's not bad at all but it is weird how when your in a call sometimes you can't see face someones face it's like hey look at this but you can't see them. On some devices you can't hear videos. Overall it's a good app:),
App used to work great. It was a great way for my daughter to communicate with her dad in Europe. But now they can't send anything messenger kids. Tried reporting the problem to Facebook and have gotten absolutely no response. Its very frustrating cause this was the only way my daughter could communicate with her dad. Now I have to find a different app for them. My daughter shouldn't have to text between so many different apps.,
"It's a fun way to stay in touch with my nieces. But the ""grow your pet"" feature isn't letting me change outfits and it is having issues responding to my taps/swipes. This wasn't a problem until a few days ago. Please fix.",
I love this app! It is perfect for my children to talk safely with close family and friends! I can look at their messages and they can never be erased. They can't talk to no one without my consent and that helps put me at ease. I highly recommended this app for safe chatting for your kids! :),
"Used to be great until update a few months ago. My children were logged out of the account and we cannot sign back in or create a new account for them. We have cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled, reported the issue - and nothing has worked. It's been 4 months or more and the issue is yet to be resolved.",
"I like this app, but there are a lot of bugs. Some of the photo filters don't even work, and the games are slow. I also don't like that you can't choose a picture from your gallery for your profile photo. I if these issues are fixed, I would give the app 5 stars.",
"Maybe you could add some more actions towards this app. My little cousin that is only 5 years old, he uses this app but he has trouble reading the words. I supervise him and monitor him a lot so he could learn the words that I am saying and the app is saving. Plus additionally, I think you should add the reading tool or a voice that can help my cousin understand a bit more. Since he is a non-english speaker and It's hard for him to understand for some words. So please!!! Add my suggestion here!!",
This app has great parental control. but the voice note lags when my chils sends me msg and i can never fix it. tried to uninstall and re install but it still does the same thing. is only the voice note lag problem can be fixed it would be great.,
"It's decent. It cencors unnecessary words, and if you send a link to someone, it makes you answer a question, and you or your parents can't disable that feature. It does a lot of unnecessary things that are just annoying, and you can't change your user once your done. It still gets the job done, so not too bad.",
"Its good. The problem is when the kids starting to send photos, especially those private/screenshots photos and documents. Usually, the phone they are using is from the parents. If there is a lock mode for using photos/documents to send, the better.",
I like the app for my daughter so she can talk with her friends that don't have Google Hangouts BUT I'm very upset that her bluetooth headphones will NOT stay connected during video calls. I don't need to hear the conversations that go on between them. Please add this option!,
PC app does not let add contacts or download previous contacts when sighing in from a tablet. Will not communicate to even my messenger while trying to get this to work for my daughter. It is a great way for her to stay in touch with friends and family. Works great of tablets but does not work on PC's. Very disappointed.,
"I love this app!!! i can text my friends or call them whenever i want, and i like that u can copy and paste your message or your friends message! and its also nice that you can get a number to give to your friends so they can add you!! overall i think this app is great!!!! but... im on a chromebook right know downloading it and all it says is installed, and when i go to the messenge kids website it still wants me to download it!!! and i have google play and everything!!!",
Fix these things PLEASEEEE. 1) You can't use Gallery to change your profile pic. 2) Change the Emojis and stickers to look cooler and more like a normal messenger. 3) Make it where you can do normal calls and not just video chat. 4) Please put a voice- to- Text add-on to the app. 5) You can't send links.6)Video calling is very glitchy but it could just be my phone I don't know. If you could fix these things I'd give 5 star. Thank youuu,
This app really needs to be able to make audio calls in the android app. My child's only option is the video chat. I would prefer he isn't always on camera. And on a technical side it eats through the battery charge relatively quickly.,
"Honestly, this app sucks I sent my friends a picture of a grape and messenger kids marked that as bad and sent it to my parent, yet when my friend sends a innapropriete anime picture it doesn't even get deleted from past messages yet I still have to use such garbage to even talk to my friends I wouldn't recommend getting it find a better app that gets rid of actual bad things instead of a grape. Oh and yeah takes up to much space and I sometimes don't get notified!",
"So far this seems like a good, safe, and fun communication tool for my child. However, since she does not yet have her own phone, I really wish we had the option of downloading this app to her Kindle! She might not have video chat capabilities but could at least message others without having to use an adult's phone.",
"It is a nice app but the biggest problem is, when I try to text one of my friends, it says unable to send but when I text anyone else on this app, it is fine. And the calls glitch and your screen will flash if something gets covered and it is very annoying",
"I really love it it's so good ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüòç it's definitely kid friendly but I didn't like how you can only make the video 1 minute long or less. it also has fun games you can play with your friends also I would like for color themes to have black, white, and maybe gray? Also I would like of you could make just calls to bc I love calling my friend's but sometimes I just want to call not face time also I would like to be able to put the filters on pets it would be really cute. Bc I have a kitten üò∫.",
"Very stupid app! Will not let my child connect to other kids! Only adults! I do not understand the purpose. There is silly little games encouraging children to throw their trash like it's a basketball. Very inappropriate, my child did NOT enjoy this app. And quite frankly, neither did I! Also, side note, there should be more access to certain things. My kid should be able to connect to their friend on a certain time limit, and there would be no way of knowing what they're doing.",
"I love the app, but facetime stopped working. I can't call my friends because the facetime sound and video freezes and I can't her people and they can't hear me. The same things are happening with my friends. Please fix this problem soon.",
"It's good when trying to chat with friends & family, but you don't know when there's a message until you look because there's not notification sound. That would make it even better if it had a notification sound when they have a message. Please fix this.",
It's amazing there's just one thing.... So say you were looking at all the texts and all the people you talk to ya know just catching up well it will say such and such is online most of the time when they are online it saying they offline but when they offline sometimes it saying they online but they not! So ya but really amazing and great app I recommend it also idk if it's just me but my texts take a VERY VERY long time to send but not to all people just some so ya I hope this helps,
"Everytime I try to install this,.I get an ""error creating child account Try again later"" error. I've tried on multiple devices, devices with and without the adult versions. It stinks. I hope whatever is wrong gets resolved soon.",
"This app is really great for allowing younger children to be able to have their ""freedom"" while also keeping control over who they talk to as well as keeping them safe some bad things. It's also alot of fun to watch them use the effects and things while doing so. I also like the fact that you can do check ins to make sure everything is all good and safe. Just wish I knew how to pull up video chats.",
"Looks ok, and have not tried all of the features yet. One thing that is really bugging me is how hard it is to delete an account. My partner and I had a request from someone, we both clicked the link they sent and it made two seperate accounts for our daughter. I cannot, for the life of me, find how to delete the duplicate, I would have thought this would be an easy thing to find. 3 & 1/2 stars for this, simple app yet not too user friendly.",
I LOVE IT!!!!!! so I don't have it on this device but I have it on another one either way I love it there is NOTHING wrong with this app it's great I think u should download it it's easy too! I love it so much keep the work going!üòèüòèüòèüòè this includes . sending photos . texting .video calls .normal calls . chat groups .games .changeable profile picture .and a code to give to people u know,
It's a great and useful app and all but if I'm trying to send a music video to my mom it only lets me send it to people who have kids messenger and another thing I feel like we should be able to save videos that that people send to us because my mom sent me a video that was important and I can't save it and you should be able to change the ringtone because I'm sick of hearing the same thing over and over again those are the only things that seems to be wrong with it but it's still good.,
"I can talk to friends which is what it's for so nothing special. But this bug keeps happening where it says your ""message will not send"" and it is making it where I can't use the app for it's primary function; talking to my friends only thing stopping me from giving it 2 stars is the filters",
"This app is THE BESTTTTTT! You can text and call your friends! But it would be nice if we could make our profile photo something from our gallery easily or to just choose a photo from our gallery to make our profile photo that, but otherwise it's great! Totally recommended this",
"The call quality was TERRIBLE! Plus, there are no good face masks or filters, there are only a few, which is really disappointing. Not to mention, the grow your pet is laggy and glitchy. In order to make a group call or chat, everybody must be friends with each other, and most of the time, that does not work out. It's just an overall not a good app. Would not recommend getting it. üò§üò°üò†",
"everything is great, but, when i send message, sometimes it never even goes through. im on an Android, and when im on a call or taking a video with an interactive filter, i can never use it or click on it. other than that, its great.",
"Amazing for kids lots of fun games to play, aswel it would be helpful if you didn't have to grow your pet every day, then if you don't it acts like you did so, that's not the best but other than that it isn't slow, or glitchy at all! I would really, recommend.",
It's a great app.But what's not ok is how the messages are unable to send. great amount of games it's a great app idea. it's better then most messaging apps.i would like if you could fix the unable to send messages problem.i use the app all the time.And I was using the app and I couldn't text because it said unable to send.And she couldn't call so that made it harder.she was getting a little upset because she thought I was ignoring her.its needs to be fixed.i restarted the device. did not work.,
"I love connecting with my friends and family on the app and there are no ads! I wish you had the option to video chat or not and instead of made up words as a ""phone number"" I wish the app gave you numbers, but over all a great app to have and strongly suggest to parents who won't give their children/child a phone to contact people to download the app and suggest it to their friends",
"Otherwise than this, it works fine, but I cant text 2 people. A couple of years ago, I had 2 foreign exchange students, and wanted to keep in touch with them, but bus I can't because it said I couldn't chat or video call with them anymore, yet they are still my contacts. I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but it does to me. Please fix.",
"I was able to log in before, but like others now it puts me in a never ending loop to authorize the device. I did it 6 times, did a one time code a couple of times. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still telling me to authorize the device. This is super annoying",
"As a lot of others below, I am not able to get past entering password to authorise account. Keep going round in circles. Daughter has an account already, just need to put on new device. Very frustrating. Please fix ASAP. Besides this, the app is good, as I can control who my child communicates with.",
I dislike that you can't play anything with out a camera. You also don't get notifications if the app isn't open. Overall I was able to contact others so was not horrible it did what it said it could do. But things you should know that are inside the app that are not the most convenient.,
"This is the best safest app that you can probably get but the only downside is that one time I try to send a picture and it was drawings of people and it reported it to my parents, the other downside is that you can't send links, so if you wanted to send a link to a music video you can't, you have to send a screenshot",
"I like the idea of the app for kids to use for texting.My experience for it was good,but there's a few things I would change like seeing your texts while on a call. Overall, I like the app and I enjoy using it.",
"I like massager kids but, from a 13-year-old perspective, aka myself, I wish I could add friends myself bc my mom is always so slow to respond. I also wish that since my 13 I was given more freedom. Also, I don't like how my mom can use my account to call and text other ppl it's weird. But if your kid is five they will love this with all the games. I also wish it was easier for me to sign into my account on other devices and a previously used device.",
the video freezes. i downloaded it for 2 of my kids and when they call each other it shows up on my phone. that is annoying. i want to shut that off.i cant figure out how if its even an option. not many control options.,
"This app is not working on a Samsung Galaxy tab and it's no longer working on my kids Amazon Fire tablet. All it does is lock you into an endless login loop. Doesn't matter how many times you clear the data, reboot or change permissions.",
"This is not a great app, but it won't send any messages. If I try to send something, it will just say that it is ""sending"" and then an hour later, it is still sending. This is very annoying. People can send me stuff, but I cannot send them stuff. I also cannot see messages from over two months ago. Sometimes it doesn't even load my chats with others. Other times, I cannot see pictures or videos from other people. Notifications don't really show up all of the time, even though I enabled them.",
"I love this app, i can chat with my friends and we call every day. But there is a problem, they got this update a few weeks ago that when you send voice messages, you can change your voice. I really wanted to try it but i didn't get it. I tried to update the app but it didn't give me the option. I'm not sure if you guys can do something to help but it would be amazing.üòÅ",
Well it's a okay app ( 2 1/2 stars) . It does not support many other.. Gifs or vids. I've tried uploading Ar emojis but it would not budge. There is a lot of parenting controls which is amazing! Though if you don't have Facebook you can't use it. Definitely still like the old software but again the app is okay. (Needs WiFi to work) OH and you can barely heir anythaaaang.,
"I was told about this app for my daughter to use with her grandparents and thought it was an amazing idea but we are military stationed in a us territory and it wont let us use it because its ""not available in this region"". Is there some way around this? We depend more on virtual communication more than anything for her bonding with family.",
It suddenly stopped working and when I try to install it again I simply cant. It refuses to let me log in! It's so frustrated! Same loop that someone else described right below. I tried everything. It happened exactly the same thing asking me for my password over and over again. Its been hours trying.,
Not to sure. Lately anymore. I do not receive messages unless I open and refresh it a few times. I can get calls and it won't go threw. I've tried deleting and redownloading the app but still does the same thing.,
I LOVE this app!! This gives me a way to communicate with my friends easily!! The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because whenever I go to make a group with some friends it only lets you make groups with people that you have on messenger kids and I know this protects you so that you're not talking in a group of strangers but also sometimes whenever I have a lot of people have messenger kids but they don't have each other it is hard to make a group so please change this ASAP.,
"Tried to get this for my daughter. Can't do it on her laptop or the family chromebook. bought the cheapest tablet we could (because it's a bad time to spend money) only to find it won't work on that either, and we can't return it. This ended up being an expensive worthless waste of time and my daughter still can't connect independently with friends",
Been using this app for years wirh my kids. For last several weeks it hasn't worked and nothing being done to fix it. Won't let you log in or authorize a device. It logs you out immediately. Fix the problem its been way too long and too many people complaining wirh nothing being done. I would give a zero star if I could at this point.,
"It is very difficult and complicated to add adult contacts for my child even if I am already Facebook friends with them. I sent them an invitation, they accepted, but the app said I still need to approve it. Nearly half an hour later, I receive a request from the person I invited, and when I accept it, it says ""error occured"". Totally impossible and absurd!",
"My daughter used Messenger Kids for a couple of weeks, but the app has stopped working. She was logged out, and now when trying to log in, the app endlessly loops the log in screens that are supposed to authorize her device. I've tried to log her in on a Samsung Galaxy s8 and on an older Samsung Galaxy s5. Neither can log in successfully. If this issue is fixed, I will rate higher.",
"I love having this app available for my daughter to use, particularly because it requires my approval for her to add any contacts. What I don't love is that she doesn't receive any notification when she gets a message - I get them instead. What is the point of a messenger app that allows the child to send and receive messages, but does not notify them when they receive them from approved contacts?",
"This is a terrific app! I am able to monitor my child's interactions and approve his contact list as well. The perfect way to help your child learn to navigate on their own, a step towards the independence they crave.. with the parental control they still require.",
"(Please read all of this) I feel like Messenger Kids was Great! It was easy for my friends to get on it. But, on my Chromebook, (Which is really fast,) I kept freezing and glithcing on a videochat. Also, the idea of Parents seeing ALL of your messages is creepy. If you read this please note that Google Hangouts is a good choice too.",
I have been trying for over a month now to create an account for my son so he can contact his cousins and friends but I've only been getting account creation failure. I've also try to get a hold on the the help support but no answer. I would not recommend this ever its a waste of time and it doesn't work and if I could I would give this app a zero star.,
"I finally set up 3 of my kids on Messenger Kids. Why did I wait so long?! It has opened them up in a whole new way for interacting with their friends and peers, which is SO needed during the pandemic. I love that we have a family group. We don't have enough handheld devices for everyone to use at the same time - but with our computers, too, we can try it out and have fun with it. The kids and their friends have only 2 'complaints' so far: the spell check is wonky and the volume is quiet.",
"Technically, my mom didn't make my account, I did. I wanted to check out what you could do, I was real surprised afterwards. This app is a lot more family friendly, and more entertaining for children. I would recommend adults who like to meme around use this app as well, since it's more likely created for that. Would Recommend.",
Three stars cause You cant edit messages nor delete them (which is very stupid to do.) And it's way too childish. The drawings. Even the original one is better. Cause you can delete messages and photos. Another thing is. This app is way too childish. It looks like it was made for toddlers. And Its managed by parents Facebook account. What if the child that wants this app has parents that DOESNT have a facebook account. Waste of time. The minigames are boring. Limited colors.,
This is the best app to call and text you can do group calls but I love this app so much I am on it every day texting my friends u should get itüòÑüòä,
"This is a good app if you're a little kid but I'm 12 and I have super overprotective parents so it would be great if there was a version of this app for older kids maybe it could be in the settings for the app. Another thing is that you can't chat with people if them or their parent isn't Facebook friends with your parent, I can understand the thinking behind that but it's actually really annoying because I want to chat with my Aunty who uses messenger but doesn't use Facebook.",
It doesn't let me choose any themes just because I have a older phone it's not right,
This app is good for kids but just some problems. 1. We can't save videos. 2. Some filters gets deleted. 3. When we type :) or <3 it turns into emojis. 4. PRIVACY. I get that parents need to see what their children are doing/sending to people but I need privacy. I talk about personal stuff that I am not comfortable to share with. And there's more but I really really really don't like the idea of parents seeing our messages because that is already INVADING THE PRIVACY OF PEOPLE. Thank you.,
This app has been great but right now having the same issue as others. App just keeps asking me to log in and when I ever the information it goes back to the log in screen. I gave changed my Facebook password and have uninstalled the app. Nothing works. Will there be a fix to this soon?,
Logging into the app has become extremely difficult. Reading through the reviews we have encountered the same problem as all of the others. I add my password to authorize the device and it takes me directly back to the login screen. Very disappointing as my daughter can't communicate with her friends in their group chats any longer.,
"I downloaded this for my daughter when she was 10,that was 2 years ago, and we both love it, she can keep in contact with hwr friends in our old cities, and I love the fact that it alerts me to who, she adds, talks to, and who she blocks and ignores, it also allows me to make sure her conversations are kid friendly i just love that I can control and monitor what she does on it. She loves the games and is constantly swnding me drawings and guessing games, its a good safe chatting app for kids.",
"It does what it's supposed to do for the most part. That's why I'm giving it a three-star. The reason I'm not giving it a five-star is because it has so many bugs. My son doesn't get any notifications sometimes, I feel like there's more to do on the adults messenger for kids than the kids messenger. For some art reason my wireless Bluetooth never works during calls on Facebook Messenger",
Can you PLEASE make this compatible with more computers? My girls have a Chromebook and I'd really like them to be able to use them and not keep using my phone! I hate that my phone is the only option for this. My work laptop is also not compatible and it's a Lenovo. This has potential to be an amazing app if my kids can use it on anything themselves.,
"It is so fun I love it I get to talk to my friends every day all day, but I can't touch any of the games and I miss sending games like tic-tac-toe to my friends again‚òπ Their are a few errors I would like to be fixed and things added back. Besides all of that, I love the app and I think it is very safe for children.",
"I think it is a great app but my little sisters friend just wont stop calling and since she has to talk on my phone it kicks me off whatever I am doing which means I cant do anything. There really should be a button that says something like ""I cant talk right now"" and the other person cant call you until you press a button that says ""I am available."" It would be really helpful if that was added to the app",
"This app is AWSOME !!!!!! it is perfect for kids there is so many games and you can FaceTime it's just like messenger but for kids . The only thing you can't do is do just a regular call , Which that is not a problem for me but you can only chat , again I don't really care if you can only chat .Parents can see the kids text and if they block each other üòÉ .This is the best texting app for kids .",
"Please help! I have all the notification settings set right yet we aren't getting notifications of messages and sometimes we don't even get the phone calls! Also, can you please make this app transferable to the SD card?!?! It takes up a fair bit of room... otherwise I would give you a higher rating",
I love the app but i have a problem that happens everytime i call somone this hlitch happens whenever i touch the top of my screen/camera it glitches and jus turns black. I know its not somthing wrong with my phone since it has happened to many others i have called and it only happens in this particular app. I love the app and all. But i just need this super annoying glitch fixed. -Annoyed reviwer/user,
I LITERALLY LOVE THIS APP! I can chat w/my family and friends! Thank u very very much Meta platforms inc for making this amazing app!! Suggestions: Mabye u guys can make Instagram kids and Facebook kids? If u do thank u meta!,
"Idk if it's just my tablet But the funny face filters dont work! And, any time a storm happens the WiFi is still bad a day after it happens. The messages take forever to send. But, i do like that parents can decide if you can accept friend requests. Another thing I don't like is that when you type emojis but with that symbols on your oeyboard it automatically changes to the emoji. I just want to symbol version, because it's cuter so please s change that.",
"I'm having the same issue that other people have reported. It puts me in a constant login loop. It was fine on one device until my kids tried to switch to a different user, and then it started there too. So frustrated!",
"This app is very glitchy, for instance it is really slow and my screen goes black when I call someone. I also can't do the fun call stuff because it doesn't let them load. Overall, it does deserve the 2 stars üåü",
"I like the general idea of kids messenger. I'm happy my kids can bond with his cousins virtually, but some things need to change from safety perspective. Deleting photos from a parents end on phone app needs to be easier. Photos were accidentally sent to my kids & I could not delete it unless it was ""reported"" it from my kids first. If no report, can't delete. Then it would only remove from one child's acct. but not my other kid. Good thing i caught the photos first",
"let me save the stickers to my phone. I WILL PAY. for my fricking stickers. they are cute. I want to be able to use the stickers for my normal default texts To. I will pay extra to use them off app. GIVE ME. other than that ENORMOUS problem. it's a very good app easy to use, fun, beautiful stickers. I like that you can block people even if your parents add them and over all I'd say it's a very good app. NOW GIVE ME STICKERS",
This app was good many years ago you could watch the videos see photos but recently if someone sends like many photos at once you can only see the first one and you can't even see or watch the videos can you please fix the bugs,
"I really like the app because I can talk to my grandkids and we can play games and it's more fun than talking to them through just messenger. messenger is boring! I can't send gifs or anything like that to them even though we're Linked In The Family, so that's like kind of stupid and they need some better GIFs but other than that I really like it",
"Glitchy. 2 out of 3 kids can't call anyone because no sound works on calls. Double checked all settings were correct, still wouldn't work. One was logged out of her account and it refuses to let her log back in. Not user friendly when any issues arise.",
"FB needs to get it together. All their apps have issues. FB has issues, business suites have issues and now kids messenger. I can't see my kids when they call me. And they can't see each other when they call. All the permissions are set appropriately. You see the reviews coming in telling you all these apps are broken but zero communication or fixes providing.",
"This app is really great! It's safe for kids and it has games to play with your friends. But I have 1 problem, I keep trying to send messages and it says "" Unable to Send"" and I can't restart it and there are no updates. But overall great app!",
The app has been glitchy for all my kids. One cannot log back in at all. The picture issue another one had in the reviews is happening. Cannot find any solution to log back in except to make a new account.,
I love the app i can chat with all my friends and family but my only issue is not being allowed to send photos which is annoying me and another thing is you can not delete messages and you can not resend the photo you want with the one it says can not send on. When I got logged out I had to wait a while which wasn't fun please add the change group photo.,
For some reason it will say at sleep even when there is still an hour left on the time I scheduled. Then it will not allow me to fix it. Very frustrating!! This has happened several times. I have to delete an reinstall.,
"So fun I can talk 1 on 1 to my closest friends and family you can take hilarious photosüòÇ and send them to friends and you can video chat with him is pretty cool cause it is as clear as day and the best part is it that it is a kids app witch is very fun to play with my favorite. Part is playing games. I would DEFINITELY recommend ""messenger kids"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!üòÅ",
"All good except for; 1. Can't read the messages through parent app for monitoring 2. Need a control option for turning on/off the video chat option for the child to make vid calls, Ive had complaints that she would vid call too much and if anything also include controls who they can/can't bother with video calling and time of day controls or on/off feature for its reading time no messages or distraction time on the tablet/phone.",
"I love this app. I can voice call with my freinds and I love all the filters as well. One thing is that when someone sends a message when it says ""what to recreate there video"" I dont have the icon to recreate there video.",
"This app is great except for the volume on video chats. My daughter loves to chat with friends and family, but it's almost impossible to hear the other person. We have this problem on multiple devices, so it's definitely the app that is the problem.",
"I love it, i can talk with all my BFFs and i love the different filters and new ones come out a lot without needing an update! but one thing i would fix is that i wish it was good for all devices and what i mean by that is by some of the filters i tap on but i wont do anything. But otherwise itS AMAZING",
"I love this app! I love how it tells me when or if someone is online and so much more. The one think I would like for them to change is that you can go into you gallery and choose a photo, idk if anyone else has this problem but for me i don't have the options for filter or gallery",
"Repeatedly attempted to get through account setup. Once I got to taking a picture of my son, no matter what I did (including rebooting, reinstalling, etc.) It just keeps looping, wanting me to accept terms, then take a picture. Will not let me get past this step in account creation, period.",
"i use this app A LOT! it is very good but my only problem is that we cant send links. it would be very helpful since me and my friend watch a lot of youtube and we wanna share videos we find but we cant. we also cant see things as big when we send photos, but its not as bad as a problem. it would be very nice if this was fixed/updated.",
"It was fantastic, and VERY kid-friendly and safe. Only thing (you don't even lose a star for this) is that one parent cant have two kids. If a sibling tries to set up an acount with their dad's facebook and the other sibling already has an account, the first sibling is automatically logged in as the second sibling.",
I think this app is really impressive and I appreciate it whole heartedly.. the only issue I have is the inability to share links.. or even the option the allow the sending of links. It's frustrating.,
"I've had this app since I was 9 and I'm pretty disappointed. I was in the middle of a conversation with my long distance best friend that I hardly get to see and in the middle of a sentence I got logged out of my account. I tried logging back in and ofc it says ""something went wrong please try again"". So I tried multiple times and still nothing happened. Fix ur app bc now I can't communicate with my best friend.",
"THIS APP IS AWESOME! But I cant do things that my friends iPhone can do on it and I makes me mad. But over all this app is awesome for kids to talk to their friends, family members and others. It has a lot of fun little games to challenge your friends to. I just love this app but hope I could do things my iPhone friends could do.",
"One downside that needs to be fixed is the notifications. My child gets no notifications at all or hears anything when someone is calling. Something else I feel they should change is being able to add adults outside of the parents friends list. I am not friends on facebook with my child's father or his mother and it would be nice if I could add them for her so they could be able to talk directly without me. I should still be able to control the adults, but they shouldnt have to be my friend.",
I like it alot but you don't allow bitmoge so I take away points for that,
I downloaded this app on both of my kid's laptops. It doesn't even show up on the screen. It just says close or send feedback.It happens on both laptops. I was really looking forward to this app for my kids. I have uninstalled it from both laptops. (Peyton is my son. He is not leaving this review. I am using his laptop since mine is being fixed.),
"Great app until it randomly logs you out and you cannot log back in! It just repeatedly cycles through the log in page. Have deleted the app, cache, restarted devices, nothing accounts are gone. Not the first time it's happened either! One very upset teenager.",
It is a great app I use it all the time it is a little laggy and it would be great if they could fix that example: when I call my friend it either makes it look like she's spamming mute or the screens just black? But other than that this app is amazing .,
I love this game cuz we're going through right now is very toughand I just need my friendship to you when I have a lot of people downloaded on here and it is very useful when you have no one to talk to your bored or you just need someone to talk to you like I said a million times in their sentence but it doesn't matter I like the quality of the game it is very fast but sometimes it is glitching when you tried to FaceTime!!,
I am a kid using kids messager and I absolutely love it. My dad controls everything and it's a safe free way to communicate with my brothers. It's add free and no bugging you for in app purchases. There are cute funny filters and some cute little games. My little brother is 7 and he can easily operate the app with no issues. I would definitely recommend this app.,
It won't let me text one of my friends for some reason.. 1 second I can then suddenly it stops sending. My wifi is fine and so is the data. I'm not the only person having this problem and will not rate this higher until this bug is fixed.,
Used to love it but now it's unusable. We have sent in reports repeatedly with no follow up. The app crashes every time we try to chat or call. We've done extensive troubleshooting and only get short periods of functionality before it crashes again .,
"It's wonderful however it's not available in some countries. We downloaded it to chat to cousins in the Seychelles, but they say it's not supported there. It would also be great if there was an option to see messages between kids on the parent device",
"Love it, useful, works well. I just wish I had access to the new update. The bubble design with the bright colours look tacky and annoying. I loved the idea if it looking more like normal messenger because my friends had the new update. I never got the update thought. When are all phones getting the update, because I'm sick of the tacky look.",
"its an awesome app, and it doesn't deserve 4 stars just because one issue for Android users. it won't update, so it's been difficult to use the app, I think it's something wrong with the android updates you've been sending out, so please fix that ü•≤üëå",
"This is a great app for kids the only down side of this app is for children who are visually impared can't read the message. for the ones who can't type they can hit a microphone to speek but no accomidation setting for a parent to select to have messages read to them for. when you can hit that accomidation on cell phones tvs but nothing on the app, wish this could be added to the app, when it does will give it a 5 star",
"Absolutely amazing. It's amazing what they provide for everyone. If your not safe with your child texting strangers, you don't have to! You can manage what your child does on this app! Your child can also play games. I think every kid needs this app. It's very protected and safe. Your also managing everything your child does",
"Great app for me I am a kid but I have some things I need to say about calls, 1. The camera filters glitch ALOT 2. Most of the time I call and I cant see them and they can't see me 3. You can't text anybody when your on call you can only text who your on call with witch is really annoying. I hope you found this review helpful and please fix these problems",
I love this app. It is awesome. The reason I am rating 4 stars is because 1. I dont like that you cant deleat you messages. 2. I wish that it was more like regular facebook so that we could have things like stories. Otherwise perfect app! I also dont have the song sharing on my phone. Can you fix that please!!??,
"It stopped working after a few weeks. Messages are not sent, uninstalling and installing again also did not get rid of the error. My kids are completely unable to use it. Quite frustrating for an app from such a big company.",
It would be great if parents could choose to block pictures and videos from being sent. Mostly for my kids contacts. Obviously I trust everyone I've allowed her to chat with but there's nothing stopping her from sending her grandma thousands of photos of her forehead lol. Otherwise it's great.,
"Great app except not getting notifications when there's a message. My daughter has an android phone and all the notifications are turned on for the app, including sound but still doesn't receive any notifications. PLEASE FIX OR ADD NEW FEATURES FOR NOTIFICATIONS",
Great for talking to friends and playing little games plus they also have a little voice command that if your kid can't really spell that good they could always use that and it doesn't have the best service all the time but it's really good at home if you have your internet connected it's really good to play games on there during video talk you can make group chat but one friend has to be friends with all the other friends in the chat so I really like it so y'all should download it too,
"This app is wonderful! I just have one problem though.. when activating the shortcut, a notification appears saying ""shortcut is active"" and you can't get rid of it, but since it registers as a messenger kids notification, the shortcut always has the red dot on it and it makes me think that someone messaged me.",
"I really like this app, but the only isssue i have is whenever i text for to long it was ""unable to send message"" and its really annoying and it doesn't even go away until the next day. I dont know if its an issue for other people or just me so i apologize if im not making any sense but if its not just me, then i consider doing something about it. Overall, this is a really good app and i recommend it üëå",
"So far, I I loving this app. It's super user friendly and allows parents to have full control. I learned the hard way that I needed to set up ""sleep mode"" so that my daughter wouldn't call everyone at 7am!! LOL. Happy that feature was available. She is loving having access to her friends and family to send them love.",
I really enjoy being able to talk and video chat with my daughters when i am not with them. I do not however like that they can send me a bunch of gifs but i am unable to send them back to my children. Other than that i believe this app is a wondeful tool for children to stay in communication with their friends and family.,
"We can't get passed ""authorize device"". We put out login info but it just takes us back to empty login credentials and tells us we have to authorize device, again. We tried it repeatedly, we've tried on different devices, it's still inaccessible.",
good app it's just logs me out all the time for no reason and then I don't see messages that it sends or it just won't let me text people sometimes overall it's a really good app but it has a few flaws including if you don't have Wi-Fi the app doesn't really work text messages disappear and more,
I like this app alot it helps keep my daughter safe but also lets her communicate with her friends without a phone number,
"This is my daughters comment: I thought it was great. During this quarantine it's a great way to keep in touch with family and friends! But I really liked the cat filter and they replaced it. Also, some of my friends have some filters when they're on video chats and I don't. Some of my friends have those filters even when they're not on a video chat.",
"Used to be good, now it's awful. I let my children have this app because as a parent I could keep an eye on what they were doing online. But now I can't access anything (same login errors as so many others have reported lately), I can't change any of the access settings either (eg to give extended access while we're on holiday), & multiple attempts to obtain help have failed. Don't waste your time on this app, it's just another hook to get kids into the facebook\messenger system AND it's faulty.",
"I am a kid and I use this to talk to almost all of my friends and family, it is a great app! Although I would say this app is for users 7+ and I would like you to add voice calls, I currently can only do video calls. Overall the app is amazing though.",
"I really like this app becuase it is simple to use. The only thing I don't like is that when I update my emoji there isn't very many options, I think you should add more emojis. I also think that we should be able to use the poop emoji. I use it a lot. Sure it can be rude but it's not hurtful or offensive. Lastly I think there should be better filters. My cousin is always sending me funny pics with funny filters becuase she has messenger but I'm on messenger kids and the filter aren't very good",
"It just flashes!! I can not do anything! Not even log in. I have this on another device. It works perfect! I do not get this and my son is not happy! I have installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled multiple times!",
"I am giving this 3 star rating, because currently the games and a few other features are not working for me and my child. Also, when the games did work then my childs voice would often not come through during the game. I will update if these are fixed. He has the same problem with voices not going through while playing games. But the games do work for him. I use Samsung Galaxy A51(2022)",
"Messenger Kids is a good app, but it also can be a little annoying. I sent a picture to one of my friends of eminem, and my parent got an alert. Its also really glitchy. If u wanna be a helicopter parent I would download, or maybe if u dont want ur child to have games and just talk with people, but its an overall decent app. Good job! Also includes facetime.",
"this app is pretty good for communicating with your friends when you're a kid. i like how you can customize the color, and have an emoji to repersent yourself. i do think it should have a ""stop video"" option. the call's can be pretty glitchy, and WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE PIG GAME >:(((( anyways, this app is pretty nice overall. SERIOUSLY THOUGH WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE PIG GAME-",
"My kids love this app, they call each other, me and their dad. The sleep function seems to work well. We have it set so they don't call their dad in another time zone too early. It's wonderful that our family can still be connected and play together even when there is nearly 2000 miles between us. I'm also able to send my kids pictures and videos so they can look at them whenever they want. Only downside is you have to know your generated pass phrase to give to friends to add them.",
I only gave 4 stars cause I really wish I could see the messages between my daughter and whomever from my device instead of having to go get hers. Every thing else is perfect. My 8 year old loves talking to her family and friends and i love that messenger gives me the app to let her and let me control it all. It's hard for parents to trust people these day and this let's me be in control. No request goes without my permission.,
"I appreciate this app letting my son have contact with family members on his tablet. I do wish, in addition to the simple controls currently available, that there was an option for enhanced controls. I'd also like an instant, ""pause,"" button to allow me to pause his access during naptime without resetting the sleep hours. Also would love to be able to, ""snooze"" access to contacts, like if he's really bugging grandma, let his access to get pause for a week.",
"Just like a lot of your other consumers, login is my issue. Is there any way to go back to the previous version at least until you are able to debug the most recent version? Otherwise, your app is an useless one that does nothing, but display an icon. I can go to my dashboard, but what is the purpose, if I can't get my child on his messenger app. Give us a clear solution that we can all use, so our children can use their messenger again.",
"Every time i tried to download this app it would tell me that i needed to free up space even thought i had about 4-5 apps. I know that lots of my friends amd cousins have this app and its lots of fun. Every time we face time each other it would let us choose a filter to put on our face! Yoi get to choose who your child talks to. Another thing you should know is that when someone sends a ""friend request"" the request will go to the adults phone then go to the childs phone. This is a great app!",
"Needs to be finished before releasing! This app seems such a good idea, but my granddaughter is already experienced in Msgr vid with its faces, games, and backgrounds. She thought Kids would have games (yesterday), but it didn't. She was very disappointed. Today, 5/31/20, it has games and faces, but you can't tell by looking at the icon which are which. Then it freezes and we have to call again. Or the icons don't work. These are children, Zuck! The app needs to work at least most of the time!",
Can't get this silly app to work. It's frustrating. My daughter uses it to talk to her cousins and friends. Please fix the issue. It just keeps repeating the same thing when u try to sign on I even uninstalled it didn't work üôÉ,
Fix The App!!!!! Have downloaded on 3 devices now and same thing each time!! You go to set up..put in parent email and password then stupid thing just returns directly back to logon. Has happened on all 3 devices and YES my logon details are correct. I even changed my password to see if that make a difference. Nope!!!!,
I'm still mad that I can't change the color of my messages also please bring the chat themes to android,
"Definitely recommend this app for younger kids to keep in touch with family! Nothing goes on without my account being notified first, no one can message or add without my permission either. The app is free and no ads. Definitely a win!",
"Everything is excellent, just one thing, Can you add a feature that if you make a group call with a friend, the friend can add their friend to the group, and also I would want this app on windows 10.",
"I like this app. I have one complaint that has dragged this app down. It will not let me send videos, like a movie or animation i made for friends and family, i have clicked the send button SO many times, and it wont send. Overall, i recommend you should try this app, it could just be me.",
"I've now tried 3 times to load this on my daughters phone. the first 2 I could actually install but like others have said. Couldn't get past the parental login even though my account info is right .Now on the 3rd try (after deleting and uninstalling), I can't even install it . It is stuck at pending........... What in the world happened with this app? Developers please fix !",
"Messenger Kids is a great app. Its a way for kids to get in contact with their friends and family under parent supervision. The parent gets to approve of who your child adds as friends, and The parent can view all of the messages sent. Parents are able to view all messages and pictures sent through the chat. The app also includes child appropriate online games and filters. Its such a cute and fun app for kids! Love, Love LOVE!üíï",
"It was good at first, worked for a year and a half. But now i am unable to text anyone. Not even my bff this was my only way of communication to my friends in america, it hasnt been working for like, 3 days. I really miss my friends alot. Please fix, another thing is they banned my friend for acknowledging that the new strawberry shortcakes skirt is too short, thats messed up. I have half a mind to uninstall and move to another messaging app like Gmail.",
"The app is not working on Samsung TAB A10"" 2021 whenever I try to login to connect the device for my child it's keep coming back to log in page i have tried changing password to uninstalling & installing and restarting its still having same glitch and also the TAB was up to date. I have kids messenger on Samsung TAB A 2019 for my other kid it's work on that but not on this tablet. Emailed the developers did not get any response.",
"I can't text my bestfriend because I keep getting unable to send and yes it gives me a notification but no explanation. I really hate this and I have gotten it for a day and it usually takes a good few hours. I don't recommend it really. All the other features are fine but, nothing special.",
"It would be nice to have it easier to use for parents finding relatives for the kids to talk to. I'm having trouble adding grandparents and aunts. Mind you, I don't get on fb, but have messenger for my daughter to call me. So it would be nice to be able to add relatives without having to add them on fb first.",
"Mostly, we like it. Kiddo loves it, but I've a few issues. First, it's not really user friendly for the parents. I've had difficulty adding new people for her. I get the suggestion to add someone, yet it seems they're not really approved. Another thing, kiddo sent me a message with a GIF. I tried to send her one back & got a message that told me GIFs couldn't be sent in Kid's Messenger. ü§î 1) Why not? & 2) How come she sent me one? And lastly, why can't we ""like"" messages? Overall, just okay.",
This seemed like a good idea to keep in contact with my news but were all having issues with changing our kids info and adding or declining friends we can't access the dashboard. Good idea but bad ending ... maybe once it's all fixed might download again. But we shall see cant even delete our accounts just the app itself. What a shame.,
"This app does not always let you take a video, it sometimes does not even let you see the messages that you send, and sometimes does not let you see the texts people send you, once (as in today) it won't let me text anyone in private, I can only text them if it is on a group, my cousin kept getting mad because it would not let her or me take a video it would just say ""Failed to capture video"" but it still can be REALLY cool",
"Good app, high performance, average layout, way to much battery consumption, and only video call options. No ads, so very happy about that. Overall, very good app for your kids, it's safe, and child friendly.",
I think there is room for improvement. When i launch it on my 2 year-old chromebook it openes in a phone mode by default. when you try to put it fullscreen it comletely gkitches out. Sigh.,
App is not loading conversations only loading group chats. won't show any of the friends. I've undownloaded re-downloaded updated everything I can think of and even contacted support and nothing has changed. Can't communicate with anybody on the app please fix. I talked to some of my other mom friends whose kids have the app and everybody's having the same problem.,
I love this app. It shows you everything your kids are doing you control whose friends with them. But I really enjoy the silly faces they can do during a call & that you can snap a photo of it! Awesome!,
It is fun for a child... if it works. My child got a new device and wanted to change the account to that device. But when I put in the passcode it just looped back to the beginning of the page. This keeps repeating. I would give it 5 stars if not for this bug.,
"My feedback is more about the interaction between regular Messenger and Messenger Kids. It would be good if, when conversing with a kid account, regular Messenger could access the same features as kids. My child loves to send me the 'would you rather' questions and it would be great to have something similar to send back. Would also be good if the filters when facetiming with a kids account were restricted to safe ones. Some of the ones I have experimented with are a bit scary.",
Great option to connect kids during the shelter at home life. Good parental controls and process for connecting kids. Would be nice to not display online status when the app isn't open (like a parent is using the phone and not the child).,
"My son loves using this app but it is caught in a loop at the sign in. I tap his account and it says ""ask a grown up for help. It looks like something has gone wrong."" Then it prompts me to sign in again only to repeat that process. Broken. Please fix this! His friend is having the same problem.",
"Looping through confirmation!! I'm wondering if FB reads their ratings, so many complaints about confirmation looping and no responses or fixes. I have messages waiting and can't get to them. Smack those brain cells together and fix this simple bug, yes, I write program.",
Great app but in call the games that you have to tap on the screen it won't work. Example the game where you have to land the shape in the correct spot when I tap it won't work. This is happening with my bestie to please fix this!,
"App no longer works. It won't let my kids log in and keeps asking for ""parent verification"" but when I type in my password it just takes us back to the parent verification screen. I know I am using the correct password, and it's not my device because the same thing happens on my laptop and my husband's phone.",
"I'm having the same problem as Ryan Murray. When I try to authorize device using my wife's account it just loops back to authorize again. When I try with my own account (as authorized paret/guardian) it keeps saying ""The user is not allowed to log into this app."" I give it 2 stars because it works for my 2 of my kids that got messenger a couple of years ago. Although I remember that we had trouble setting it up for them too.",
"It is great for kids to have a safe texting experience, and the games are easy and funüëç",
Unable to open app in the past month. (Android user) Continually asks for login info and then crashes. Have never had problems with app until recently! Checked for recent update and none are available. Hope developer can fix soon so we can access this tool for our kids!,
"The app is good and fun but I wish that you could click on a text that a friend sent you and then it would allow you to answer it, send something back or copy it. I also wish that it was a bit like messages",
cool app for my baby to use and it is safe as long as the people you allow her to speak to are safe. I just havent yet found how to review her messages from my phone. she uses the app on her own phone via wifi which is great because she can call her brothers without having to ask us. she keeps in touch with her cousins and family friends. very helpful app.,
"I've spent an hour trying to add a friend to my daughter's account that already has other friends. Have been working hand in hand with the mom and nothing is working. Connected the mom's account but not the child's. Tried connecting as Facebook friends...even though it says you don't have to be. Now as friends, trying to look her up, and her name won't even come up. This has been a literal hour of pure frustration and of course there is no way to contact someone to help with it! üò°",
"Great platform! Kids love it! I have control to supervise except unable to view their video chats. Also, I needed to transfer parental guardianship to another parent's account to take over. Had to open new kids accounts and re-invite their friends before closing original parent's account. Should be an easy option to add. Otherwise all good thanks!",
"Glitchy, keeps locking us out so it won't work. No help button so have to email for support",
"Okay, could be better with adding friends. I've had some issues for nearly 2 years trying to just use the app. Then finally I was able to. Unfortunately after a while I had to create a new account because I wasn't able to add friends. So now she has a new account and we have to add everyone again. A little annoying",
"It's really fun I call my friends so we can play Minecraft or Roblox or just chat! The one thing I don't like is how it disconnects some times in the middle of the call and just goes ""beep ,beep ,beep"" u ril k hang up, and then I have to call again..",
"It it great! The only reason I give it four stars is because my son came to me and said that the phone was glitching, and apperentling when your playing with the person who's on a call with you, the phone glitches and you can do nothing about, I even got a new phone and it still does it, please fix this.",
It is great and can connect with family even though my kid has privacy but can moniter her!,
App is NOT working. Same bug as the other reviews. Cannot log in once logged out. Authorization page reloads when attempting to log back in. Cleared cache and storage. Re downloaded. Tried from different devices. Same result. Cannot access this app.,
"great app for my son, very good",
I think this app is so much fun I love calling me friends if i'm busy then I can just call them later or we can just text and tell each other when we can call or play. We have Roblox so it makes it easy to play with them because we play Roblox and call because when you leave the app on a call it does not get rid of the call that you're on at that moment. I don't know if this happens for anyone else I have been trying to sit here for ten minutes trying to load messenger kids but I do have messenger kids on my computer and my computer has bad internet so I don't know if it's messenger kids or my computer because everything else is working right now.,
"Terrible. Too hard for parents to manage. Would give zero stars if possible. Parents must have the Facebook app installed to manage kids. Facebook lite doesn't work either. Cheap under handed way to get us to install app. Won't do it. Plus, if you don't set up a friend code first thing, you can't do it later and the requests from kids to do this doesn't come through so they can't search friends without a request, fine, but the links don't work even if you approve.",
"This app is mostly great, but Im upset that I cant send links to my own kid. I want to be able to share educational material with my kid and any text i send her with a link will not be sent. I cannot find where to fix this in parental controls. Give me a way to fix this, to control which of her contacts can and cannot send her links, and I will gladly give this app a perfect rating.",
"I really think this is an amazing way to communicate with friends and family. I would recommend this app I wouldn't rate this perfectly to my opinion, because you can't use it without Internet. I've tried using this app in a hotel with bad Internet and it said ""Please connect to internet"" But I enjoy calling my friends.",
"My opinion is that this is a great app! But the only think wrong is that only apple phones/iPads get to pick a gallery picture. I really hope you can fix that! My phone is the motorala mg 6play :) I hope you can make andorid people get a picture from the gallery! Please respond! I like how you can get out of the app and still talk with friends. And make groups! There's so much stuff! I really recommend messager kids for your child :) that's all I have to say, Bye üíóüíü",
My daughter loves this app she can talk to all her friends and family members near and far. The best aspect of this app is that she cant add anyone without my approval and there is no ability to wander on facebook. Its purely an app associated with messenger. It gives kids a sense of independence and teaches them how to communucate online efficiently,
"I love it! It is safe, fun, and overall great. I wish that it was possible to edit it more or have videos longer than a minute. I would recommend this to you and any kids who want to talk to their friends. It is very useful during quarantine.",
It's a good app but there is 3things wrong about it. 1: we should Be able to text links. 2: is it just my internet or does the call not go through sometimes. 3: we should just be able to just regular call like on messinger. Those are some bad things about nessinger kids but otherwise it is a good app.,
"Fun app for kids. Unfortunately, when we moved from the US to Europe, it turned out the app is not available in this region. But as a parent I keep getting notifications that my kids are getting messages from their friends that they cannot access. Now that they actually don't get to see their friends in person and want to exchange messages and video calls, they can't.",
"It was working for months, until 2/4/20. When I tap the app, it's like you're swiping the picture of the app to the right rapidly. I can't get in it just rapidly like open and close the app. Until this is fixed, one star. I don't like this.",
"Aggravating. Have to download Facebook app to add contacts. Download Facebook app, does not show anywhere to add contacts. Go to Facebook via Chrome, says I have to download Facebook app to add contacts. It is a circle that never ends. Think it is also too easy for kids to send pics of their scores constantly to all of their contacts, etc",
"It's a Great app! But there is a problem.. Every time somebody sends me a message, My tablet dings but it's not that loud.. So if you can fix the notification sound for it to be louder i would really like that Thank you!",
This is one of the best apps ever. If you want your kids to have fun while taking to family members and friends this is a great way without having to have them talk over you phone. They can send funny photos and can even facetime. One of the best apps ever created SUPER KID FRIENDLY,
"very cool because you can take pics and choose them as profiles and you can play game with friends and choose your message color and make group chats and grow up your personal pet you can take pictures with your pet send gifs, pics, make art and drawings with stickers too and sent them, its really nice! i wish that you could upload pics that you already have though. theres also tons of filters that change often. one thing you need to fix is sometimes my friends that i chat with dissapear!!",
Well I would Love to give this app 5 stars but there are 3 things that bug me you can't connect you microphone to a bluetooth headset when calling there is no audio call only video and last when you are on a video call you can't turn Your camera off without not being able to still see the person your talking too apart from this the app is great and the app won't let you send links,
"This is an excellent parent friendly app that's easy for parents to monitor while giving younger kids the freedom, convenience and fun of messaging friends and family! I also like the ""sleep"" option which let's parents set the days and times their child can use the app.",
"Every time I try and set up my sons account it says something has gone wrong and I can't. He had an account previously, which stopped working, and now we can't access it OR make a new one. It was the only way he got to see his friends during this pandemic. Don't bother with this app.",
"amazing app and great for kids to keep in touch with friends and family. only reason I didn't give five stars is bc the video calling needs improvement. calls were lagging, freezing up and dropping the call. please fix this as it is very important for some families to have this video calling part",
"Frustrating with absolutely no help when asked. I wanted something more secure for my kids so they could have video calls with their Dad, who lives 7 hours away. I loved the security features that prevented them, anyone else from adding random people without my permission, and how those permissions would go to my phone directly. Trying to add their Dad to it is impossable without him having to register as a child. Seems to be just for parents with kids. They cant add him, and if I can, no help.",
"I love this game The part i dont like is that whoever controls the app theire contacts kids , u can onley have them and you can also have adults like family. Also after about a month some of the filters go away u can save fotos frome other people just by 2 clicks One part i dont like about it is that you cant save videos frome other people also u cant send poop emojis whitch is stupid exept on the thing up top when u have to swipe down theres a little arow at the side click and you can textüí©",
SERIOUSLY needs a landscape mode. I can't believe it isn't an option for keyboard connected tablets. how hard could that possibly be to implement? -- the regular Messenger app handles it just fine.,
Hi so today messenger kids log out so decided to uninstall and sometimes freeze up on video call. So we have to end the call and then come back to another call and you should have more games because and more options for the drawing game ABC like alphabetical order so no one gets same thing for drawing game . Next recommendation that me and my friends recommend is make video longer. üòéüòéüåàüåà I just install it you have to make a brand new account while you already have account .,
"It is a really good app, because you can have face filters and texting and facetime. Without needing to worry what device you have. I suggest download this app for your kids. You can also text whoever you want! With of course your code. I have downloaded it and i have lots of people i can chat and facetime with! (^o^)",
I like the idea of the app. However the volume settings suck. There is next to no sound and thats with my phone volume all the way up. Also i hate the split screens,
"As a child's point of view, I love it! So does my mom! I get to chat all day long. But there's only one bug. Every time I start a chat my friend answers then it goes straight to a ringtone noise and says he's muted and video off but he's not! We always have to end it and re-call.",
"The thing is, is that you cant delete messeges on there. there is no way you can delete messeges on that app and it makes me REALLY REALLY frustraited and you will sometimes regret typing anything that was on a topic. like if you accadentily sent someone like lets say an emberising text or photo. you will try to delete it but i am just gonna tell you you CANT! and that really bothers me sooo... I would be careful of what you type.",
It started out great but all of a sudden I no longer get my child notifications anymore and there is no where to change it so I can get them again. This is not ok whole point of this app is the overseeing there interaction with there friends,
I love this app. I can see all my child's conversations and can control who she can talk to,
this app is Great for kids all though the filters/games dont work and will only work on specific devices,
Sooo all it dies is crash so anoying i can not add my daughters peofile picture without it turning side ways. Please fix,
I rate it 5 because I don't use it that often but when it comes to talking to my 7 year old brother it's great I love the little games in it that you can play with little kids and the way it's set up makes it easy for the kids to pick up what to do. Overall I'm really impressed with the quality and the app in generalüòçü§ó.,
So I made a account but it kept saying SOMTHING WEN'T WRONG TRY AGAIN I've been doing that for the past 2 minutes Fix it please!,
Honestly love this option for kids to safely chat with friends and family. However my current issue is that my parent account that is linked to my children's kids messenger accounts was hacked and deleted by the hacker....therefore I no longer have access to my kids accounts. My kids still currently have access to their kids messenger accounts but I don't feel comfortable with that seeing as I have no way to over see anything. How do I deactivate their accounts without having access? HELP!,
"lets me talk to my friends, but sometimes on any device, it disconnects automatically no matter what i do",
"My kids have a really fun time on this app, talking to friends!",
"Looks like a great app. However, I cannot login to it and keeps getting errors. I've tried troubleshooting many ways to no avail. It seems like it is a deadend everytime.",
"This is perfect for anyone who wants to keep tabs on your child, but it's the ability to see a d talk to your child, especially young children. I'm in a really bad situation with my ex and how he's become so controlling. When she's at 'home"", I miss her and this allows me to see and hear her. It tells me her location, time online and what apps she's been on. My only suggestion is to have a way to know if her father is looking through it or how to detect that.",
"It is a amzing app, it is very easy to control and you can have limited friend! You can also make group chats with as many people you like. When I got this app I knew it was going to work for for me and my friends and it did! I really recomend that you should get this app if you cant have permision for contacts or messenger. Oh and befor I forget to tell you, you can make a pet an you take care of it, it gets older and when it gets old enough it will set off then you get a brand new pet!!!",
"I think the app is pretty good, especially for video calls and messaging but one thimg I don't like is that it doesn't have very good gifs. What I mean by that is that the gifs included don't have that much meaning and it is hard to find to find an actual meaningful gif. Other than that, I think it is pretty good.",
"Good app but sometimes the messages won't send! It says it's sent, but it hasn't sent. I have tried with wifi on, even the best wifi. But It will not work. Love the filters, and yeah.",
"Whereas it is nice to be able to control the people my kid could talk to through this app, there is no functionality to delete any messages, pictures or videos sent. So in terms of security in this sense, it is poorly designed and unworthy of recommendation for others to use.",
"Only really use this app to talk to one of my younger friends. Works fine, takes up quite a bit of space (i understand it is a messaging app but i only have 6 apps and i have 23% of my space taken up, just for this app.) just wish you would add the ""change colour"" feature back aswell.",
"Cannot get past the Terms page. Continually gives an error and says to try again later. Tried multiple devices (6 total) and it will not load. Failure as an app. The promise is good, but totally wasted. Develop better troubleshooting measures before deploying.",
"I think it is grate for kids to use to text people,so strangers can't hurt you kids. It keeps them safe",
"Really good app! I love how u can make ur own colored theme, I like the GIF and emojis and finally I really like how u can just find people by code! Just one problem... I wish you could make groups without everyone having to be friends. It's pretty annoying to me. But the app is really good! I talk to my friends everyday on that app. Ty!",
"great app. i love video calling with this. i wouldnt need to use it but i noticed they dont have an option to delete messages, wich is understandable, it is an app for kids and the parents might want to supervise. they have the most stupid filters, everytime they actually have a good filter or a game to play with friends they get rid of it. adult messenger has better filters that are very child appropriate.",
Very good for kids to get contact woth their friends on the holidays or weekends.,
"It used to be amazing. However, I got a new phone and signed in a different account. I created a new account and it said that there was an error creating the account. I tried all sorts of things to get it to work. Reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, and others tricks that didn't work. I have no idea what is going on, but it needs to be fixed.",
I love the freedom ir gives my girls to talk to their friends and family members while still being safe and secure. I dont like thar I can't search someone on my friends list to add for them. It makes it frustrating to have everyone up but the name I'm looking for. Not all my friends are their friends..,
"Great app. I think this is a really great app for kids, although it would be better if the app had a facebook page and you was able to post kid friendly memes and all the people you are friends with gets to see your content. All I'm saying really is that it would be even better if it was just like facebook, but for kids.",
"This app is impossible to navigate. I have 2 kids. I can't view both kids accounts. If I delete app and reinstall, I can view the second kid, but then can't view the other again. I'm pretty tech savvy. Do better!",
"Terrible. I had to delete a contact to erase the messages, and now it will not let me add contacts. I hit approve (parent controls) and it says ""Error Occured, try again later:. It's been 3 days I've been trying to connect this person to their contacts, and it shows an error message. App worked fine up until that point.",
"I love the way that this app lets children text other people, but the parents have to approve of the people that they can text, and video call. But I don't really like that you can't delete stuff, like what if you have a typo and it says something like a cuss word. Like what if your trying to type ""I almost got shot in the game."" But it instead of ""shot"" it types a cuss word. But other than that I think this app is very good. You also have to connect it to Facebook messenger account for parents.",
"This app is amazing and all but the only thing for me is that fact that it only lets me type or send photos so many times. Then it just will stop allowing me to send messages. So I hope this can be fixed, but other than that this app is amazing and I can chat with my friends and all.",
"I do like it I love talking to friends, but when I try to talk and play games at the same time, sometimes it will kick me off and make me recall. This only happens on my end, none of my freinds have this happen. Other than that it's good! Edit- it was actually just my device. Works fine now!",
Great app in general has helped my oldest be more independent and able to contact me without having to have his own phone as hes still too young in my opinion. I would prefer to have a full access to see his messages or set word alerts to alert me when anyone uses them.,
it just suddenly stopped working like a week ago on my tablet. The screen goes black and the app crash down. I use it to chat with my girls now I can't. Uninstalled-reinstalled nothing works! Judging by the increased of 1 star lately my bet it has to do with the latest update - please fix!!!,
"For a few months, this app was very useful and the only complaint I had about is the text message (while calling) didn't work. But now it won't even let me call anyone or use the camera, it doesn't even let me take photos. Checked the app, it didn't need updating. Please fix this!",
"It won't let me login to my kid's phone, even on my phone. Already verified device and keeps coming back to login, asking for password and just going back and forth. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times and the same thing happens. Not happy as I already invited some family members but the app is not working.",
"Great App for kids to connect without using an actual phone. can sign in from child's tablet and parents device so you can view conversations easily. just want to see a temporary sleep feature so parents can easily change it to sleep mode during dinner, not just set times (which is a huge hassle to change daily).",
"Sound won't connect via Bluetooth headphones. We have tried every work around possible. My child broke the headphone port so we only have Bluetooth headphones for sound on her tablet and messenger refuses to produce sound via headphones. It's the same on all devices we have tried. Please fix this, we need to be able to use headphones.!!",
"I set this app up for my younger sister, and one of her contacts got hacked, and started sending completely inappropriate things. The keyboard is also very glitchy, and when you send a message, it doesn't send right away.",
"App downloads. But wont allow proper set up? Photo up. Name there. Friends added, Message notifications come through but no messages actually show up. Have tried to youtube how to fix it, but no luck.",
"So, I've had this since last year, and after a while I wanted to change my profile to one of the stuff in my gallery, I went to profile and saw gallery isn't an option. I wish it was. I get it if using just face to recognize people, but my friend said that sending a picture to the parent who set up their Messenger Kids and said the parent can make it the kid's profile, but I'm very private about my stuff. I would appreciate if gallery was an option. P.S. I barely got notifications before update",
I love this app but if want to add more friends then you have to type a 14 digit code and you won't be able to know their code because a lot of stuff to get the code for the person you want to add. The filters are pretty useless but I don't use anyway. You can tell that this app is most definitely for kids younger than me....!,
"I'd really like to love this app, but my child does not get notifications when she has a message. I have gone into the device settings to make sure everything is working properly, and it is. We've been having issues with it for months now. Very irritating.",
"It does not let you ""authorise account."" It just constantly loops back to the sign in page, despite entering the correct password and using one time passwords. Super frustrating.",
"Was loving this app for my kids to communicate with family overseas. However, now I am unable to log my kids into the app. I keep getting error messages that I am not authorized to log into the app although the child accounts are through my Facebook account and still accessible to manage from my Facebook app. I've sent several messages to support and received zero response. Also, app is fully updated. Would rate the app higher if I could actually use it.",
"If you or your child is below 10 it is a good texting app but if you are 12 and up it is not fun,rather just have messenger. It keeps your child safe but it is very childish and not fun for older kids. Also very nad quality when calling. They should make an audio calll avaible too. Games are not very fun once you are older than 7. If they made an app that is protected like this one but made for tweens and teens. I would get that one. But otherwise it is horrible app for ages 12 and up.",
Horrible turns off every minute,
"Esay to use if I could use it. App says I have no internet when I do have internet. Can't call or text people, can't see pictures I'm sent, and this didn't just happen once. Every time I opened the app it claims I have no internet. I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the app but it still claimed I had no internet. I contacted their support via Gmail and gave them Screencast proff,but they haven't replied. Overall terrible, just based of the fact that I can't even use it if I wanted to.",
"I bet the app is really good but there's a glitch. When my friend sending me the invite so I can chat with her daughter it brings me to a page that says ""Enter your child's name"" and and then send me to confirm screen and glitches out. Because of this I haven't been able to use the app on my phone.",
I love to us this app every day to grow my pet and talk to my bff that I never get to talk to over summer and when we're on breaks from school. One of my favorite things to do on this app is to draw something and they have to guess. I also like how you can create groups. I love how you can play games while talking to someone. I love this app a lot so that's why I gave it a 5 star rating. I recommend this app if you want to talk to friends far away and you don't get to hang out with them often. ‚ù§,
I use it every day and it works all the time but i dont know why but a few days ago i was texting my friend and the texts were not going though and the texts where saying unable to send and this is the first time that proplem as happened twice in a row and this has never happened before so I am pretty mad that this happing to me but if you can please fix that and the notfictions because I never get those anymore.,
"This is a good app, i can call my friends and family, but you can't make a group without one being one's contact and that is a problem. Me and my friends have dealt with a bug, which makes our accounts not allow more than 14 contacts at a time, so please allow us to make a group without one being one's contact",
This bloody thing is stupid!!! I purposely decided to get my daughter her first phone for her birthday tomorrow so she can contact me while im at work AND more importantly I thought it'll be safer than putting a sim card in. But I cant even set the useless thing up!! It keeps saying my FB password is incorrect. I've even gone through the trouble to change my password just in case but obviously that is not the case!! If there is a minus to rate I'd rate minus. Not happy at all.,
Absolutely love having for my youngest. She's 10 and there is to many crazy ppl in the world to let her have her own fb page. Thabkful for this app so she can stay in touch with family and friends and I'm the one who approves her friends and can monitor everything to make sure she's safe from sickos!!,
I love this app I can communicate with all of my freinds so easy. The controls are not hard so kids can talk with friends so easily. The only thing I would change would be to add more cutsie filters other than that I love it.,
"This is a very good app, it's a great way to call with friends, especially when they don't have a phone number. The reason I'm rating this 4 Stars is because I think it could be better. Maybe add a dark mode, and maybe make more of an assortment of colors? Thanks!",
"sometimes disconnects randomly, you cannot send links and also cant send certain emojis, you cant put different names for a person, and you cannot delete messages which is very irritating, and also you cant chage the pictures of groups. Please fix some of these things!!!!!!!!!!",
"Great for language arts! My son struggles with language arts skills, he's also in a special reading group at school but I have noticed a HUGE improvement in reading and spelling. I love how as a parent account, I can add or delete people and see his full conversations. There does seem to be an issue with the sleep time mode, with 8am and 8pm selected on weekday mode and 8 am and 10pm selected for weekday mode, it keeps putting his account in sleep mode despite the selected times, I turned it off.",
"Not working!! This was five stars but yesterday when I was trying to sign in on my s8, it says account failure. Something went wrong while trying to create an account for your child. The app is updated. This was working great last week Monday. What the heck is going on? Fix it!! I use this to keep in contact with my young child while I'm at work. I had to download a new app on this phone the s8 and my other phone the note 10+ very unacceptable! Tried clearing the kids messenger app nothing",
"Good for kids but.... I can't figure out how to stop my cell phone from ringing every time my child receives a call from a friend. There's times I'll be doing something on my phone and specific friends can't get through so they will continue to keep calling after I send a message saying ""I can't talk right now"" or stop the call. Is there a way for me as the parent, to turn this feature off? It's becoming a nuisance 4 me.Or can I delete the (kids messanger) app entirely from my device? Thank you",
"Worked fine until I had to reset my daughters device and now just like others report it won't log in. Absolutely useless trying to find anywhere to contact someone about the issue either - just get sent in loops in their ""support"" area with no actual ability to file anything.",
"This app is amazing safe use you can chat with freinds and family it's literally the best message app I have ever tried out! All you need is a but of parental help then your free to chat , send photos , and even video chat! I recomend it for everyone under the age of 15 as long as you can right of course .if your older then probally messager! üòÄbest part no ads üôÉ",
The new update is horrible and all the filters I like are gone and the games don't work on call and it is laggy and it doesn't let u stay on call and play games and half of the filters are broken.so please get a better update and it's super pixely and it takes up so much storage in my device.,
"To me it's awesome! I tried to send a link to a picture and it said unable to send, I knew something like that would happen, not only that I had a bad feeling in my stomach, I didn't want to do it and don't know why I did it, sorry for trying to send a link, also! I have a suggestion, can you add, where you can like make group chats and play a game where you have to read a chapter or something for like 7+? I'm just asking, if you can't that's fine, have a great dayüòäüòä(I didn't know sorry)",
"Love the app! I can text my friends and family safely! The only problem is that I dont get any notifications when someone texts me. And that is very frustrating to me. Other than that, it's good.. very good app üëçüèª",
Looping parents log in. So app does not work. It as of there is no app. Like it doesn't exist. Almost as if it was never created. Feels like it is a worm hole and just loops. Really like deja-vu or maybe closer to Bill Murray in Ground Hog Day. Just keeps going and going like this review telling you it doesn't work.,
Very nice platform my kids very save hooo.,
"Great for the kids & there friends to keep in contact over the school holidays. Could do with update to allow parent of child more accessibility in what they are able to send thier kids directly. Tried to share a educational short clip video via FB but comes up unavailable to view on my childs tablet app. Another thing... Notifications of new messeges don't seem to come through unless app is already open? A dark mode option would be a great idea too. Other than that, I'm pleased with this app.",
It seems like the latest update has a bug. I can't login as others have recently experienced. It just keeps looping at the authorization screen. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.,
They Won't add my kid. Failing to add by error dead end,
It's so good me and my friends talk ever day totally 5 starts,
Amazing hard to raise pet games are confusing and hard,
The only minor detail that I don't like is that the ringer never cuts off automatically after a specified time if not answered. The friends call and just let it ring and ring. I can end the call manually but if my hands are tied and my daughter isn't around to answer it rings for way to long.,
Used to absolutely adore this app and was the only way to communicate with my kids since they don't have their own phone lines yet. Now I cannot even get them logged in and it's the exact same issue all the PPs have stated. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP. My kids are frustrated. I'm frustrated. Their friends are frustrated ü•¥,
App is not working. I had issues with one of my kids messenger accounts and now basically asks me for my account password numerous times and never logs me on so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it thinking that would fix the issue and now it works for one my kids and not the other. Make sure you don't uninstall it thinking that it would be the fix. Please update asap.,
"This app is infuriatingly difficult with me. I don't think I'm the only person who has this issue. I can't log into it for my kid to be able to use it. I put in my login info and put in a verification code, it just loads and goes back to the login page. I tried changing my password and a few other things but nothing works.",
Audio cannot be heard coming out of the phone's tiny earpiece (not speaker) during a video call. How do you enable speaker phone or Bluetooth audio options? The other person doesn't want to see video of the inside of Mt ear when I'm trying to hear what they are saying!,
So as much as I love this app there's 2 issues or else it would be 5 star!! One is that I do not have to option to do anything with my pet where my sister and friends do? My mom also doesn't understand this? Please tell me what to do.. the second issue is that on apple you can change your profile picture for your gallery or take a photo.. on Android I can not and neither can my sis please get back to me and tell us what we can do to fix this!! Thanks!!,
"My 5 year old loves to send messages, mostly cute stickers, to me and other family members. I have complete control over who she has on her Messenger to contact and of who can message her. She mostly messages me, often when I'm in the same room, trying to work üôÉ. Its been great for her learning to spell too. She is eager to reply when someone sends her a message with words. But the stickers, I believe, are her favorite.",
It is a good app. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would like to change my name because my parents are busy working and I have now become Trans and changed my name but I can't change the name on my own. also I would like to change the color of my text bubbles and themes like in the adult messager. I am 12 years old and some of the 'fun' stuff isn't fun because of my age. I would recommen that you make some games for the older kids please.,
Its so bad i cant even create an account and because of that i got kicked from my real acc and i dont have my family so i cant contact them anymore,
Its fine but there's not much filters and you have to video call and you can't even send videos you have to take pictures step by step from the video how is this supposed to be enjoyable for the pepole who use this app and if they use the app roblox and their screen blacks out and their screen might not turn or if they walk it will turn their screen up and have to rejoin and thats just annoying,
I like this app I use it because some of my friends don't all have messenges and stuff but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think you should be able to delete your messeges I know it's so your parents can see and delete but it could just send something as your child has deleted a message and they could ask about it. Say you sent something embarrassing to someone else like your sibling. but on the good side I like how you can video chat and go into other apps and play other games,
"So many things to work on, and it's FRUSTRATING. First I thought the invites were the chat invites, devs should take away that, it's confusing. Second, in the add option I can't add my (parent's) friends to add on my kids messenger. Limited friends to add, those are only with the kids messenger user whom I don't even know. Update this app more so it's useful.",
"I'm simply giving two stars, it works well. Just after the recent update the group chatd were not working and it would close after I tried opening it then wouldn't open at all. I tried deleting then reinstalling it and instead everything has been removed for me, others can still see my original but I cannot. I would like to be able to access the original AND have my chats working correctly please.",
It was working great until the last update. Now we can't see our preview screen and just get black on the top half. Please fix this or let us know if we need to complete some sort of setting adjustment. Thank you.,
"Amazing! Been using this for a while to call/text with my friends! But, it kicks me out of the call sometimes. and its so annoying. I would recommend this app if it stopped doing that, but right now, I wouldn't even share anything THAT good about it. But, overall. Great app!",
"All in all, its a good app for my daughter to use to talk to her friends. I would like to see options to customize the account. My daughter wants to swich emojis like I can. She also wanted to add a frame to her picture like I can on my Facebook profile. I can lag a little though.",
Most of the calls show up black. You have to call them multiple times to see them. It says contacting when you call somebody so there phone never rings unless it says calling. All of the calls are glitchy and pixalated. The videos dont send either. Sometimes your volume will be all the way up and you CANT EVEN here them!! Also do not disturb dosent work. And when I got the app there was no thing that said allow acsess location. But now its sayd Messenger kids based on yout location.NotGreat.,
This is a very good app for when you're trying to text your friends when your kid like me Abuelita's years old and my mom told me about this app all my friends have it and it's so awesome you can draw pictures and you can send pictures you can text your friends you can video call them it's all you need for texting in one app. 10 out of 10 would recommend,
"camera suddenly not working. It says failed to take photo. We've tried updating, uninstalling, reinstalling and nothing works. Her account works perfect including photo taking on my phone but not the tablet. Can someone help?",
"HELP ME! Great app but its always not letting me call,listen to voice messages,and I can't watch vids I would give 5 stars but I can't I'm trying to delete it and download it again but...of course...ITS NOT LETTING MEE,I love the app but I miss it sometimes I can't even read texts.",
I love this app and its very fun but there has been problems with the audio and the videos and every ones and while it always say unable to send so i have to get the app again but its a very great app to talk to friends on and i really love all the games you can do when your on call with your bff its really amazing!!üòä,
"These people need to fix the app's issues I'm on an older phone, and I can't set up a messenger for my son, and it is sad, because these people won't do anything! If anyone else has these issues as well, or if you think about your child this app, I wouldn't recommend this, just get another app. ( This may apply if you have an older phone)",
I like that it is safe for kids but a problem I have been having is that I can't see pictures or profiles. My calling barely works. I don't get notifications either.üòë if this all can get fixed I would love it and I think a lot of others would too,
I think it's really cool my friend made my account but for some reason my account has a bug that says my app went to sleep but the time is not 10:00 when I open the the app when I right this at is at 2:04 anyway please fix this bug it's very annoying and I can't text my friends at all! ( let me now if this happens to you to),
"Awesome ... This app is just AWESOME !!! My parents have no trouble with controlling my contacts ect. This app makes my life so much easier in quarintine (so that I can talk to my friends) ... Just awesome (^!^) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, In some of the games that are in the app would not load but other than that everything else is great/awesome/unbelivable ( Unbeliveible in a good way ) I really think you should get this app ... you will not be disapointed withi it ... Like i said before, Awesome !",
I would like it to be easy to add friends for instance if I was to type in there name if I typed the full name for it to come up with them and also to change the contact names of singular people,
"App was working perfectly for ages until recently, now it is a continuous login loop. Unable to get past the login page. Very frustrating the adults and disappointing for the child. I hope you can fix the issue soon",
"This is a great app, I can talk with all of my friends but sometimes the app won't send my messages when I have perfectly good internet. I'm writing this while this was happening. My friend and I were texting while on a call, and I sent a message but it didn't send. I have full bars and great connection. Why does this happen, is it just me?",
The game is good but something is wrong when I try to play a game it won't let me click like example when I click the game that has the one eyed monster on the front when I click it it doesn't move or anything can you please fix it and everything is nice but there is that one problem,
"It doesn't give me my notifications very often. Yesterday, it just showed up that I had messages and a missed video call from May 3rd. Would be great if the glitches would get fixed.",
So far we like it but there are a few things I'd like to see added/changed. 1. Volume on video chat is incredibly low and can't be turned up. 2. I would like to be able to see my child's conversations with others through my own device and 3. App can only be used with people who have a Facebook account. Would like to see if it is possible to extend this to non Facebook users. Otherwise my daughter is loving it.,
My stroke is a super fun and I love to play with my cousins and friends.,
No Facebook? So because I don't have Facebook apparently I can't use this app?,
It's been great for my kids who are just branching into the social media scene. Everything is monitored so I can see if they are sending or receiving anything inappropriate. Most reviews seem positive. Negative reviews seem to mostly have the same few issues. Stands out to me that there is no developer's response to any of the reviews. Negative or positive.,
"Video calling is good for nothing. Can't add any contacts that aren't specifically on personal FB friend list. Have never once gotten any notifications/updates about my children's activity, beyond ONE at first use after downloading. Hundreds of messages my children have semt using this app, I have yet to receive a single notification about a single activity of theirs in app. This app is just a children's FB messenger, NOT SAFE DUE TO PARENTAL MONITORING INABILITY!",
I don't really get notifications,
"Thus app was great. Suddenly my daughter can't message any of her kid friends one on one, and there's no technical support for me to figure out how to fix it. Some assistance with fixing my daughters app would be greatly appreciated.",
I like the app I think it's really good.. my personal opinion on the app. I think one change that should be made is instead of letting the kids block whoever they want to block that they should get the parents permission first because of maybe some differences the kids are having. Which could be over something very silly and is no need to block someone for that.,
"Messenger kids is a great app, but sometimes there is glitching in talking, and for some reason the gallery for photos to put for ur profile pic is only on iPhone. Please make an update and fix thses changes. Thank you for reading this!",
"This is an invaluable service that Facebook has provided for us parents. I have full control of who my child can connect with. No creeps will be able to reach him. The only thing I need from this service is the ability to add more than 1 additional parent/guardian. I need to be able to add grandparents, step-parents, etc.",
"I really love this app!The instructions are so easy, especially for the little kids on here.however, I have one complaint. When someone sends you a photo, why can you not save it to your camera role?please fix this, that would be amazing!",
Uh I can't use the voice changing wich is quite frustrating. It doesn't give me a option to update the app so please fix this there's many other bugs but it's good for texting I believe it can improve with work.,
"We were never able to use app. It only shows notification, but going on desktop to Facebook messenger only allows you to invite people from you personal facebook contacts and not enter codes or approve it. Also, app does not allow parents to approve requests direct within the app.",
"This app is the best it has the best communication. And speaking to one another on just messenger kids. This app you can use it anywhere and anytime. And it's good communication with your family members and your friends, it also helps you put words in the right places. Download this app it's a good app for kids and grown ups.üòä",
"Very nice app, but it started crashing every time I try to open it. I have tried clearing space, clearing cache, restarting my device, and uninstalling and reinstalling.",
"I can't get past the sign up page I've been trying to create an account for my niece, every time I tap create account it says that there's been an error making an account, I've tried it on other devices and still the same pop-up comes up!!! I would have given a good rating if this didn't happen please fix this I want to keep in contact with my niece.",
"It really is a safe kids app. I have had this since I was 11 and now I'm 13, it still does me good! If someone wants to add you, they have to put your code in and if they don't know the code, they search you up but it goes to their parents/guardians. You can call, message and send things to family and friends, it's truely so helpful because I can talk to my family and friends because they might not have other useful platforms to chat. Thanks message kids x",
I really like the concept of the app..i have had the app on my phone with all 4 of my kids on it and for 2 weeks now and in the last 3 days its not wanting to open up or when i get it opened all the conacts on one of the accounts isnt wanting to show up! Id like this problem fixed cause my kids really enjoy the app...and it keeps them in connact with family and friends we dont see often..,
"It's so cool and totally a cute way for my daughter to connect with her 6 grandparents. I'm totally in control over who can talk to her, how often and how the see her. She feels in control but is not. I love how you can have 2 parents seeing all activity she is doing. Finally a kids app I can get on board with.",
I downloaded it on my cell phone and it worked but the main reason for wanting it was to get my kid off my phone.. So we downloaded it on her samsung tablet and it wont even open... Click on the app it goes to a black screen like its about to turn on and then just goes right back to my homescreen... uninstalled and reinstalled and still the same thing..... if i could give it no stars i would,
"its a good app! but there is a major problem that makes me wanna smash my ipad, so at the home screen, i try to call. i try multiple times, and it says shes on. i try to text her but it says,"" Unable to send."" i even said, ""UHH WHY."" you know, i thought that would work. still, not working. i dont know what this error, are glitch is, but please fix it. if you do, i will change it back to 5 stars.",
"I have had this app for 4 years now maybe a bit more, and It has a alot of complications. With Voicemails videos, and now it won't even allow me to sign me back in. There's too many problems with it Honestly.",
"Very disappointing, my kids are locked out of their accounts and cannot get back in. I've gone through the log in steps many times, I've even changed my password. My kids use the app to speak with cousins. Very upsetting to them since they don't get to see each other often.",
Would give it -5 stars if i could. App doesnt even work. Everytime you try to login it instantly returns you back to the login screen. I thought maybe it was our devices (fold 3 & galaxy s9) but based off other reviews this app is just pure garbage with lazy dev's who wont address the issue.,
"If I could give 0 stars I most definitely would. It worked fine until recently. I go to authorize my account as the guardian and it keeps looping me back no matter how I try and log in. Extremely frustrating, especially for my daughter who likes to chat with her friends and family.",
If so many people have left reviews complaining about this app not allowing them to sign their child in or create them an account why hasn't anything been done to fix the issue by now? We've never had an issue until my daughter got a new device and we had to login to her account for that new device. NOPE! Just not letting us in and my girl is very disappointed as that is how she communicates with her Dad and step Mom when she's with me. FIX THE ISSUE FACEBOOK! It really can't be that hard!,
"Us parents need more options for parental control. Also, how is it that my daughter can send me GIFs, but I'm not able to send any to her? Please fix this. The video call quality is also terrible, even with a good connection. Otherwise, it's a good app.",
I think its a safe app. It Is pretty good I just don't like some of the controls. Example. For your profile picture you can't choose one from your gallery. You have to take one on the spot.,
"Ok,I have the update it's Awesome. But there needs to be more colors for you to customize you text. Also I feel bad whenever I accidentally call some one, so when you swipe there ""tag"" (I can't think of what there called) make it say do you want to call (name) Ok thanks Byeeeeeeee. üòú Also there's been small glitches.",
"We love the app, but for some reason it doesn't let me log into my kids messengers anymore. The error message says that this user is not allowed to log into this app. I would really appreciate assistance with that, since this is how my kids are staying in touch with the friends who are far away",
"This app is good overall. It's nice that my phone isn't hijacked at all times by little people! It's disappointing though that the games that are on adult messenger which cater to kids are not on the kids messenger app. That should change. As an adult I really have little desire to catch donuts in my mouth. Also as another parent mentioned, we need more access to what our kids are doing within our app. Thanks for taking the time to put this app together. I'm sure improvements will be made.",
"The app is great. You have to remember that to use controls on the children's app, you have to go through your Facebook. Press the 3 lines in the top right corner and it's gonna pop up your children's messenger. That's where you're gonna control their app from.",
"actually I really like this app, well to start off its amazing for our kids to connect with their friends. for some reason when I tried to log in I entered the correct username for Facebook and the correct passsword but it said no internet available and in pretty sure there was enough internet.",
"Hi, I love Messenger Kids a lot! Some of my friends don't have phone numbers yet, (me either) so it's nice to beable to intall an app like Messenger. The only thing is, I wish it had more games. So, if you have a chance, please make more games. Also, I love that Mesenger Kids added Would you Rather questions that I can send! I really like that!! And I also love that you can do funny filters in calls! I would problay rate this fun app a 4 star rating! Thank you so much, I love this app.",
"On Chromebook the ui is cropped and the close button can be inaccessable at times. In photo mode, the filters continually scroll making it unusable. When the screen is folded back in tablet mode, the filters stop scrolling and everything is normal.",
"I love this app to stay connected and more. There is one thing im upset about it though. The messager app has more featurs such as green screen and more filters, etc. If you could atleast add green screen filter thay would be great.",
"I love the app. It's a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. But the ""unable to send"" bug needs to be fixed, immediatly. It is getting on my nerves and i rly need to text my best friend. Thats why im giving it 3 stars.",
For this app I cannot change my profile picture. And my picture always comes out blurry and when I get a good photo and change it it says can't upload photo. And I can't even go to my own gallery to chose a photo to use. But it is still a good app to message people other than the profile picture confusion.,
"Awful controls. I have to have the app installed on my phone to access the parental controls. This means every time one of her friends calls MY phone rings. I have notifications turned off and this stops the message alert, but no way to stop the incoming call alert. I going to disappoint my kid and cancel her account.",
APP doesn't work. Downloaded and redownloaded. App continues to go back to parental verification screen. Literally typed in the information 10 times in a row and nothing. Would be nice if my child could actually use the app. Just saw numerous reviews with this same issue written within the last 3 days. FIX THE APP,
"My daughter got a new device because her tablet quit working. Now I can't log into her existing account after I download the app (there is no option to log into an existing account, only to create a new one or invite people). I can't create a new account for her, it won't let me do that either. If her account is inactive for too long Facebook will delete her account, if that happens I will not be able to create a new one. Very disappointing.",
"This app is very useful, it's quick to send and the design options are great. I wish there was a dark mode but that's fine. Although, It constantly switches my account without me saying to.",
Things happen in life and sometimes you need another way to get in touch with your children other than cellular service. I added the app on my daughter's phone and when she's on wifi I can call and video chat especially when there's an emergency. I determine who can communicate her with too. Thank you. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,
You can text and call your friends and There is no money needed. I love it so much and when you send something it tells you when then have seen it. It is so fast at sending messages. I love calling my friends and playing with the filters in it. You really should download it.,
I like this and all but my friends can put background music on their videos but I can't because one of my friends sent me a video and she showed me how she did it but for the options for me I didn't have it so can you please make it where everyone can do the same things. Thanks and sometimes for no reason I can't watch my videos or others videos and it the with photos on here please fix it,
THIS IS THE BEST APP!!! I would recommend to all of the fun activities you can do and you can have filters which is very fun!!! The only thing I don't like is how there's no more of the piggy game:( can you please bring it back I love that game it the best!!! And can you bring the other ones back. :),
"I find the fact that KIDS CAN POST & FORWARD VIDEOS that CAN NOT BE DELETED by the parents absolutely TERRIBLE!!! They do not know the danger of that. The problem is that by the time a parent (my husband and myself) find out about it it's too late! This MUST CHANGE!!! Facebook you are responsible for this, Fix it! Kids are kids and still don't know or understand the consequences! As an app for fun communication with family members it's fine. But I am furious that FB is considering adding INSTAGRAM to the kid's suite of offerings. THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!",
Login loop - we have used this app for years and all of a sudden the app has logged me out as a parent and won't let me back in? It keeps going through a loop of authorising the device. I've even tried deleting and re installing. Please help fix this or I will have to remove this from my child's devices.,
"Pretty good app overall, but it is near impossible to press play when someone sends a voice recording. Tap all you want on the play button and it won't play.",
"Love this app BUT you need to make it possible for the parent to DELETE the messages as there is no way for ANYONE to do it yet!!! This needs to be addressed asap! UPDATE: I see no one has addressed this issue yet!!! Can't be that hard to fix.Months worth of messages taking up tons of storage and make it very tasking to read through all of it to try and figure out where you left off. According to all the reviews I've read here,seems no one answers any of the questions or suggestions sent!",
"Was fine, actually great and both me and the kids loved it, but now for whatever reason I can't get in to my parents dashboard anymore to see anything or control anything. It asks for me to sign in and then just keeps looping back to sign in. Will no longer be using this app for the kids since I can't get in to the parents dashboard.",
"Really loved messenger kids. The features are really great. Good way to communicate with my son and he can with friends only after parents approve. We've been using it for few years now. WHEN MY SON CALLS ME OR ANYONE ELSE ITS A HORRIBLE CONNECTION. AUDIO IS HORRIBLE, HAS A DELAY AND REALLY LOAD ECKO. I CAN ONLY HEAR WHAT I SAY ON REPEAT AND REALLY LOUD. ONLY OPTION IS SPEAKER PHONE SO THAT DONT HELP. I really hope this will get fixed, unfortunately we will have to remove the app.",
"I love this app especially when practicing social distancing from her friends & family.I would love to see the time that the messages were sent much like the original Messenger. It's hard to tell when the message was sent üôÇ and being able to nickname, my daughter know some of her family only as Auntie Titi vrs her full name. Adjusting the text size would be helpful. Along with being able to see the full conversation in the parent mode. Group video chat would be amazing given the times. Thanks!",
Was very useful app but i didn't find it easy to set up for myself (adult) to speak with my grandkids. I know how to use most apps but this one is so geared toward kids that I don't think it's easy for an adult to set up for oneself. I actually ended up with an account set up with my grandsons name!,
"Logging issue appears to have been resolved now. Great app, but took over a week to resolve the issue, and I had no response to my support request during that time. Glad it's back, but my thoughts on this app and its support have been impacted permanently.",
this is a good app but what really bugs me is that my messages won't show up and when i try to call it keeps saying that i have unstable network connection even tho my wifi is at full bars and very fast!! and its SUPER laggy and plus it takes long to change your pfp ._.,
Unable to log in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and get stuck in the login stage. I've tried multiple times and it just keeps looping. Generally a good app but now it seems really buggy.,
"App is great! I set up an account for my 9 year old son, for him it works almost completely fine! Though we gave it 4 stars for when he was trying to call a friend it repeatedly hung up. Fix this please, thanks!",
It's a really cool app and my daughter loves it but it's often glitchy and you should have the option to just call and not video chat and it'd be easier if you could make a group chat without all the kids haveing to be friends or whatever it's called in the app but overall it's a good app for Kids and for parents that don't want there kids to have real messager,
It is a really good app my child uses it all the time and plays video games with his friends. But when the new update came out and they reorganized the app my child did not like it. He has been looking up how to change it back to it's old look. Now it looks like just regular messenger.,
"It never lets me know when I have a message when the kids are on it, I get a message 8 hours later or not at all. It will tell me that I am on it though. I already know I'm on! No way to fix it either. There should be a way to fix all these issues when you're on the app, but no way to adjust or fix the problems. I'm still having the same problems, my granddaughter sent me a message 8 days ago. A lot of people have the same problem, but there is NO feedback from kids messenger! No fix either",
"I live this app alot, but on the child's end, there is no way to save the pictures or videos you get sent, I have all the the settings on yet still it doesn't have a way for me to save, please let me know if I'm doing something wrong, if not, please fix!!",
I love this app so much! It works very well. Also I fell more safe because I know my mom moniters everything I do. Also I can only be friends with people my mom approves on her phone. This app works very well too! I can text my friends and family without any problem. I overall recommend this too you!,
It is an amazing app. My mom got if for me when I said my friends had it. I've been using it for 5 years. (Sense I was 10) It is still and amazing app. I now use it for my friends in the country I just moved to. I've seen people right bad reviews but I think it is definitely just their devices. I have it on all my devices and I have not had any issues. Thank you!,
My kids cant even log into this app anymore. We've tried for the last two weeks to log in and it wont let us. We've uninstalled it and reinstalled a dozen times still won't work. It was working for ages now it wont. I put my password in and nothing to authorize my device and still nothing. Even down loaded the recent update and it still wont work says theres an error.,
Can't authorize my new device. Tried several different options with no success. I email support a couple times with no response to my issue. Time to just look for another options. All kid messenger have been removed from all my devices.,
This app is so easy to use for kids and parents!! Messenger kids is a family friendly app.,
I love the funny filters and talking to my friends but it has some gliches and sometimes when I go on calls it restartes and it takes forever to load old videos from you and other friends and it won't let me add other people in a group because they are not friends on the app but they know each other like if two cousions know each other but are not friends I can not add them to the group but it is a good app,
"My sister and I have been trying to get this aaccount application...""messenger kids"" activated on my mom's phone for the past 72 hours. For some reason this irritating app. Is not recognizing my mom's phone or email or Something and we have no idea why. We can get the app imstalled fine. We go and ""create the msgr kids account and we get an error that something went wrong. We have done EVERYTHING correctly. It worked fine on my phone. She has a Galaxy7 is this why its not working????",
"Fun for people who arent ready for a real phone, discord, or texting in general! It's as easy and fun as real texting, but you can't get spammed. The only thing is to make sure ypu have a Facebook account.",
"I am having trouble signing into this app for months, just like everyone else it looks like! I have uninstalled, installed & nothing works! I have my little friends sending me messages & I can't respond back! I am beyond frustrated!!!!",
My son loves it. I love it because he can call me when he's at his dad's and he can call his dad when he's with me also he can call his other siblings whenever he wants and doesn't need to ask anyone to use their phone. Just wish you could individually sleep contacts so he doesnt disturb certain people during certain times.,
"Well, when ever I call somebody my screen turns black so if does not shoe my face 2. It's sooo laggy and the messages don't go threw all the way so they take like a day to load! 3. Whenever me and friends are on phone then we go play a video game if hangs up on us like 2 minutes while we are playing! This has never happened before. 4. Messenger fix this issue.",
"The overall app is very fun. I love the filters! I would give 4.5 stars, but it won't let me. The only thing I don't like is that on Android, I can't make my profile picture a picture from my gallery. Oh, and the GIFS are very dry, and limited.",
It won't let me log in to my children's account and it keeps asking for my adult verification but never allows me to put it in. It keeps looping around and around and around. We haven't been able to use the app for several days. This issue needs to be fixed.,
"Ridiculous that this login issue has been present for over a week with no kind of official response from Facebook support through any channel I can think of. I've messaged them on Facebook messenger, commented on their Facebook page, DM'd them on Twitter, emailed the developer email listed on the Play Store, submitted feedback through the app, and have so far received not a single reply let alone an explanation.",
I love this app. I've been using it for almost a month now and I absulostly love it! I can connect with my loved ones and even people I haven't seen in a while! This is personal but my Grandma passed away on New Years Day but I texted her on this app and I miss her so much but I was able to text her a couple times in the end. <3 Get this app!,
"I lived overseas for three years because my husband is active duty military, and when we moved back to the states I installed this app for my daughter to use. I was shown the EU privacy rules and regulations even though I am in the US now, and it does not allow me to add my child. Facebook needs to find a better way like Google to determine location. I have no way of fixing this error, there is no one to call or email. It is infuriating to have no way to fix this.",
"I must say that this is one of my favorite Apps! My Granddaughters, Husband and I are able to call us and do Facetime for an hour #withoutinterruption! I wish that I could do that with my other family members that are not parents. Even my Facebook Messenger App won't work correctly most of the time!!! At least they got it right with this one! I highly reccomend this App to all Grandchildren and Grandparents!",
"l like messenger kids, and i think it is great, because you can call your friends and text them, you can also take funny photos, draw, achieve missions, and grow a cute pet, l also think it is a very friendly environment for kids, like me. l totally recommend the app messenger kids!",
"Why out of nowhere was my daughter locked out of her account? She does not have a cell phone and I communicate with her through messenger kids on her tablet. I have tried to authorize her tablet and my phone, but it keeps looping back to password page. Gets no further. This is frustrating! Are you planning on fixing this or should we move on?!",
"This is a great way for a child to connect with friends/family with parent consent. Set up was a little confusing tho since it asks for parent facebook friends then friends, so we ended up requesting both ways. Gave it 4 STARS because there aren't any DATE/TIME stamps. PLEASE ADD for parents to track. I have no idea what day child sends or calls. Or if she's doing when she shouldn't. Parent can set boundaries in app, but I want to see these to track how responsible she is & have access when need",
I love this app I use to have to wait to see my friends to talk to them but now I can talk to them anywhere anytime anyplace and they love it too when my mom found the app I was so excited because I use to not talk to my friends a lot because of school. So thanks for everyone that put hard work into this for kids like me to talk to people. Have a great day and don't work to hard!üòÇ,
"I like to contact my friends and family through this app. But sadly the new update has changed my appreciation for kids messenger. When you change the color by clicking on your profile picture and then clicking on ""decorate your app"" I taped the color orange and then it didn't change the word bubbles from when you text someone. The new update has also changed the contacts from squares with the color that you changed on ""decorate your app"" to rectangles with no color. Thats kids messenger. )=",
"There should be a separate Facebook for kids too, so they can interact more with each other. The messenger app is good but the notifications that I turn off ends up back on again and is a big interpretation.",
"It wouldn't let me sign in, terrible. Please fix and when you do, everytime I send alot of photos and videos at the same time it gets the chat really glitchy. FIX ALL PLEASE. I might change my rating.",
"Wireless earbuds won't connect to this application. Nothing is wrong with the earbuds, they work great with ALL other apps but this one. Why? My kids have to have 2 different sets of earphones now. Extremely frustrating.",
the app is nice especially during this pandemic for my kids to stay in touch with friends and family but it needs an auto rotate patch so they can use their adapted keyboards that turns the tablet into a mini laptop. The messenger for kids does not auto rotate like all their other apps do.,
Love this app because I can keep an eye on who my kids are talking to and yet they can still msg family nearby and relatives we don't get to see often because of the distance between us!! Love how it informs me when someone msgs my kids! Also my daughter blocked her sister cause they were aggravating one another and it informed me of that as well. I highly recommend this app if you have kids that are starting to get to that age of wanting to be involved in the not so good social world these days,
I LOVE THIS APP!! It is a vey good app for kids and how they can learn about how you have to be careful online and that you can block and unblock people!! I also love that you can accept friends not just they become your friend! ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! It is very safe and i suggest you get it!!,
"One change I would like to see. I should be able to check my child's messages from my phone so I can monitor better. All other parental controls are good. The app is great! My daughter loves it, would highly recommend!",
"It's a good app but different things work on different devices.Like for example some of the games only work on apple products using ios.Or that on a phone you have more options to do things than on a tablet.You can also do filters on the app,It's supposed to add new filters every week but for some reason sometimes my freinds have to wait three weeks to get the same filters that I get in a week.Sometimes I have to wait.It's the same messenger kids for everybody so everyone should have it equal:(",
Very happy with this app! I can monitor my children and what they are saying and being told by the other person! Which I love the fact I have to approve the person before they can talk to them!!! If anything it could be more exciting for the kids... like snapchat tiktot etc. Just add some fun to it for them!,
"I might have liked this, however, I didn't get to try it because their validation is through Facebook and my Facebook doesn't work. I really wanted to give you guys 5 stars, but I suppose the Facebook thing isn't your problem. However, not everyone has a Facebook account. I really hope you guys fix this. There have got to be other ways to confirm that i am a parent and not a stalker.",
"Normal messenger allowed you to change a person's name to a nickname. For instance I would like to change their grandparents to ""Grandma"" and ""Grandad"" so it's easy for the kids to see who they are talking to. Also, are all the notifications on the parental divice necessary? I've chosen who I trust them to talk to and msg with but don't need to see every msg or call, as they are with trusted people. Maybe if the app allowed us to go in and check a notification bar instead",
"I have it on another electronic, and it works fine, it just asked for my Facebook password. but then on my IOS is asks for an email or phone number, and when I enter what's correct, it says it cant find that account. please fix! other than that, the app works great in other device.",
"I think messenger is a really good way to message people you love or that your friends with while the corona virus! Its really fun because you can talk to everyone of your friends that use it! Also if somebody does a friend request when you don't know them, it will go to your parents phone before it goes to you.",
"So far, so good. I love this, the filters are fun. The only problem for me here is, when I click that one filter (the black mouse with round glasses filter) in the taking a picture button , it will send me back to the main screen. Anyone else here agree? Or is this just me?",
"This is a great kid friendly app but I have a few issues, first of all sometimes when im messaging or calling someone it just completely closes the app and second of all my filters will just disappear and I will only have 3 or 4 and I don't think my my device is the problem because many other people have complained about this.",
"i love this app alot! its very safe and allows my mom to supervise me and i can text anybody i want. with my moms permission of course. though, sadly i am experiencing an issue, it wont let me sent pictures, when i do, it shows it for a few seconds, and then it just disappears. if anybody could give me advise on how to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated.overall this app is a safe app and i would advise it to anyone. -thanks",
The only prodlem I have with this app is that it does not tell you when you need an update for it.Kid's might not know why it is not working for them.Also how do you change your text bubble to a deffrent cloer it was esay on the old update. Did they get rid of it. If you did can you please add it back. Thank you,
"Love this app. It's great4the kids2talk with friends&family when so far away or due2the pandemic2catch up while social distancing&still see some smiling faces. This app is connected through FB but kids don't have the direct access2FB. The parents can see all messages, pictures/videos sent or received&can see all actions by the kids linked2the parents FB account. I LOVE IT! I dont monitor all the time2give privacy/trust, but randomly from time2time one click away away2look if you feel the need to",
"App is great for kids BUT all of a sudden the sleep setting won't load for me anymore and I can't set it. My daughter gets vid chats at ALL hours of the day from her friends and no matter what I tell them, they don't stop!! I need this setting to work again. Please!!!",
"I absolutely love using the app. I have 3 pre-teen girls and we've in Ohio and I have family that live up in Minnesota. Having Facebook Messenger for my kids is a huge blessing. Mybkidsbare able to now keep in touch with their grandparents up in Minnesota. Having the complete control on making sure my kids are staying safe is important to me. I love it, I absolutely recommend cause the app runs off of OUR Facebook accounts.",
"Okay so, every time I'm on call with my friends, whenever I hover above my camera , (I have an android) it always makes my screen go black until I stop hovering above it, this is really annoying (I know that it's the app because it never happens when I'm not on call) please fix this bug.",
"This app WAS great until a week ago. Same issue as so many people. Its booted me back to the parent login page but it won't let me login for any of my kids. I tried uninstalling and reinstall both Facebook and kids messenger, cleared cache and data, reset password. Nothing works. Would be great to get this fixed!",
I installed this app wo my child could speak to family that lives far away but the app does not send her notifications at all when she has a message. I have checked this out while sitting beside her. This is very useless if they are not receiving any notifications that they even have a message.,
"Hi I think this is a great ap for kids to connect to friends and I have it and can love it. There are games, filters, even AI pets! I love this so much and I don't fond much flaws so yeah, get this for ur kid if u wnat them to talk to friends, but not random creepy dudes. Just ppl that u approve of. So get this right now for ur kid(s)!!!",
Definitely get the app my daughter loves it and she can you talk to her best friend without having to Ask over and over again and having to Not send funny stickers she loves it so much. She can also go on face time with her friends and she really really likes it. So I definitely Recommend it,
I really love this app it's amazing and rarely lagged. But I hope that u can respond and answer to some of my questions. 1. I think that we should still be able to send messages without wifi. Why can't we? And lastly we can't send a bunch of pictures at once plz help fix that. Thank you‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòäüòÅ,
"The app doesnt recognize anything pertinent when you create an acct for your kid and try to log in. Its like they want to purposely separate you from being able to look over your kids communications. I have a degree in computer networking and various other technical education, so its not an issue of incompetance. Facebook again supports the prevalence of child abuse.",
I love this app it just has quite a few issues and it's hard for my parents to be able to control it. The first issue is that normal messenger users are having a problem sending me links and video so do I. Second issue is I have a tablet not a phone I like the tablet horizontal and it won't turn it drives me crazy and in the calls I can't do the faces unless I stand it like a phone so uncomfortable really u need to fix it cause it's a baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad idea,
This was good for my daughter to introduce her to messaging. I can't say it is the easiest to use as a parent. There are a few things that are not working properly and it's hard to find support for it. I am currently battling the app that says it is sleeping when I have updated the time to use 10x. Getting aggravated.,
"This is my daughter's comment, it's a fun app I like that I can text my friends but there was this really cool filter that me and my friend liked, the cat filter, and they took it away replacing it with a different one that was stupid. Why can't they just add things to the app instead of taking things away? On the other hand this is the adult comment. I really like the security of this app! I choose who my daughter can text and when the app sleeps.",
"This app seems great, but you need to allow separated parents to manage the kid's account (meaning you need to allow the 1st controlling parent to add the other guardian in the control, even if they are NOT friends). This little thing is a nightmare for separated parents because in order to be friends with their child or even manage the account, they need to be fb friends with the other parent and truth is, they generally do not want to. So then one of the parents is penalized.",
"It's an amazing app for kids to talk with their friends and family, but even though I've been updating the app, I still can't get the feature of turning my camera off. I have a Android phone and it still will not work for me but it will for my friends who have the exact same phone as me. Please fix this!",
(I'm a kid) Amazing appüòçüëå! I have a few suggestions that everyone who sees this will agree with#1 I think that you should add it so that you can have the main colour colour any colour you want. #2 Whenever I finish a grow your pet thing it just restarts the previous pet so pls fix thatüòò,
Picture was fairly clear and sounds was good.... When I have an incoming call (even when my ringer is off) the other person can hear it buzz. Other than that I like it.,
This is good but sometimes when I text it says its unable to send. I dont know why it does this but I would like if you would fix it please thank you. Besides that this is awesome. Also can you add more filters and colors too? That would be cool. Thanks and bye,
I hate the app it takes forever to send my messages especially long texts and when people call me when my device is turned off it doesn't tell me that someone calls and I don't like how you can't trun your camera off when you are on the call to everyone who is reading this DON'T GET THE APP IT SUCKS!!!,
Ita a great app! It helped me meet my online firend that lives in another state! The only problem(s) are it has lots of glitches where i cant send messages or the call wont work. Also with the new update i used to have all the filters and games but now i only have 4. It has been getting worse and i liked it better before when this stufff didnr happen.,
"Eventualy you cant text freinds and family, it will say unable to send. You cant send bitmoji, links ect. The calls are glitchy, and if someone on the ""normal"" messenger sends some photos that are grouped together the app will crash.",
"This app I think is a bit Overpertective 1. you can't send sertion emojis. 2. Sometimes it logs you out randomly without you knowing. 3. If someone sends a photo or something from Facebook, sometimes it will say "" Attachment not available "".",
I love this app it is good for ppl that don't have a texting app it is fun and funny I recemend you install it. And when you are in a call you can put a filter on and you can play games. Me and my friend text all the time.,
I gave it a 5 but here are some ideas.... 1. you can't text anyone else when your on a call but the person that you called.2. I wish there was a dark mode to cool my eyes down. 3. when you want to play an online app or something online you can't see them and they can't see you. Thank You! (I am a kid),
Suddenly logged out my kids profiles and now can't log back in. Have changed my Facebook password multiple times and uninstalled and reinstalled the app but just keeps going back to the add Facebook password screen everytime I input it. Now my kids can't use the app. Very frustrating!,
"This is a great app! Glad I found it! The videos and photos I send to my friends are very clear, and not all scratchy and blurry. That's something I struggle with my regular texting app, lol. üëç",
Frustrating and good I like that I can control who my kids talk to. Not a fan of having to be friends with them to add them to my kids. I have family I am not friends with on Facebook but my kids talk to. I dont like that I cant check the time of messages sent or look it up from my account. I think the parent account should have a back door to look at each child account with time stamps and messages. Add those details and 5. Without 3 tops.,
"I have down loaded the app on my phone and on my son's ipad and can not get past the sign in parent part. It will not let me set the rest of the app up. So we have an account but can't use it. Have tried everything, and messaged the app through messenger. Was looking forward to having a safe and reliable way for the kids to contact family and friends üòî",
This app is great but it doesn't work with my BLUETOOTH headphones and it used to work with them and now it doesn't. I would rate this a higher review because it is a really good app. Do you guys think you can figure out why your app doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones? Please I would really appreciate it,
So good it is the best from the kids perspective which this 10 yr old is telling you so messenger kids is about the best app to use for texting family or friends and cool filters and chat and you can play games on a video call and just while texting so I would recommend the dark theme when you get to the controls settings by clicking the profile at the top of the app screen and if I would I would suggest to get it on an iphone I wish you could delete messages you send though that's it so yeah,
"This app is awesome! We have a lot of family who live all over, so its nice that my kids and all their cousins have a way communicate throughout the weeks without needing to ask for a phone or wait till they see eachother next. Only thing i can say id like to see (it may be there i just may not have figured it out yet) is to be able to delete messages from the parent account.",
"Love this. My son has had it for a guess a little over a year now. I have to approve all his friends and can add some myself. He can video message, voice message, and regular instant message on it. He talks to his Aunt, cousins, grandparents, and friends from school. Love this app.",
"Love the idea. My kids only have a tablet - no data so this allows me to chat and talk with them. I hope future updates will fix some of the problems. Installation froze a couple of times. After installation, the app freezes constantly.",
"My daughter has this app on my phone, I look through it when she is done using it and i see all these silly and creative pictures. There are so many cool games. You cn also add friends, family members, and long distance people that you dont see on a daily bases. It brightens my heart when I see or read these funny, cute messges.i hope more people will download this app. I think it is a great source for kid 6+up. That is why I rate this app a 5 out of 5. I hope you enjoy this app!",
"Not getting notifications when messages come in. Have checked notification settings, cleared cache & data, uninstalled, reinstalled. Still no notifications. Also, it would be nice if Iive video chats could be backed up to a cloud so parents can review if needed.",
Great for me don't have ads,
"I love this app, I just wish you could send gifs",
My son always wanted a phone so he could talk to his friends. Then I got him messenger kids and he loves it,
GREAT but it wouldn't let me change the person's photos not my photo it's the person photo,
its amazing for kids to talk on,
It is really fun and you get to call people that you Love,
love the app but could not hear my friend when we caled,
"bro I swear i try to create account for a kid and there's a error saying ""Something went wrong creating child account""",
I give it 1 out of 5 becos i cant even get in becos it is asking for facebook when i dont have facebook pls change it to just phone number‚ñ∂:(,
"Good application, suitable for kids",
I like messenger kids but when I want to create a group it shows like a pitch white square üò°,
It works you can call people and your friends but you need accou,
"Sometimes when my hand is like 7"" away from the the camera it will go black",
Very good app & user friendly,
Honestly it's a good messaging app for kids (like me) but I have a few problems that need addressed which mostly is with the color themes and how it doesn't work on android but works on iPhones but just bring back the original themes. Ok but also there is that the camera sometimes won't work even if you turn it on and sometimes I can't here people via call but overall I highly recommend,
"Exactly like Jenna O'brien, I find the exactly problem when I try to login into the app. It not let me login with the correct Facebook password. It's back to the login page and ask me again for the password, again and again. So my kids can't use it. I already uninstall and reinstall but still the same. Please fiz the problem so my kids can chat with her friends.",
Love it. Just wished it would let me add a theme to their profile,
"I rated the part about ads in the app 5 stars bcuz THERE ARE NO ADS! Ive been waiting forever4something like this2be created! Ive been trying4years2 figure out how2allow my kids2communicate w/me when they arent w/me w/o having2buy them their own phone before they R even old enough2drive or b4they have graduated elementary school! This is great, wonderful, easy2navigate, easy for kids to use&adults! It has alot of features&the parent IS REALLY IN CONTROL!",
Great game to talk to ur friends,
"Horrid. I loved it at first but we added a new friend and then it shut down and asked for my info, which I entered. However just like everyone else said, its in a loop where i'm adding the info over and over with out anything happening. FB and Meta is too big for lil stupid things like this to happen and they not try to correct it.",
"This is so fun! i'm 11 and I love this. its easy to communicate on, and super fun with all the kid-friendly things like filters on calls. It is also good because my parents will allow me to text my friends because they can see what we send. I probably wouldn't be able to use it without that feature.",
"When I first downloaded this app for my kid, she was having so much fun. But one day it logged her out of the account and can't get back in. We created a new account still nothing worked. I can't remember my Facebook password and I can't get her logged into her new account or old account. Please fix this",
only problems I have are 1) its not compatible with one of our tablets and we have two kids with tablets. 2) The kids can try to call people whenever they want. Which means people are being bothered by it. So stay by your kids at all times so they can't or you'll have to uninstall it lol. 3) Sometimes it doesn't want to log in so I'll have to exit out of their profile to the adult profile to exit out of the program. Then I'll have to go back to their profile to go back on and try again.,
I canr change my favorite color ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ Also great app,
Can't log in keeps putting me in a loop to authorise my device. I've done this. Can't get a reply on how to fix it. Kids would like to talk to their friends over the school holidays but cant cause your stupid app wont let us in... FIX THIS!!!! Looks like it's been happening for weeks reading other reviews.,
"This is a great app for young children to safely stay connected with friends and family. The only complaint I have is the lack of control over notifications. I should be able to control the notifications. Especially the notifications that people are online! My children doesn't need to learn this early to run to the phone every time it dings. And, they shouldn't be set up to get excited that they're getting a message from a friend just to find out that they're not.",
"App downloads but when I try to create a account it says there is a failure with creating it. I have tried reinstalling, and tried creating a account with no success. If someone knows why it may be doing it or a way to help PLEASE let me know cus its important I get this app to speak with my neice. Thanks.",
"Really? all of facebook messenger outlets work on andriod except this one? my kid has a chromebook,and no phone. Such a bummer that it worked a month ago and then with the new update it doesnt even work at all? And i cant even uninstall it now. She will get notifications still from the app but is unable to open or respond to any messages. What a BUMMER If all of the other messengers work for this chromebook, why wont this one. Doesn't make sense. Please fix.",
Ii Wont let me text at all pls fix this thank you,
I've had this app for my son for a few years and never really had any problems with it. Love the concept that I have control over it too. But I just got my son a phone and tried downloading the app on the phone but for some reason it will not let me login. I've tried everything. So then I logged him out of it from his tablet and now I can't even get back on it on there. He's pretty upset about it because it's the only way he can talk to his bff. Please fix this! Thank you!,
"I can not tell you how much I hate this app!!!NEVER GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ok, I am going to list all the bad things that happen sorry but this will be a long paragraph.1 every time you call someone you can here yourself and it makes it hard to hear what the other person is saying number 2when you text someone it dosent send and after thirty minutes the other per son maybe has two or three texts (yes that is how bad it is)üòënumber 3 every single time you call someone it hangs fix this",
"Have uninstalled. This app is a complete waste of time. If I could give it zero starts I would. Will not let us log in. Asks me to verify, then logs out over and over again. Please fix this issue. Tried on several devices, all have the same issue. I can see by comments that this is affecting more than just my household.",
"The app is not letting me take a profile picture in selfie mode. It also does not give the option of choosing a pic from the gallery. It works fine on iPad, but not on Samsung tablet. please fix this issue. Otherwise, this app would get a 5 star.",
"My kid used this app just fine for a while and then suddenly her account was deleted and it won't allow me to recover it. I have since tried several times across several devices over the past YEAR to create a new account for her but it always gives us errors so we have been unable to use it throughout the pandemic, the time we needed it most. Facebook refuses to even acknowledge the issue.",
This app is a very good app! Cause you still get to do some of the same stuff you do on the adult one! But the thing I don't like is that when you get a message the person's profile pic does not show up when you get a text. Can you plz fix that? But over all its a very very good app!,
"Its great you can talk to your friends and mom and dad! And you can't just call.... you text messages!!! ü§óAnd video, photos and voice messages! And lots of games to play and take a picture of your score!!!But you can have faces to make your photo and... well somtimes they disappear to add more faces. But anyway it is very fun!!! And also if messenger kids wasn't here i wouldn't get to see my friend so thank youall of you createing such a good and fun app.üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò",
It's a real cool app with games and lots more,
"I'm very disappointed, as of today August 26th 2023 my favorite filter was removed i was just using it this morning before, at 9PM The filter disappeared I have had many good laughs with it now I'm mourning the loss of my favorite filter and I can't find it anywhere else, Almost feels like my life has no more meaning, Please bring the filter back, it was the only filter that made you have a big face and funny deep voice.",
Wish You Could Choose To Take A Picture Or Use A Picture In Your Gallery For Profile Pictures Besides That Good App Almost Flawless . EDIT: My Child Can't Get Back Into Her Account & Error Every Time You Try To Create A New One So .. It Sucks !,
"So awesome, I can talk to my friend in Florida without having to get Facebook, its so cool! There are fun filters when you call and games to play when you text. And your parent can see what you send and messages you receive! I love this app and definitely suggest it :)",
"My child logged in and it kept her logged in but today it logged her out and I have to authorize her device to log her in again but I need to be able to contact her. Also, she tried to change her profile photo on our internet that is strong enough to video chat on, and it said : Oops! Something went wrong! No internet... Please fix this glitch. Otherwise, it is a well made app that helps me access and contact her.",
It's great my kids love it. I can see what she's doing on there and I can add her friends so she can chat some more. I can even video call her too! It's a wonderful app. You can change the colour of your text bubble and it even has some fun educational games.,
my friends talk in the summer whaen in school thank you for making this app,
It's so cool my kid can talk to her friends and me. And setting up the app was so easy because you just hook it up to your Facebook. Parents can pick the people that your kid can talk to. My kid says they don't have good fillers like they have only a few fillers but I still love the app.,
"Trying to create a new account for my other kid and it keeps giving me an error. It won't recognize that my account exists on fb and then when I force it to find me by doing the ""having trouble"" login it lets me start to set up the new account but when I go to accept terms and services it just keeps saying theres a problem.",
This is the best! I love the filters and games you can play! I do this iwth my friedns all the time and they love it too! I reccommend this game to anyone who needs doesn't have snapchat! It is fun and you can record yourself while doing daily challenges!,
"If I could give it a ZERO I would....It keeps logging my kid out. When I try to log her back in, it says get a grown up for help. I enter all of my info to verify her account, then enter the code they send. Then it just repeatedly cycles & says temporarily unavailable!! Pure stupidity. I have unistalled/reinstalled the app multiple times & it will not work.",
"My kids and I really love this app! Being military and living overseas prevents them from using the app though. We keep getting this ""app not available in the region"" message when we try to log on. Its the whole reason we got it so they could keep in contact with their friends everywhere. If my FB messenger works everywhere, why can't their kids messenger do the same? If not for that, definitely 5 stars.",
"I don't see much wrong with it! It's a safe app for kid's any age to use! Your parent can see who you block, what you message and when you want to make a new contact you must get approval from your guardian. I reccomend. However: I have 2 issues. 1: When using filters, it get's really laggy and 2: If your parent dosen't have facebook you can't use the app. I suggest making other apps connected eg. Instagram, whatsapp or just there simple phone number. Overall a great app! I totally reccomend! :)",
"There is this bug where you have to press the bar to type and it only shiws up one letter, then u have to click it again, which is super annoying. FIX THIS. But overall pretty good app.",
"Tried to load it and when I had to scroll to find parent it sent a request to a complete stranger when I scrolled and wouldn't let me undo it. Deleted app straight away. Simple thing so be remedied and I'll not use it ever until it is because I don't want an accident like that meaning someone can be connected my child's account. Sure, could have gone through and manually removed them perhaps but I did not want to waste anymore time on this to find out.",
"This app is pretty good. Lots of my friends are on it so it's a good texting app. I have one complaint tho. It not abt glitches tho. I feel kinda weird with my parents sometimes watching me text. And no I'm not rude and I most definitely dont swear, but I just want it to be me and my friends. I'm like not 8.",
"I love that my child can contact his friends and family. The program is great and has games to play. You can also monitor who they talk to, who is added, what is share in conversation, and the app does not allow content to be shared that is not age appropriate. Love it!",
It has been absolutley amazing and there has been no issues what so ever. messenger kids is an amazing way for me to conmect to my friends and family members that live far away. This app is amazing and i do recommend downloading this app for you kids so thet can connect with all of there friends and family around the world.,
I Love the app. Just a little glitch. So it keeps on glitching me out and won't let me play and just keeps on restarting the app over and over again! Please fix the bug it also happend to my friend! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†,
"I would absolutely recommend normal messenger-like features, like name changing in groups and chat colors, including many other things that I can't fit in this text box, and I still want messenger... *voice trails off*",
it was a little confusing for me at first. But once I figured it out I have had no problems. my boys love video calling each other and making silly faces with all the extra Editions. it has been very reliable for me so far which is ideal because I use this Messenger to keep in touch with my children.,
"Fix the problem please! Downloaded this app onto my daughter's new phone and it will not go past the log in page. Have tried everything to get it to accept my Facebook password, uninstall/reinstall, change password, restart phone. App still works fine on other devices. It's been 2 days - hurry up!",
"can you please make it where you can send gifs from the keyboard? And not just the selected ones from the app? And please fix the bug where it wont load pictures or not load a video, the screen when you hit play on a sent video just turns black.",
"really like this app. it's nice to allow my kids to message & not be concerned about them!! but could be better if they could upload their own profile picture instead of taking the picture right then. also, it would be awesome if they can download the photos that are sent to them.",
"I would give the app a 4 out of 5 because the one thing i do not like about it is that when ever do a group chat it has to take up so much space with the little bar that says when the group chat started and when it ended but other wise i think it a great app, very kid friendly, and there are some games on it, and you can name the group(s)",
Can you guys make it so u can save videos so I don't have to screen record everytime I want it saved?,
**update** I have not had a notification in the early morning hours in weeks. Every week my phone gets a notification at 5:20 to show me who my kid talked to the most on messenger. I sent the developer a message asking to have that notification sent after 8am. This week I got the notification at 4:40 a.m. I'll be happy to change my star rating when I stop getting woken up early by these notifications.,
It is a great app for kids and I think that it's just really fun and the video chats are amazing and I give this 5 stars because your kids get to have a texting experience so when they get older they'll be like I got this and why the video chats are awesome is because Covid-19 that doesn't let them see each other so the video chat can help them talk to each other while seeing each other and the app is just great!,
"Great when ot works! Was working fine, but now it has logged itself out and won't let you log back in. Says it loading and then logs you out. Ease fix this issue. My daughter really enjoys keeping up with her friends and out of state family.",
Great app but many glitches but the I don't get notifications unless I click on the people so I am on this app and just clicking if I want a reply and the filters don't work very well also why does my child need to ask for promotion for filters she did not have to when we first got the app I have to keep approving it and it does not work pls fix,
"This is a kid: I love this app! I can do group calls with my freinds, call my siblings, call my mom and dad, talk to my best freind, share funny photos, and we used to be able to grow our pet. Me and my freind like to go on scratch, which is a coding website. We can share our most recent creations with each other, and decide which scratchers to follow. It really helps with the school closures, and is a great way to chat!",
"Worst app ever. My daughter had it and it was fine. She accidentally deleted it, and now it doesn't matter what we do, it no longer works. I try to authorize her device and it can't find my fb account. She has several friends that use this app to talk to her and now she can't participate.",
"This is great for monitoring who your child talks to but there are a lot of issues. 1. The time stamps are incorrect for calls. 2. Need to Print conversation history and call log but can not. 3. Child's account keeps getting removed from my Facebook account. 4. I had to reinstall app, so my kids will appear on my Facebook, it does not allow me to log in and authorize my device. It says ""You are trying too often, please try again later."" I've waited 24hrs stil can't log in.",
"You can't confirm to login in. If you like typing your email and password into a useless endless loop then this is the app for you. If you want your child to be able to safely communicate with others.... Well, you literally can't do that with this app at the time being.",
"Well it's great but, lots of key features missing. 1. You cant change the ringtone when someone calls you. 2. You can't get it on PC, only phones and tablets/iPads. 3. You cant cast the screen, which you can do on normal messenger for PC and also mobile, I forgot if you can do it on mobile could. 4. You only get to video call, no normal calls. 5. You cant name other friends or family different names. Good app but missing a LOT of features. Hopefully you could implement them in future updates :)",
"I know that we are supposed to log in but if a kid want to get a app to have fun with there friends they need an email or number!? I was thinking that maybe the app can lower the logging in thing... And you dont have to this, this is just a little thing i dont really like... Other than that amazing app!",
Sometimes it will slow media sharing most the time no. The approving of contacts usually works great but I have one I've arrived for 3 weeks about 10 times and tried from 3 different phones Android and IPhone and for some reason it approved but pips right back up needing approved again I also went online and tried from each phone and It still shows needing approved,
"I like it..... but there are 2 things wrong with this app, first I try to play I game in this... I press it well it don't work. Second, I made a picture well my profile picture. Sooo I took the picture and it said, ""you have no Wi-Fi"" but I had full Wi-Fi and I tried this sooooooooooooooo many times but it aways said the same thing. And by the way all my friends on this app have a profile picture, and they never had no problems with this. one more thing when I call some one I can't stopit",
"I am beyond frustrated with this app. I wish i could give it no stars. I have installed and uninstalled and then reinstalled so many times, but when I go to sign in with my facebook on my childs tablet it comes up with account not found, so i cant even get it all the way set up for my child to even use. So I am done with this app.",
I would give more stars because my daughter loves this app but the last two days my daughter hasn't been able to video chat with anyone on her devices. She's able to answer but can't call anyone. I can't seem to figure out why checked for a update and there isn't one not sure what the issue is but hope to have it fixed soon,
"Messenger kids is a fun and overall easy way for kids to communicate with friends and family! Video calls have a great connection and fun filters to use too! You can customize the app with your Favoret color, and by taking a cool photo! I definetly recommend!",
"My kids love this app but why, for the love of God, when they receive a phone call does it just ring and ring and ring forever. if we're not answering it, we're not answering it! And I know I could decline the call, but when were in the middle of dinner and I'm making a point about ignoring electronic devices having the iPad screaming from the corner of the room for 15 straight minutes is a little annoying",
"A good app for kids i got this for my girls to share and they have made new friends it tell me when someone got my kid's code and i can accept them or decline them. Its a very safe app great filters my kids never seen any glitches or bugs! I recommended this app to my friends they enjoy it for their kids, I tried it a couple times for myself it works well it doesnt all a sudden stop or glitch, its a great app! I recommend this app for your kids.",
I love the app personally for my kids and I just love the app I 100% recomend trying the app. But the one thing that I am mad about is when ever my kids send something it makes a popping sound and it's really annoying. But I also like how you can grow a pet.,
"Rating is based on 2 days of active use (haven't had it any longer as of yet...). Really user friendly, both for patents and children. Very nice parental controls, however, does increase the overall number of facebook messenger alerts... (Yes, they can be silenced as well, but i like to know how my child is using messenger kids overall...at least here in the begining)",
"Experiencing a ""Authenticate Device"" error while trying to finish the setup for my kids' account. The app repeatedly tells me ""No account found"" when I try to enter my email or phone number. I still have yet to find a fix for it, despite research and other efforts Even tried process managing it via my device's settings menu--force stop and reopening the app. Still no luck. Needs an update before I'll enjoy it.",
I like messenger kids. Messenger kids is fun and you can text and video chat with your freinds and family. One thing I don't like about it very much is that you can't get a profile picture from your gallery of photos. But overall it is a great app!,
Love it! Can talk to child through my messenger and downloaded the app to my ipad signed in as her so I can view her conversations as needed. Would only suggest that when kids messenger removes a message as inappropriate and messages the parent they find a way to send the parent the inappropriate! Message cant talk to the child as they suggest if we dont know what was said! That's the reason I gave it 4 stars,
This app has way to many gliches for it to work now,
I have the same issue I cant log in after it logged me out and I keep trying the right password fot the email but it goes past the right page but then flickers goes back to the start and it is a big loop. It doesn't work even though I uninstalled and reinstalled 2 times.,
Amazing all and good to text my friends üíìüôÇ but when I try to call it says can't call or something whenever I send messages sometimes lag‚ï•Ôπè‚ï• but after all it's really great app to msg peaple like anyone but the adding friends this is like ........ I need a code to add peaple when they don't like even have one or smthn,
I created both of my kids an account on each of their ipads and neither of them can open it. It keeps saying create an account or connect with a child on Facebook. Their accounts both say to download the app on their ipads which I did but it gives their ipads the same option that I get. I tried to log out of their accounts and it says neither are signed in. Help!,
I gave my 3 yr old my old phone. Turned on perental controls and added This app. It has made that phone very safe for him to use. I also utilize YouTube kids... and I was able to set the age for his youtube time... love it...so far there hasn't been any adds or inappropriate adds for him to see. Thank God!,
"Its an okay app. The only reason that im not giving it a better amount of stars is because its filters dont fit on very well. It also was really glitchy and whenever theor was a ""good night"" call, you cant do anything thong else and i want to know how to adjust it. Otherwise, its an okay texting app, just please look at these things.",
"This app works terribly with Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra phones. It won't register screen taps during video calls when using effects that call for tapping screen. Have tried it on 2 separate s22 ultra phones now, and neither works.",
I can't delete messages if they didn't send or try and send them again now the person won't leave the top! üòíI also hate that I can't use a existing picture I would like it if it could appeal to high schoolers that don't have social media. And every picture I take for my profile pic won't save to my phone so I have idioticly lost beautiful pictures of me and my siblings üò¢üò≠üò†Would gladly give a 5 star review if the problems are fixed.,
"This app is very well thought out. But I'm only giving it 3 stars because when you want to be friends with one of your friends, you need your parents to be friends. Some kids are BFFs but their parents haven't seen each other. And second of all, when I want to download this app after I uninstalled it, it stops downloading at 99%. I hope this was helpful.",
If you have a phone or tablet you can play it it. Is.the.besti love it and it is so easy I chat with my cousins ALL the time so if you don't want it you AT LEAST have to TRY it it is TO good to not try it just try and like other apps and games there are no adds! There's also games that you can do on a call too .,
"So this app is actually really good but me and my daughter are having 1 problem with it. So my daughter ""accidentally"" logged out of the app and since that happened we could not log back in. Every time I click on her profile it says ""login failed ask a parent for help"". So I keep logging in and it says ""login failed"" . So please meta platforms fix this and I will happily give 5 stars.",
The app is really great. I think some future updates should include getting to set a name for the people you chat with like on facebook mesenger and adding the ability to change the chat theme to like multi color chats or something like that! 0verall a really great app and 10/10 reccomend!!,
It is super glitchy whenever I send a text it makes some people's profile pics default pics. Also I sometimes can't access some of my contacts at the bottom of the list because it cuts it off. Messenger plz fix. ~Zucky is a robot~,
"Works perfectly, except I don't like the feature that u can't update your profile picture. Except that, it a great way to communicate with your family and friends online, but safely",
"Cannot access the app. Similar to other users, I cannot log in to the app. It just keeps looping back to the log in screen. Customer support are silent. No response from Facebook page either.",
Having the same issue as some ppl in here as well. I'm trying to get into my daughter's account to delete a contact she no longer wants in there and I can't get past the log in screen. Super frustrating. Additionally it would be nice to access this through our own accounts....I don't keep it logged Into my phone so I can monitor it because otherwise my phone is blowing up with my kids friends msgs...but I do like to monitor it from time to time to make sure my kids are being respectful...,
"I use this app to communicate with my children, ie if they're home & I want to text them on the way home or from the supermarket; but it's pretty useless when my texts don't get delivered if they not actually using the app at the time I send a message... There's currently a msg I sent 7hrs ago, sitting still undelivered. None of the messages I've sent lately have been delivered without me otherwise telling my children to open the app. Pointless and useless.",
"I am trying to text someone sometimes and then it says unable to send even tho I just text, wyd, and then like for the next hours and hours I can't send a mesage to only that person, no matter how many times I try, please help me someone!",
"My daughter absolutely loves it, but I find it extremely confusing when people request to be her friend and vice versa. The language is written very poorly. I think it should be more self-explanatory for the parents to understand who wants to be friends with her or who she wants to be friends with because it's just not written in simple language. And I'm not really that big into the internet.",
"Edited 8/21/2019 - Disappointed to say that the audio is still extremely poor. Even with the volume on high you can hardly hear each other. -We were excited to try this for our 5 yr old son, as he frequently uses my messenger account to call his grandparents who live quite far away. However the audio quality was poor, people we called could hardly hear us. Filters are fun, but not as many as the regular app. Wish this app performed better as my son loves it for calling Grandma.",
It was a great app in till I logged then it kept looping and looping and it will not let us inüò¢what ever the last update was it messed the app up. Unstalling and re instilling will not do anything I am SO MAD!!!!!!!!!!! I wish it would let me login I hope the next update will fix!!!,
I like the app but for some reason my friends messages and friends disappeared and it won't come back that's why I give 4 star,
"I LOVE this app and it keeps you connected to all of your friends and family. I love how it comes with stickers and GIFs instead of having to download a whole different app. I love the filter a and al, the activities such as filters, grow your pet, and much more.",
I have been looking for a messenger app that sends me permission to my phone (or messenger) Before my child starts a video call. (please let me know if anyone has found an app with a feature like this) Although Its like regular messenger where you can call whenever you like with the exception of only calling between the hours your parent has set. I would like more privacy for the littlest ones who do forget the device on in areas of the house or run straight to mom in the potty,
"Tried to set it up so that my son can talk to his cousins, I got the app downloaded from being invited but it wouldn't let the profiles communicate to eachother and after that when I started trying to make it work again later on it wouldn't let me even log him in and now the app won't even download to my phone, so I'm sure there's alot of cool stuff on there, if the app would work at all",
"Great app to chat with my friends but the problem is that I accidentally logged out or accidentally pressed switched accounts it didn't save my acc ,my moms password doesn't work either she tried the help or trouble it sended a code to her account but it still doesbt work,can you also please create a ""do you wanna switch accounts"" (yes or no button) many people did this so please fix it, pleae3 notice this because this is important.",
"I would have given this app 5 stars if only it had normal voice calling. I want my child to be able to call me on it without HAVING to share video and I don't exactly want her video calling everyone. Other than that, this app is perfect. -edit- My daughter also found that when she video chats with people, normal messenger has a lot more filters than this one and she wanted those. We switched to normal messenger.",
Freezes everytime upon asking for Mic and Camera permission. Frustrating!! Brand new chromebook for my kid and this was one of the apps shes alowed to use,
I've had this app for a while and I've noticed somethings: It's super easy to navigate Fun games you can play Simple layout But here are some of my issues: Cant choose a profile pic from my gallery Sometimes the filters glitches and only shows 1 Cant change the name of others Friend code doesn't always work,
"I installed this app on my daughter's tablet. everything worked fine for about 3 months. After the last update, the app won't load and shuts down as soon as it is launched. Please fix this issue!",
"It will not allow me to connect with my child on messenger. It keeps asking me to create and account for a child, so I try and set up one for my other one, and it keeps telling me error, something went wrong while trying to create the account. But yet my oldest can talk to his grandmother. Grandfather, aunt. But not me. ü•∫ü•∫üò°üò° please help/fix.",
"I love this, the only problem is that when I am looking at a bunch of photos that people send me, it restarts the loading screen and it kicks me out of the call. Still, I call my friends every day on it! 5 starsüòÅ",
YOUR APP IS AWESOME NOW I CAN TALK TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND MY MOM AND DAD WHEN THERE NOT AROUND,
"Cannot login to app (despite it saying Im already logged in on facebook device login) and keeps promtimg me to login OVER and OVER again even though password and everything is correct. Have deleted app and reinstalled,cleared cache, etc. On 4 different devices and same issue!",
I've been using this app for a year or two now this app is great I can communicate with my cousins family and more The thing is in calls ONLY SOMTIMES OK the app crashes other then that its perfect also I love the filters and games and the design of the app needs a change I want something new so change that or to get better reviews give people options if they wanna keep they're design or change it,
I love messenger kids!! I love the fact that I am aware of what my child is doing and that I can control times and days he can be on it. It shows me when he blocks someone so I can talk to him and see why and how to properly resolve the issue. It took me some time sitting down and playing with it to figure it out but not hard at all.,
"The Apps Great, Its one out of four texting apps i use. I dont use it as much as others, cause i usually talk to my friends on my other app cause not lots of them have messenger kids, but he ones that do, i do text with them on this app, the only thing tha bugs me is when i try to do a video call with someone sometimes it stops the call for some reason P.S, i had a account already, and when i try sign in one agan, i cant i have to make a new one, which sucks are on my other on i have",
This app has been a God sent since we have been in iso as it has allowed my 8y/o and her friends to maintain contact in a fun and interactive setting wether through FaceTime playing or just writing to each other. Easy to navigate and use but most of all super fun. Only prob I've had is trying to get my child off itüòÇüòÇ,
I love this app but i want backgrounds like when you call please add this and sometimes it glitches out and you cant see the other person,
Sometimes I try to log in to my account it asks for parents email but after I write the password it says log in failed and I will not let me in my account.,
"You could have a version that isn't as little kidish, it gets tiring as you get older.",
Great app for messaging although I can't send messages to some of my friends right now I won't go through,
"Good but I don't get why u can't just have a proper phone call not just a face time like I get some people want to see there friends but what if u are busy doing some thing well on call it's just rood to turn off your camera, and don't get me started on the fact that u can only block some one and not just take them off your page your parents have to do that like no they don't get to ask 50 questions on why h blocked some like it's none of your business. So u should change that.",
This helps you chat to your friends or your family and even if your friend was in California you can still text them.,
It helps me call my friends and I can text them and it is safe you can ad who ever you want it is the best üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,
Someone help. I was on the app when it told me to pick an account but I was on my account then it told me that something went wrong so now I have to long back into my account but it won't let me go back in!!??,
i kinda dislike cuz the phone version(most phones) has different cooler features but my device and others dont,
This app is amazing as a kid I use it 5p contact my friends and family it's so appropriate and fun definitely recommend,
It doesn't work for my galaxy 21. I used to play games with my son but now it won't let me touch the screen when trying to play games with him.,
"Great serviceüòé, but the video messages are kind of bad qualityüò≠",
this app is good but when i log in its says try again when i tap yes its still dont work and it try again later when it was later it still dont work,
When I use the filters I can't tap to reroll for llamas or any other filter that let's me tap,
"It's good, but everytime I send a link it says ""unable to send"" plz fix",
I love this app but can please fix where the messages come through cuz I don't get my messages or call thank you kids messager,
App will not allow me to setup an account. I keeping getting message that something went wrong. I've tried multiples times and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I can't find any instructions on how to fix it.,
Love the app. I love talking to my friend and family on this app. You can facetime call and even text. It is friend friendly you can text your parents if you do not have a phone or you are always grounded. My parents think it is kid friendly for my and my cousins parents think it kid friendly too. My rateing is a 5. LOVE THIS APP! You can do everything it even has fliters that you can use to send to the people that you like to talk to. You can talk to them when you are not with them. LOVE IT!!!,
"Loved this app for my daughter, when it worked. Got logged out and will not let her back in. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling numerous times. Updating, nothing works. We're both disappointed because she can't talk and video chat with her friends anymore.",
"Haven't even got to use the app yet! Every time I try to make an account, it says there was a problem with creating the account! I've tried this months ago too, and it did the same thing! FIX NOW PLEASE IT'S VERY ANNOYING!!",
"I really like this app. I can talk to my friends and play games and other things BUT...I can not tap or turn my camera off, and I would like to have the egg game back or some new ones so that is my opinion for this app",
It's a cool app. I love being able to talk to the littles that dont have cell phones. But its super annoying that all her notifications come to my phone. I don't see any way to shut them off. So my phone blows up when she is messaging her siblings or cousins.,
"This is a great app for texting and vid calling with family and friends! I love the filters and built-in games. I also love that you can take photo's, videoes, recordings of your voice, ect. I recomend it!",
"My daughter LOVES video chatting with her friends and family, and with this app I don't have to worry about random people messaging her or adult content getting accidently found (gifs) üß°üß° I do recommend, if a child has their own device to only have the actual app on their device because your device goes off when they get notifications if you have the app too. You can see what they're doing on your own normal messenger without having the kids one installed on your phone. 10/10 would recommend!!",
"Its cool but TONS of problems. cant make my pro pic a pic from my galery tho my friends have messenger kids and can nothing to do with version so plz fix. It doesnt let me do stuff like create groups. mysterious things like my texts being deleted out of NOWHERE and parents arnt doing. More bugs. something that gets annoying and can be a problem is a feature to send/receive links. Also with the groups it will say for ex: ""active 11 min ago"" but it doesn't say who and i wud like that fixed.",
"Not happy at all, unable to add any family constant error message stating ""error performing query"" does not allow me to add family from Facebook contact nor will it allow for me to accept their requests. There is absolutely zero APP support of any kind. Don't waste your time. Potential for 5 star if it actually functioned and wasn't a joke.",
"This app was great for messaging my friends. Because of COVID-19 I can't see them at all and messenger kids let me. But it is annoying that I can't use bitmoji. But overall it is a great app, EDIT: There is now a glich were if I am on a filter where you have to tap the screen, I can't. Plz fix",
"I love this app but i only gave it 3 stars because on my computer (the one i'm using rn) it wont show up and it wont let me delete it so i can download it again. But i have a very big complaint,I have been getting bullied non-stop and all it will let me do is block them,at least on my phone and computer,and there has been a lot of swearing even tho this is a children's app. It wont let me send videos from youtube or anything like that,other than tiktok. and my mom is not happy about this. Please fix this.",
Ok great app good for me and kids my age and may be older to use but the call! Is kind of frustrating because when my mom go's to the store and I have to help her bring stuff in she will call me to come out and help but the noise for the call won't come up and it will take forever for whoever is calling me to come up on the screen what if their was an emergency that would be bad oh ya and can you make a thing where you can change the theme on your chat with ALL your friends please fix my issue.,
"My kid loves being able to talk to her friends safely. Trouble is that there are a few adult family members I want her to have access to and even though we're facebook friends, they're not showing up on my list to add them. I'm so frustrated I'm ready to ditch the whole thing. Please help.",
"It is very good but I have 1 little update. When we are gonna take a pic and press gallery, I want to add more pictures than 1, Like, we can put more photos in a single selfie/photo, To be a little more.......Fun? But anyways yeah, Please reply on this so I can see if you guys approve of my request, Thank you!",
"I mean, it's good but not so good. When you want to make a video it's only one minute! Annoying!! But still, apps glitch. But hey, it works! So three starsüòÅ",
This app is amazing for young kids who want to communicate with friends or family without being afraid of some perv trying to connect with them. I have to approve of who they talk to and they aren't seen publically. It's super secure And nice to know my kids are safe while communicating online,
"My children keep in tocuh with their Nana, Dad, Cousins, Aunt's, Uncle's and friend's, During this time with The Virus it's honestly even more convenient to have a way for your children to contact their family and see them, they also have games they can play, so the kids can play games with each other. I also love the fact I can see what she says and keeo control of who she has on her app, it's a lot safer then making your child a Facebook and people being able to look them up and be all weird",
"I wish it will allow us to change the contacts name, for example, by changing Jane Doe to mother or John Doe to father, etc",
"Absolute garbage. It sends requests and calls to myself and there is NO WAY TO FIX IT. Delete the stupid app 10 times and it just remembers eveeything and trust me, there is no way to change it once it is done. GARBAGE",
I would like an option to choose profile picture from the device. Children at my house who has messenger kids on android can only take pictures to put in the profile picture. Also there is no option to off your camera when in a call. That is so disturbing. This app lies very much. It says offline when online and online when offline. Many notification problems like this have been reported in play store and these are huge problems.,
I really think this app is great! But there's one teeny tiny problem... The app won't let me make group chats. üò¢ If I can't make group chats most of my friends and family won't make group chats cuz they don't want to. So please fix this because I really want to talk to two of my friends at a time and I'm the only one who even makes the group chats. TY!!! Oh and can I also get those cool text backgrounds? I did what you asked. I love this app keep up the great work!!!,
"I love this game because for the little kids that have to use parents phones or if you have your own phone. It's like texting in the real texting app, but this one is for kids. When I see my kids on the app texting there family members, it makes me blush to happiness. :)",
"It's a good app for kids, but there are a lot of parent controls and not as many filters and effects as Messenger on Facebook. Overall a great app for when your kids want to text their friends but are too young for all the freedom of messaging.",
"I love how this app is helping my kids stay connected with their friends during the shelter in place. I don't like that the tablet constantly rings when my young son is trying to take a turn playing on the tablet & there is no way to turn it off temporarily or put it on silent. When it has been ringing & you open the tablet the app automatically opens, I don't like that. You can set a sleep mode but ""weekends"" are Friday and Saturday & ""weekdays"" are Sun-Thurs, I need M-F after school hrs.",
"Worst app ever. Used to be awesome! Never lagged, always let me video chat my friends, but then recently I broke my phone, and got a new one. Then the problems started. My mother is the only family member with a Facebook account linked to my messenger kids account. However, we tried signing in with all of the following: her phone number, her email, two very likely passwords, and three one time passwords. It still kept going back to where you put your phone number or email. We're ashamed. üòÆ‚Äçüí®",
Keep getting log in failure I have tried to download it on multiple different devices but I get the same message use to love this app was a great way to stay in contact with my son,
"This app is poor. I am having the same issues as others. It asks for a login and password, when I enter it it goes back to the log in page. Very shoddy. Yes, I even looked for an update, there is none. This needs to be fixed.",
"I love this app! I've had it for like 4 years it's so good, no ads, it's just like Facebook messenger but this one is good for kids! I 100% recommend for kids under the age of 10. But sometimes I can't send messages to friends, but that hasn't happened in like a year or so",
"This is a great app overall, but now whenever I try to make a group, it doesnt load for me or when I try to send a photo or video to multiple people. And when I try to tap when the games it wont respond. But otherwise this app is pretty fun.",
"I think it's great! I'm a kid myself, so of course I'm saying that, but personally, I think some of these comments are kind od unnecessary. It's a cool app that is safe for kids, with a lot of other features that aren't in a normal messaging app. My only request is that it has voicemail.",
"I do enjoy the app as much as my 9yr old does. I do have a problem though, the video chats don't shut off at their designated ""SLEEP"" time. Also I am unable to peek in during their video chats to see whats up. But other than that its been amazing during this time of Self Quarantine.",
"Sad this app doesn't work as well as Facebook messenger video chat. I had my grandkids put this app on their tablets. So they could text and video chat with the family. But the video quality is usually poor. 3 times out of 10. Video freezes, pixelated or stops working all together.",
"I absolutely love this. I love the scaling controls, as she gets older and matures, I can set the levels accordingly. Not only is it allowing me to monitor what's going on. It's teaching her by giving her more freedom as time goes on.",
When I didnt have a phone this made it so easy to text friends and people I knew without having to have a phone and theres so many good stuff i live about this. And you have free calls. And really good stickers it's so amazing and I hope people like it too. So let's celebrate! ü•≥ü§©,
"This is a really great app, it is a perfect app for me to facetime and text my cousins and brothers who don' t have phones yet. So there is really nothing bad for me to say about it...but in the grow your pet tab the current pet is an old ugly disturbing grandpa unlike the first pet which was cute! Could you please try and make the future pets cute....and well not and ugly old disturbing grandpa!",
"I love this app! It is great for my daughter to use. She can chat with her friends on video call and texting! I just have one suggestion, maybe make it so you type in the colors you want not just a few options please.üòäüòäüòä",
"like it üòâ so much fun because it makes your kids see your family friends and it's good for the coved 19 because you can see your friends how lovely is this app rite but I wish the filters and games don't just don't go away so can you fix it so yeah so for now I'm going to say that my kids love it but still I just love the app so amazing your cool, amazing, fantastic, gorgeous, nice and so thortful",
It will not let me login. I haven't been able to login for a couple of weeks now. It won't accept my password and I reset it and even tries the one time password so many times and it. My children have unread messages and want to be connected with family and friends. Please fix this issue.,
Good i love chat with my friends on this it is safe too! You can video chat and play fun games! You can even get an egg with a pet inside!! Level up your pet. But one thing that i am disappointed with the pet game is... that you can't see what it looks like when it is older because it leaves,
"Oh, my gosh, this is the best messaging app, like ever!!! It is very kid friendly, and an amazing thing for kids to text each other, while a parent moniters if it's appropriate!!! It ""uploads"" new things pretty much everyday! It's kind of like snapchat for kids! It also has games in the app too!",
It is a great app. I can talk to my friends when I'm not with them. I love that you can change the color of what you main text boxes. I do think it is save for youngins. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,
This app is very great but sometimes glitches and people can't hear me or I can't hear them and it just causes the whole call and then it ends and it's kind of weird but I'm still reading it five stars because I love this app and my mom got it for me so I can talk with my friends and family whenever I'm at home or their aylin and they're not home and I can talk to them and it's a really great app!,
"I have tried for 15 minutes to get into the app to authorize it, but I keep hitting a login loop. We used to have the app on my child's iPad, but when that kicked the bucket, we tried to put it on the Samsung/Android kids phone. No luck. Fix the authentication loop, Meta!",
"Will NOT let me create an account for my kid.i have emailed multiple times with no response or help. Can't do it on another phone either, so I know it's not just a phone issue. App is updated and everything. So frustrating!",
App sounds don't work... My sound notifications are all on and I get no sound when my son calls or send me a message. All it does is vibrate. And I miss every single call or message which is frustrating.,
Unable to get passed login screen. I've used it previously and it worked great. Downloaded on new device for my child and it just keeps looping back to the login screen and im unable to actually use the messaging service,
"We usually love kids messenger, but now we're having trouble with not being able to logging in as it's constantly logging us out. Have tried to search how to fix the issue and there's no support to do so. Very disappointed because it's a great way for the kids to chat to their friends.",
"My son lost his old phone, we tried installing kids messenger on his new phone and hai entire acct is gone. We tried to make him a new one and cont to get the error message there was a problem trying to create the acct. He's lost all of the pictures he shared in messenger with his friends and now has no way to communicate with his friends when not at school. I've emailed the support and got zero response. Very frustrating for me as a parent and my poor kiddo. Very disappointed üòë",
"Can't create an account and everything that I've found online with people stating the same issue are being told by support that ""it's most likely a terms and services issue"" with no further explanation. Not exactly good support when you send people on a wild goose chase.",
"The sleep mode is glitchy and inconsistent. I have it set to turn off at 3pm yet something it won't turn off for an hour and a half later, or it will be sooner or only if I go in and pay around with it. It has nothing to do with the time zone.",
I love the app but sometimes when me and my friend are on a call it disconnects. Also can you add more color options like light colors or maybe add darker nicer colors. Can you also please add a black it is my favorite color.,
I love that I am able to video chat with my friends and family. This app is an amazing. The fillters are funny. But the only thing that would make the app better is if you could use pictures from your gallery instead of having to take a new one. For your profile pic,
"So far not great! My child can't receive or send messages. Even vidoe calling isn't working. We have installed and uninstalled several times, and tried it on 3 different android devices.",
It was working well but it did not allow me to add contacts. Then it did not allow me to log in. It keeps sending me to the verification part over and over. So frustrating.,
"Very good! I like that this is for kids. Ever since my kids started using this, it totally made them love it! Amazing job! All the bugs that were happening, fixed itself. I really enjoy this, and recommended downloading it!",
So far so good Same layout as regular messenger so it's easy to maneuver as the patent. It does seem to have limited features but ive yet to explore it's entirety.,
Best app ever I can call so many people,
"Can't authorise my daughters account on any device. Asks for adult login and wont progress. Cleared cache, reinstalled on phones and tablet and can't get into kids messenger anywhere. Great start to school holidays with no contact with friends. Asked weeks ago for it to be fixed. FACEBOOK doesn't respond to emails nothing.",
"App is good, good for messaging, group chats and video calling. The only thing I would like is if they could add themes on android devices like they have in iPhones. Other than that, great app! Keep up the good work!",
"The app is okay it could definitely be better, I don't understand how the notifications work, if my daughter isn't using any apps you'll see a notification of an incoming message but while playing any games especially roblox there's no notifications whatsoever. I'm not sure how user friendly this is supposed to be when this is geared towards kids being able to communicate through it. It should notify them regardless of what their doing.",
"I can install the app, but however I can't even sign my 10yr old up, keeps coming up with an error. She is trying to reconnect with some friends from her old school an she can't do that when I can't even be allowed to create an account for her on kids messenger so what is the point in downloading this stupid app, but yet my child wants it. :-/. Fix the errors so I can create an account please -",
It was great till tonight. My son was having trouble with the app not working. So we uninstalled his and reinstalled. Now it wont let us log back in. So we tried mine. Mine was acting strange so i uninstalled mine. Now i cant log back in on my phone. Not sure what to do! Anyone else having trouble?,
"It is difficult to connect with some of my nieces & nephews who use the app even though I am facebiok friends with the parent. I receive a request to connect with the child on messenger kids, then I accept the request and then a subsequent request is sent to the parent for their permission to connect with me. When the parent tries to accept my request after inviting me, it says ""error occurs"". Very frustrating",
I love it but the random code is annoying the filters could be better needs more colors and color modes. It glitches really bad my friend and i were talking and we heard weird voices.,
Usually the app is great but more and more frequently having issues. All of a sudden app won't let me log in. Keeps wanting me to verify my account and loops me around in circle. Please fix this issue for better rating.,
I was really excited to use this app for my daughter. So she can be on our family messages. But it won't let me make her an account. Just keeps telling me something went wrong.... Hopefully this gets fixed so we can make an account.,
overall an awesome idea especially for kids to be able to communicate with others while parents have access to parental control as well.... but would be better if it had all the neat features that actual messenger has.... but other than that such an awesome app and I think it deserves a 5-star rating!!!!,
"This app is great! I'm able to call my friends expect there's one problem. I can no longer hear anything. I have no idea how to fix this, me and my friends tried everything but no luck, please fix this glitch as we would love to chat again.",
I love this app. My kids can keep up with there friends even though they haven't been able to play in person. I can monitor them and I know who there talking to. It's safe and fun. It's a wonderful way to let kids chat and learn this digital world with the saftey of mom and dad close by.üôÇ,
"It's ok I guess, but it NEVER send me notifications anymore. It used too, but now it just doesnt... And plus I don't check the app a lot so I usually have no idea what my friends are saying. Also the grow your pet thing is very laggy... I can't grow it because of the lag.",
"I like this app EXCEPT I don't like that I can't see what's being said. I can only see pictures shared between my child and her friends, which I like, but I wish I could see the conversations as well. I understand giving them their privacy but I feel until they are 14 or so at least, the parents should be able to see the conversations.",
"This app is amazing for kids and family and close friends but the only thing that bug me is that sometimes when I'm trying to text my friends it says ""unable to send"", please fix that and thank you for your time.",
Kids messenger is a very good calling app for little girls and boys I personally love it but sometimes it's really laggy. Antonia says bad about kids messenger is that you have to have Wi-Fi . For that it's really bad because love to bring tablet or phones in the car. Like the play games or talk to her friends anything like that but how can they do that if kids messenger does not work so.,
My dad found it really frustrating that he keeped trying and trying to put his Facebook Email and password in and it just keep sending him in this continuesless loop after he put in the code that the messenger kids app sent him it was really frustrating because alot of my friends can't text on different apps so we tried messenger kids cause that is what we were able to do so i could talk to them and it keep sending us through the infinite loop. My dad was trying for 2 hours. Bad app.,
"*Parent of user* The app works great. We use it for hours to communicate while playing minecraft together from different locations. What needs improvement is no dark theme (only available on ios,) no voice changers (only available on ios,) no ability to change the notification sound, can't send gifs.",
"It has few filter options, so the kid get bored after a few days of using the app. Im not sure, maybe it's the way I set it, but I don't get notification if somebody messaged us thru this app unless I open the app.",
This is a great app its lcool because you can video chat and text with your friends while you dont have a phone number as a kid. So as a kid you can see your friends whenever you want. Sometimes it can be laggy. This is a great app but from mr it gets a four.,
Error- I cannot authorise my kids account. It was working great and now it has just stopped and we can't access their accounts. It just says This user is not authorised to log in. No-one from the help desk actually responds back so good luck if you want to contact anyone for help. No longer can contact my kids while I am not at home.Not happy at the moment!!! Poor service and forget the app my kids cannot contact me or their friends anymore.,
It's nice that your kid can't just add anyone. However they can delete anything the want to and I have no control over video chats at all. That's how they are getting away with things. MAKE IT SO THEY CANT DELETE MESSAGES!! p.s. downloading their info only gives you picture. The text will NOT open,
"I love using this app but, it won't let me text one of my friends. I have tried restarting, force stops and more. I cant even send anything, I can on video call which is very annoying.",
Sometimes when i call my friends the phone does not even ring twice and it says no answer. Its so frustarating!! It does not even give anyone enough time to answer my calls. And it says someone sent a message but when i go to look there is no message. Otherwise i can talk to my friends and family!,
"Update: the login problem is fixed, but now my kid can't send anything. It keeps saying ""unable to send"" when we have good internet and no other outside problems. You guys need to fix this app. We've been using this for years and yet the quality keeps decreased.",
"From my daughter, ""The app is great and all but there are some problems. 1. When I try to play the games it takes so LONG. 2. It doesn't allow me to you all of the filters I want the old app""",
I have used this app on my tablet last year and it worked perfectly but now that I have my phone and want messenger kids on it so I can contact friends it won't let me sign it. The name and birthday work fine but when click create account it doesn't allow me to. Please fix this soon.,
"I personally have issues with my account. It will say my app went to sleep even though I am in broad daylight! I will have to go all the way to he app store, uninstall it three times, and it most likely still does not work. But in the 40% of the time it does work it usually does not let me down",
It's fun and the quality is great üëç,
I really like this app cuz' I can talk to my friends and stuff but I never get notifications and when I'm texting my friend it says 'Unable to send message' and like I had a hard time telling her and i went on two hours later still wouldn't let me type to her if somebody fixed this I will change it to five stars.,
I love the app but i have some things to say. So first when you type in this :) it turn's in to üòä that I'd love if you can fix that. and if we're on this app and we're calling and if we're on another app the screen turns black so i hope you can fix that to. And messenger kids waste a lot of my battery. one time i was at 100 and then it turn to 4 percent of battery. So i think that's it for now so hope you guys fix it thanks,
"It's a great app but, the filters that you need to tap, dont work for some reason. In the past they have worked but now all of a sudden they dont.",
"I am unable to create an account for my child to use the app, after I enter their name and D.O.B. I receive an ""Account creation failure"" message. I have tried to contact support but have not received a reply. I have tried on multiple devices. This app does not work for me.",
This app is the best! 5 star ‚ú®‚≠ê because this app connected to messenger and my kids can video chat me and call me except when they try to send me a picture sometimes it won't let them and I am like what the heck because we have internet and their phones are set up with minutes so I don't understand that but other than that I have no complaints with the app. It is a really good app and I highly recommend it to all parents who don't want their kids to have Snapchat or something like that.,
A MUST HAVE FOR PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. I can see who my daughter adds and blocks I can see who she talks to the most and I can even see what they have been texting about. Now I don't know if I set it up wrong but when her friends call it also rings on my phone but thats a very small price for a peace of mind she finally feels special bc she gets Facebook messenger and I feel comfortable bc I have a clear window to watch everything Said on there. Also there r a few cute games!,
"This app refuses to let me verify my GB account on her tablet. I wiped her tablet clean and reinstalled kids messenger but no matter what I do she can't use it anymore. So one second all good and the next it won't verify me. I've also reached out 3 times through the kids messenger app issue section and nothing. No advise, or help. Cleared cache, uninstall and reinstalled, one time pass code, forgot password. What happened!!? She is more than disappointed to say the least.",
"I love this app. There are fun filters, calls, and texts plus games. I highly recommend it. What I like is you can sent lots of stuff. You can't send the gifs you made, but that is okay. And you can just chat with your friends!",
I love messenger kids u keep contact with everyone u know its a 5 star app,
"Keeps giving the error that the session is timed out...but even with signing out and back in several times, restarting the phone, the app, re installing. Keeps saying that the session is timed out and kicking it back to the log in.",
This appmis great for kids and has amazingly safe and fun interaction with others online. It wilk gove your child the expirience of social media with the option of contact with friends. Everything has to be parent approved before your child friends soemone. This app messenger kids will be fun and safe for your child. I am sure that you will enjoy it along with your kid.,
"More often than not, when I get a call, the app doesn't notify me, I may see it the next day. My grandson called yesterday yet notifications say the last contact was 6 days ago. I've checked all settings and can find no reason for this.",
"I use this app to talk to my younger sister now that I've moved away. But no matter what I try, I rarely get the notifications for her messages. So I'll end up going weeks or months without looking because I don't get the notifications. A fix for this would be greatly appreciated.",
Really like that i cam add who she talks to and can monitor everything...without having to worry about some strangers being on there and that I can set up a time to put the app to sleep so she can't call pr text anyone during inappropriate times.,
Totally Worthless for Overseas Military Families. Tried to setup an account for my daughter but we've lived in Germany for three years and moved back to the US. FB will not let me create an account for my daughter in the US!! No way to contact them. Automated system said we will not be contacted by FB!,
"Can you guys please add a dark mode like on regular messenger, And also on my phone it will not let me choose a profile picture from my gallery. Can you guys please fix this for me. I also would like for you to be able to choose your own contacts without having to go through all of the trouble on your parents phone. Thank you guys so much. Even though these things need to be done I still think the app deserves 4 stars. Thanks for reading and I hope you guys will fix these.",
"I love the app but my mom sets a time for how long i ca use the app for and when the time is up and i can go bake on it i try to text my friends and it says. ""Can not send messing you app is still asleep."" So that is the only bug I see so ya thank you for reading bye!",
"This is a great app! I do have one problem, it constantly kicks me out of video calls. Like, I was on a call and we had to keep calling eachother. Otherwise, awesome!",
"I missed an authentication because the notifications for the kids app is nested in a part of the Facebook app I don't normally use. I activated the account soon realizing that there was already another profile that my ex created. I'm keeping the app active though because there's pictures I took of her before the divorce, and I don't want her to see my account because my profile is only appropriate for adults.",
"My kids love the app and I love the control parents have. However, I was a little disappointed to find that the Kids version does not have the in video call filter games like the original Messenger has. That is my kids favorite thing to do in video calls!",
This is a great app to use for your kids if they want to first time text and stuff. But this is the issues that I think needs to be heard I am able to send gore I didn't know it would be able to be sent in because I thought it would be censered but it wasn't I think there should be something that could check what you are sending. (I'm so sorry if non of what I said makes any sense I'm not good at typing or talking and my grammer is tarrable üòÖ),
"Im using a emulator called bluestacks, But when I press the make account button it says account creation failiure. I have tried reinstalling the app and deleting the data and also trying to do the process all over again It is making me tired and I don't know why or how this is happening, If anybody knows, please tell me.",
"You can chat with your friends enywhere in this app! It is not just for kids! All you have to do is enter a facebook pasward and choose your or your family members friends from facebook, and you can talk and text to them eny time! I love this app! It has no ads and you can have a group chat!",
Amazing no ads thought I wish it will load a tinsin bit faster for the games and my my music videos don't play on my end or the ones my friends send me but it does when they first send it to me like if they send me another video the one before that doesn't play anymore but on y friends send it does play so yeah if you could plz fix that but you should really get it,
Doesn't all u to share location which was the main reason for downloading the app! Other than that it is a fun easy way for kids to play little games with friends and call and text the chosen contacts,
It's amazing for my child. If your child says any curse words it will not be able to be typed. One more is you need to accept who your child adds and you can see who they talk to! I really recommend it!,
Was super excited to get this app so that I can talk to my friends. Got the app and realized that your parent needs a Facebook account. My parents don't feel comfortable having Facebook. Not sure how the actual app is though. Wish you didn't need Facebook for it.,
This app have 2 problem first when my child video call with me and she going to Background for any reason in during video call than kids phone camera off and 2nd problem kids app screen share not visible so parents can't understand child device problem without screen sharing when child say something wrong her devices . Kindly I hope Meta solved this problem latest update.,
Well one of my problems is it does not have a sign in button when you first download the app I cannot sign in as myself the kid- but you can only sign in as an adult which I don't really understand aswell as the app is very glitchy and the messages mostly never come through and it takes about a min for them too send personally I suggest facebook messenger its alot better and the quality is good. The app (messenger kids) also has limited stuff you can do BUT I HIGHLY REQUEST FACEBOOK MESSENGER.,
I downloaded and tried to create a profile and tried many times to go to my daughter's profile and is not working at all. I have 2 kids and I can't access to their account... I hate this app,
"Awesome app for the younger kids in your life to be able to chat with their friends, while keeping them safe and being able to keep an eye on what is going on with them -especially if they are not old enough or trusted enough to have their own FB account!",
"Messenger Kids is just.... Bravo! I don't have any thing bad to say, except the screen turns black sometimes. Otherwise thanks for the application! 5/5 Good Job",
"My friend (I'm only here for her, she can't leave a review) gets calls from someone named Just You. They don't have a profile picture and only her family and really close friends can call her. She has never answered the call, but she's just scared something will happen. Either it's a prank or a hacker.. please help.",
"Good in all ways except one. Sometimes you try to add friends for your kids and it says error and refuses to let you add them... And in this case it won't let me add my husband who is their dad. We got kids messenger so we could communicate with the kids while farming if in different tractors or waiting in a truck... And it won't let me add their dad as a contact for them. Just continuously says ""error"". He isnt the only one,but his is the one that still won't let me add him. So annoying.",
"Same as all the latest reviews, it keeps kicking me back into an endless loop of verifying my account, never letting me log into my child's account on her device. Assuming this is a technical error that needs fixing. Will consider changing rating when it works.",
I am also having trouble on a android device. Logged us out and keeps looping asking for email and password to authorise device. I too have tried everything down to deleting my child's account and creating a new one. Not impressed at all with the lack of communication from the developer.,
I would give this a better review but since ur last update the app logged out and now won't log back in. I have tried everything but won't work on any Android device. Works perfectly fine tho on My IPAD. Lots of people on Facebook page have complained of the same problem and u haven't fixed it. Absolutely terrible,
The video calls are glitches,
"Glitchy. It won't let us log in. I did a factory reset, changed my password, unisnstalled and reinstalled, etc. It just keeps bringing me to the log in page. It's pretty upsetting because now my child cannot communicate with her friends.",
"This app is great for children all ages. I really liked that you can chat with your friends and its real kid friendly. Tho you cant chat or video call if you have no internet, that's what I don't really like. Overall, it's a very good app ‚ò∫",
Fun And I love how you can couler in chat and how it shows you when there typing and shows when there ethir read the mesege or when they have seen it-,
"It's great, but it doesn't let me unfriend anyone as a child. Another thing is it doesn't let me text my friend. She also made a review, same as her review, it's unpleasant, it's been a whole night and day, please fix it! I restarted my phone, shut it down, I don't know what else. Fix it please, thanks",
Love it! Just wish it wasnt always video sometimes i wish you could just call each other instead of always video calling because if were out eating or something then everyone in the restaurant can hear our conversation like were on speaker phone.,
"This app allows kids and adults to communicate with their friends and all that they will have to do is download, and you can add whoever you want too. This app also allows you to send funny pictures and it is like snapchat! More things that you can do is chat and facetime! All kids and adults can get this app and I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do!",
Not sure what happened but all of a sudden I can no longer send my child links which is part of their homeschool. I checked in the settings and there is no option for allowing links anymore. I sent them one on the second of January and today the 10th of January I can't. Please fix this.,
"It's great so far because I could chat with my roblox bff but there's one issue :( when I text it says ""Unable to send"" and it keeps on happening. Please fix it and I will change the rating if you do. Thank you",
"Ok so I would usually do five stars, but all my friends have this thing where you can make these videos with music. I asked them how to get it, but it wasn't showing up on my account. So please fix that because it looks fun and the app is fully updated, so please help :(",
"There's constant glitches happening. You'll try and send a voice memo but it stops and delivers in mid sentence, won't send photos, etc. It's quite annoying.",
Unable to login anymore. Was great when it worked but it logged my child out and now I am unable to log them back in as it just keeps telling me to enter my FB credentials repeatedly to authorise my device and keeps going around in circles each time I enter them.,
"i love it! Since most of my little cousins dont have numbers, I have a chance to communicate with my siblings and cousins. Overall good app. But the pet thing is so glitchy. When me and my sister play it together, it glitchs so much.",
"Hello. Me and my nephew love to use this app. It's easy to use, and I like how you need permission to friend somebody. But my problem is, when my nephew tries to send a goat GIF from his tablet, it says, ""Unable to send."" And when he looks up,""goat"" in the GIFS section, nothing pops up. Please fix this, and I'll give it 5 stars. Thank you!",
"Pretty good app, definitely some glitches. I uninstalled because it was honestly just taking up storage space and I barely ever used it. It would be cool if they could make it like an instagram for kids where you can post and stuff but only your contacts can see",
I love messenger kids. I have so many friends and I can text and video chat them and In the video chat there's filters. You can send funny photos and add stickers on your photos text on your photos you can record a message I just love that app I can never uninstall it I love it way too much.,
This is so fun I love this app is extremely fun I can talk to all of my friends on here I can see them very clearly nothing really glitches half the time it is so cool and most the time you can do little fun little things you can take care of this little pet that shows up in every single time is Christmas or Valentine's Day or any of those it'll be like a different style pet it is so cool I would definitely get this,
"i love this app for my kids. However, I need to report a technical issue with the app and there is no place on the app to do so. I cannot change the profile pic of one of my kids it keeps giving me an error. The camera on the app is also horrible its not clear and you cant upload your own photos for profile pictures.",
love to text my firends on this app.,
"It's a great app. It helped my daughter keep in touch with her best friend during the Pandemic. I would love to see more things added like a variety of games to play with the parents and friends, Also Gifs.",
"It is good but I have a recommendation first I want a chat wallpaper that you can take from your photo library,second that you can have a voice call only too, and when you get a call or a message you can put a ring tone like from a music plat form (Spotify) or a original from the phone , and change people's names and yours too. please consider this and I will give‚≠ê pls pls plsssss",
"Endless login loop that won't let me access my son's account. I input my email and password and it takes me to the same login loop over and over again. Uninstall and reinstall did nothing to help, I'm using hotspot which I'm not sure is affecting the login. My son can't login and it's terrible!!!",
Love it and so does my little one! Their able to stay in touch with family and friends easily. And I have control of their account from my Facebook account which makes it safer for kids to use because not just anyone can message them! Great App!!!,
I like the app but I would like for it to have more 2player games. There is only 2 or 3 games that you can play against your friend. The two options will change sometime I just wish there was more of a variety to chose from.,
"I rarely get notifications from this when I get a message, often times it will glitch and I won't be able to send a message, cant save videos. Find a better app, it's not worth it",
"I mean, It's kinda ridiculous how they don't let them have audio calls or be able to delete messages or have regular emojis but other than that, I really like the app and would recommend for other people.",
I can't log in as a parent in the set up. Whenever I put my info in it just loops back to the beginning instead of moving to the next step. Looks like this is happening to other people to. Very frustrating.,
SO AMAZING! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHAT WITH PEOPLE JUST BY ENTERING A CODE! Just enter a code and boom! You can now chat with another person! It's that easy! There is some ads but they never occur when you are chatting or typing! You can even see when someone sent a message just by CLICKING THE MESSAGE!!!!I rated this five stars for a reason! DOWNLOAD NOW!!!,
"Very disappointed. Can't seem to get past the log in part. Every time I try, it says ""this user is not authorised"" or something along those lines. So I do everything it's asked of me with still no luck. Do you even realise how important this app is for parents? For so many reasons and mine is to stay close with my little boy cus we live in different countries. Not only the parents, it's important to our children too. Please fix this.",
"Was a good app... until it logged my kid out randomly, now cannot access his account. It keeps looping back to authorisation page every time I log in with my Facebook account. I see that there are many other people having the same issue. When will they fix it????",
"I think the app is great but i gave it 4 stars because as a kid myself, i dont want my parents seeing EVERYTHING i text. But towards younger kids and adults its very helpful! I love the cool filters and games and all together i love it!!",
I love it bc it is one of my main uses to contact meh friends but my problem is now it will show I have notifications when I have checked them. I also have to create groups to talk to only one of my friends!!!!!!!I hope they see this review and try to fix it thx!!!!!,
I would rate this app 3/5 stars because it seems really laggy on tablets and or phones. I like that you have a guardian seeing what you type. It also has fun mini games included. You can play single player or play with a pall. I would like to see more customization for the colors and your name. Over all I give this app a 3/5 star rating enjoy!!üòÄ,
"Fire tablet users beware! This won't work for you as of September 2022. Stuck in a login loop despite restarting (multiple times), validating login success on other devices and complete app reinstallation. Remains broken. Please fix ASAP",
"used to be great but logging in is a totally frustrating. my sons acc was logged out twice, 1st time i had trouble logging him in. 2nd time was extremely annoying as it only prompts you to create new acc or download official messnger. we should be able to open the kids account automatically using his facebook but no, we had to log in ourselves and create new account instead of havng the old one. ditching this app. not worth the trouble.",
I love this and all my kids have but any time they try to call someone that person has to call or it won't work the screen or the volume is not loud and they have it all the way up and everything freezes and won't work till i close the app..... but any ways it is a good app for kids and adults and it works from messenger too‚ù§üß°üíõüíöüíôüíúüíñ,
Messenger Kids let's your kids chat with friends and family very safely and fun. Both of my two kids think it's the best app they have on their devices. I definitely rate 10 out of 10 on the app. Awesome app. I let my Kids use it whenever they want. I don't even put sleep mode on it. Deffinetly install it!,
"I had to download messenger kids to be able to talk to my daughter because she's too young for a cell phone, but however it does not show any message notifications on Android phones. So anytime she messages me I do not receive it until I physically open the app and click her name. Not cool at all.",
"In my opinion, out of all kids messaging apps, this app would be the best for kids to chat on. GIFs, custom styled emojis to be made for kids, they can even draw pictures and send them to each other. Really good messaging app for kids overall.",
"I have tried to use this app for my son, for about a week now. I have tried on my own phone as well as my tablet. I verify my facebook, put in his name and birth date then every single time I continue it tells me that an account can't be made. I have reinstalled multiple times, to no avail. This isn't even worth my time anymore!",
"This is so buggy. It asks me to approve the same contacts multiple times. Then I will have a contact set up for my daughter, who shows up on my side, but when she opens her app, that contact isn't there. So frustrating.",
I have thoroughly enjoyed this app up until now for my kids however now my kids cannot sign in and talk to their friends we have tried reauthorizing the device multiple times with no Success I have even reported the problem to Facebook but seems to have gotten nowhere even with the current update it keeps telling us that it's unable to login but all the information is correct.,
"Why can my child suddenly not receive pictures and videos from her contacts? It just started doing that today....I restarted the app, her tablet, checked for an update, nothing! Please fix this! It says '(contact) sent a photo' and then doesn't show the photo or video",
"Works well, but needs some adjustments. Would like to have a parental control to lock out the app from controls. And perhaps a better way to set time limits.",
"My child wanted to chat weith her friends so I got messager kids, and I did all the info but when I went to create her account it said "" Something went wrong"" and when I made a Facebook account for her and everything was fine and I still tried to get her in, but messager kids still said something went wrong it was the latest update so I don't know what would go wrong. It is so frustrating please fix it!!!!!üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤",
"This is a great app but I had it and it worked great but I deleted it bc no one talked to me. But today June 18 2022 I get into it and it creates a Facebook page and it's supposed to be my mom's account but it's not hers. So then we keep trying to get it to work but we just give up and say to just delete it, AGAIN! So I'm frustrated ü•¥ now and won't get messager kids anymore. Maybe it's my phone bc mine is older but idk. Hopefully this app works out for you better than me. Well........ Buh- bye!",
"My kids loved it, good way for them to stay in communication with each other, only problem I have with it only half of the features on it dont work, especially when messanger sends me a message to do stuff and make changes or options no link there's no way to do it.... just like this one what's happening right now it ask me questions and gives me no way to answer them the app is broken",
"All of a sudden this weekend, the app stopped working. I cannot access it. I was connected with my young daughter where this is the only good way to converse with her due to custody issues, and now it keeps prompting me to create an account and I keep getting error messages when I try. Please fix this. I need to be able to speak with my daughter on the app",
Same issue as Liz Dino! Will not let me add childrens father nor can accept his request to be added but won't let .e delete it and start over. Please get this issue fixed!! Never had any issues till now but it's a bad one! Previously I would have given it a solid 4 stars!,
"Messenger Kids is a great way for kids to chat with their friends. It's so unique for kids. Cool features, fun games, and much more than just a chatting app! You can play games, chat with friends appropriately, and everything is made for kids any age. Great work. Thanks for making this!!",
"I love it! My daughter goes between 2 homes so she gets to be in contact with both step parents, parents, all grandparents, aunts and uncles, and I know creeps cant get a hold of her for any reason. I wish they had access to all face filters though because she loves to play with them.",
"Was working fine for so long, now my child's contacts will not show at all. We've tried removing account and contacts and starting again but still can't get contacts to show, despite then being invited and accepted etc. Same issues now on both my device and my child's. Have sent 4 support requests and not getting any response.",
"Really bad, when you said a message it says unable to send and it's very bad, you can download it but I rather give it a 0 star but you cannot do that, I could of rated it a 0 star, I cannot send messages, also in tablets on calls you cannot let them hear you or do fun challenges! It doesn't work! Bad",
"I installed the app and when I tried to create my child's account it said something went wrong creating the account try again, so I tried again three times and still it will not let me create an account for my child and I'm quite disappointed because I've heard so many good things about it but I can't even get it to work... please fix this issue",
"Ok so, my brother finally got his own account and he added me on his and we got to message eachother, but everytime i tried messaging him it kept on saying unable to send but somehow he could send a message to me, everything that this app needed i had! But overall this is a great messenger app.",
Can't delete pictures the kids took. We use a Kindle Fire. We have reset the device to factory condition. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the App. We have deleted the account and created a new one. Pictures the kid took with the App still come back. There is no way for a parent can delete.,
"Refuses to create an account. No matter how many times I attempt to create an account. I've deleted and reinstalled multiple times and nothing. My friend did at same time as me, and she was able to create her kids accounts.",
Suddenly I can't log in my son's account. I added a new account for my daughter and it happened again. Can you please fix this.,
"This app is so unpredictable. One minute my daughter is messaging back and forth with someone and the next it will say ""unable to send"" next to her message for several hours. It will spontaneously work and is very frustrating. I've reached out to support to no availability or help.",
Awesome app love it great way to use it and great for kidsti enjoy like I'm only 11 and not allowed socaul media and this is a great way to contact and cally friends the only thing I hope you guys can change if possibly if your on call and you are making any kind of video once you start recording you have the opion to turn off the icons at the bottem of the screen that's probably the only bad thingi have to sys toher than that great way to have a safe way to contact friends!,
"This is a great app! My kids use it all the time to chat with their friends! The only things they don't like are that they can't make a group chat unless everyone is friends, and you need a friend code and parents permission to be friends with people. Other than that, great app!",
"Messenger Kids copied Messenger in the name. Besides, this app is for noobs. This app is SO glitchy and stops working during video calls. Don't install this stupid app. You also can't decide the size of your profile picture. This app SUUUUCKKKSSSS!!!!!",
"It's a good start. Need to be able to prohibit video calls and perhaps number number of calls. The kids can only do video calls... which is rude and inappropriate... Update:star returned!. can now finally share hyperlinks! which is how I give kids assignments. combined with google family link, I can allow the kids access to this app for important dialog even when the phone is otherwise shut down. need to be able to add kids to groups",
Very fun for kids . You can block people out.,
"The app is amazing, but the only thing is whenever I call someone it would glitch,and turn my phone on and off over and over again and this has been happening for 2 years now. It really frustrates me",
This app is good enough for my four year old!! When she is a bit older she will be sick of it. Kids are very good with technology these days!! It would be better if there were different vesions for different age groups!!,
I can't even download the app now. Just saying. My phone is kinda crappy and it can't take to much data. So it's not your fault that I cant (+_+). Over all when I used to have this app it was a pretty good app over all. I had this app on my tablet but it was still lagging (Ôø£(ÔΩ¥)Ôø£)Ôæâ. I compare this app to school. This app is very limited. And it tells kids what to do. Like in the drawing game. I think you guys should upgrade the game so there could be near to unlimited things we could do (·µî·¥•·µî),
This is one of my favorite apps it let's kids talk to each other from far away and just I kind of with that there were more cute of filters because some older kids use it and don't like the filters. But over all an amazing app!,
"i love this app. i can stay connected to my friends and family. i can call, facetime, and text. basically a kid version of whatsapp. but can you please add a gallery option for your contact picture? i took a super good picture with a filter and thought, ""oh! ill set it as my picture on my messenger kids"" but it only takes me to camera mode. but otherwise i love this app. thank you bye!",
"Don't like that there isn't some kind of notification when there is new messages from other people. Do you just have to check all contacts everytime you get on? Also, I don't like that I have to get on messenger kids to see my kids messages. I should be able to view them from my own account. Other than that it is a fun app. And nice for messaging my kids while I'm gone or in the evening so they can work on typing and reading more often.",
"Im giving it four stars because its not the best but its ok. Also, i was wondering if you could support bitmoji, the app, so i can use it for texting. but saying, since there are inappropriate bitmojis you make it so you cant use those. thanks!!!",
"It's good but, it could be better. When my child tries to type to her friend it keeps saying ""Unable to send"". But it is good I will give 4 stars because it won't work when she types. But sometimes it will work so that's why I am giving 4 stars. Please fix!",
"Can't get logged in. I've tried updating the app, entering my password and then entering a OTP. It does the same thing and starts all over or gives me a message of account not found. DO BETTER. Your app is complete shite üñï",
"This app is great and all. But there's on problem with this app. The new feature you guys added where it would rather make the app sleep for 5 minutes of the whole night until sunrise. Well heres the problem. My son and his dad would always be awake somewhere at 9 : PM. And well, sometimes he would go outside to do something or somewhat. And then, my son would get bored or lonely because I would be sleeping at that time. So he would call him on here but then the app is asleep.",
I'm wondering if anyone can give me a little help? I'm wondering if anybody knows or the developer knows if I can make the notification or the video calling sound louder or the notification sound louder or change it? Because the reason why I asked this is I miss so many notifications in so many chats from my two boys that it actually gets aggravating. Because I never want my boys to think that I'm ignoring them. But the sad thing is this app I cannot figure out how to make the noise loud,
"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have three children who were using this app regularly but it has logged us out suddenly and will not log us back in. I do not recommend this app at all. It's a complete disappointment, I now have 3 very unhappy children who are unable to 'chat' with their friends.",
I can always text and call with my cousin we always talk on here so great app but you cant delete messages sadly there's a few glitches if you could fix that thanks Also rlly nice quality I love it I can talk to my cousins friends everyone Its really cool also my really close friends are on this app it's amazing here's some problems it glitches when I make videos and voice messages but not all the time but otherwise perfect app love the games filters funny stuff on here Perfect‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ,
Messenger Kids was great - my daughter spent a lot of time chatting and playing games with her friends - then she got logged out 2 days ago. I tried to log her back in and it wouldn't authorize the device. I reinstalled the app. I tried again. It loops to another login screen - won't authorize the device. I had recently installed Skype on a Family Link managed Samsung phone (hers) and so I uninstalled Skype. I changed privacy settings - nothing has worked. Messenger Kids is completely unusable.,
I just accidentally logged myself out of my account Also can u make it so we can delete things from our gallery,
Hi this app is amazing I've had it for 3 months but when I'm talking to my friends sometimes people can't see me and sometimes people can't hear me but worst of all sometimes when I'm texting my friends It randomly makes everything unable to send,
"Meh, It's okay but if it was my decision I would not get messenger kids if I had other options to talk to my friends but it's the only way I can talk to my friends so I have to use it if I want to talk to my friends. 1 I would put freedom in the app every single thing you do in it is controlled by parents it's a annoying sometimes but I like it because if someone tries to hack it they see it. Another thing is it always does this thing where it says session expired but other than that it's good",
"I'd like to say it's a good app and it most likely is, but so far I haven't been able to respond to my son who is 3 because his mother and I are not friends on Facebook so I'm not able to communicate with our child, does anyone know how this app can work otherwise? Do the adults have to be friends on Facebook in order for the app to work properly?",
I love it so much but i wish there was no wifi to it. but i so give it a 5 stars. i love we can talk to famliy and friend. And taking pictures. And playing games. Oh and the filters when you take a picture. And i like how you guys made it to record your vice i love so if dont wannna show your face you can do the voice recorder amd not show your face and when you do just press camera press video and there you go . Also dont mind how i cant type what so ever im so bad at typing sometimes üëçüí¨,
I love this app because you can talk to you friends and family on there and random people don't text you do you have to add your friends or family and it's just so amazing if there was a more stars I would have give it a 10 out of 10 messenger kids is so so fun you should definitely download it it's a good way for your kids to spend more time with their friends if they don't go to the school,
Is good my kids can talk to their friends anytime they want,
"This app is great expeirence you can call tons of friends and family members , you also can add people with adult permission this is a totally free app you just need to sign up with facebook , this a kids safe app and its like there are updates every 2 weeks I completely love this app but the one thing I would change is to try and help the camera a bit better like at high defention but other than that its amazing as a 10 yr old girl i would originally hate the app cause of trends but i love it!",
"Perfect for younger kids you don't trust lol. Mine is set on my phone and my kid's device so every communication comes to my phone and i can monitor in real time. Kids can only contact people i add via my parent account. Perfect for keeping in touch with classmates, minecraft, fortnite and roblox. My kids like to play those games while being on video or voice calls with each other ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è fine with me i get to keep an ear on them üòà",
It will load for a minute or so but then it will just close out of the app. I don't know if this is a problem on my end or it is something wrong with the actual app itself. I also don't like how the parents have to allow you to talk to someone on here. I also don't like how the parents can join in on a kids call at any time. I don't think that this is okay at all. I do not recommened this app one bit. Since the update it is trash! Please change it back I hate it now and so does everyone else!!,
"I love this app but sometimes its so glitchy i sometimes have to reset my chromebook to call again. Also if your gonna use a app like roblox or any other game app and use messenger kids at the same time, your game might be very glitchy. I also have a concern where if i play a game or get on another game it keep saying ""Messenger kids keeps stopping"" and it tells me to close the app or wait. I usally press close app so i suggest using a phone or ipad. Im not trying to say its bad but could fix.",
"I think its a great app! But there is a few pros and con about it though.... Pros: you can text your mom,friend,family member and more, you can play fun games, grow a pet and so many mor fun things! Cons:on samsungs you cant set your profile picture from your gallery,and sometimes its kinda glitchy on the video calls, but its a pretty nice app",
"Very useful, easy to use, and fun. Helps my kid stay in touch with family and friends. *Update 2/22/20: My child is suddenly no longer able to send me or receive messages from me. It was working yesterday. This is our primary purpose for using this app. Please fix this problem ASAP.",
It a good app but you should put like when your calling you can make it look like your in a different place and add that the game when you grow your pet when its fully grown a new one comes please add more stuff and you can delete messages you typed and can send stickers ok that's why I give it a 4 star rating ....,
This app isn't half bad but I really wish you could delete certain messages and stuff like that. I am currently having some problems with this app because when I want to type I have to tap 2x which isn't hard but I wish I didn't have to do that. But like I said it's not that bad :),
Great app for all ages and cognitively disabled. I use it for my 9yr old and she loves it but doesn't get addicted like video games or youtube. I also helped friend setup for her 2yo and 6yo typically developing kids and 13yo autistic. All three can maneuver app easily. My other friend's 9yo son was able to create group chat for all 5 kids to use simutanously and that was great feature to stop 2yo from wrestle with 13yo for screen time because neither cognitively able to share one device.,
You can talk to your HOLE family!!! You can also have halarious filters but nothing is inappropriate. I also love this app bc my parents can control me and see what my friends are texting me! My parents can also set a time where I can get on in morning. At night my parents can also set a time for it to go to sleep. I hope you enjoy this app!!! God blessüíñüíñ,
"This app was AMAZING at first but now I can't call or text any of my friends and it's horrible. It says ""sorry no internet"" but my internet is perfectly fine I've tried everything: restarting app,redownloading it, turning off and on the internet. It's such a pain know I can never talk to my friends to tell then what's going on or make arguments to see eachother. So please get back to me messenger kids or fix it.üò¢üò°",
Having the same login problems as others. Trying to set the app up on my daughters new tablet but wasn't working so logged her out of the app on my phone and now it won't log in on either devices!! When I log into my Facebook account it tells me kids messenger is logged in but I can't access it.,
Just keeps doing a loop at login the password is correct so it's an issue with your app. There are other reviews in the last couple days stating this as well. I can't get it to work on even my own device.,
"Hey guys as everybody has said about the typing problem ,, but now it has been fixed by the developer after the current update so u can now use this app in a better way. But the reason to give 4 stars is that pls add an audio calling option there is only a video call available pls add audio calls.",
"Fix your app, everytime my kid goes to record a video, a bit after, it reopens the app and she is not able to record it. Please fix this because she wants to send videos to her friends and cries because she can't.",
its ok but i sent all the invatations and i got no friends so 0 stars is what i give it,
"My daughter is eight years old, and i didn't want her having an active calling phone but needed away for 1. her to get a hold of me when somewhere she may be uncomfortable with other family....and 2. our wifi reaches outside, so if there is an emergency and I am a few minutes behind her I can let her know that so no one is panicking..  Thank you for creating this and for it being free!  God bless",
I love this app... But as a parent I would love to be able to have a toggle in the controls 'do not disturb' or 'busy right now' or even 'parents say I need a break' so that if they are using the device for school work there isn't multiple calls or messages coming in,
"I cannot remember my password. I am willing to create a new one. I am phone technology challenged. At one point yesterday I managed to click a tab and was sent a temp PW and I thought I had changed it . Last night it kept telling me to accept policies. I did that 2 or 3 times. Just when I thought I had it, it told me I tried to many times! I simply cannot figure out what I'm doing wrong!! PLEASE HELP‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó",
"Me and my friends chat all the time but can it not require wifi? Because it all ways go's ""bleep bleep bleep"" And the call is over. And can you make it to where in a game it has like a face cam feature so you can show your friends what you are playing and show them how to do something in the game? That would be nice. and can you add a normal call feature so we don't always have to video call? That would make this app 100 times better Thanks -Sincerely Galaxy fox",
What I dont like about this app is that I have an android and on the IPads ot Apple devices you can select a picture from your gallery and then on the androids you can't another thing is that you can't use this app if you don't have Wifi so I wish you can use this with Wifi. Other than that this app is great!,
We have had this for 2 years and haven't experienced problems until recently. We can't get passed the login screen. It's now an usable app until this gets fixed.,
I think it's great but there are some things that bother me. 1. When I updated it on my grandma's phone It looked new like a new messenger but how many times I update this app It doesn't look the same. 2. I can't delete people I can only block the people. That is pretty much it.,
"Login for my son in his new tablet and same problem with other parents, keep looping ask the same question. Asking the parents verification and keep asking and asking. What is wrong with it?? We did update the apps, reduce the memories, try one time password, bla bla bla but nothing happen. Pleaseee pleassee fix this. Its totally upsetting!!",
Its a great way for my son to communicate with friends and family during all this covid.. Only reason i downloaded it for him. And he knows how to use it. Moslty video calls as hes only 5 and learning how to spell... But love it! Especially when im not around i can call and check up on him.,
"Can't get it to authorize an account. Let's me get to the confirmation part after the name and birthday then says ""account creation failure"". I can only select 'yes' in that screen and try again. No way to get in touch with support, either; just takes you to the forums.",
"The parental controls are trash. There is no simple way to view the child's chat history unless you want to download a file comprising a data dump of the child's activity. There is no easy to determine which group the chid is part or enforce which group the child joins Facebook can easily expose this information and include this functionality, but they purposefully choose not to. Apparently, they feel like they have a more of right to what your child does than you do.",
I installed the app to my child's tablet today and I'm trying to add a few family members for her to talk to but every time it loads I start to scroll and everything disappears from the screen. I've restarted my phone and the tablet. It continues to do the same thing. Please help.,
Messenger kids is the best there's just one little problem but it's kind of common at least I think every time I'm going on like a trip somewhere else it loses like connection and it won't let me talk to anybody especially not even doing any pictures but besides that it's really good you can add friends you can do silly filters you can make group chats you can even name them even if you weren't the one who made it I think everybody should have this it's so good,
I think every thing is great till it comes to sending videos if they are longer than 1min it wont let u send it wich is weird because my friends sebd videos that are 3 minutes long and for me i cant do that. Thats the one thing i would change.,
"Extremely glitchy and I'm not receiving any notifications when my friends message me, despite having all my notifications turned on for the app. Any advice? Wish all my friends would hurry up and get Telegram because I want to delete this rubbish.",
This is an amazing app for kids I love it so much because some of my friends don't have numbers yet so I can face time and text them on here and if you wanna friend someone if texts your parents if there aloud to friend them to be safe so they don't friend strangers if your kid doesn't have a number this is an AMAZING app for them to talk to friends!!‚ù§Ô∏è,
"This is perfect for making sure your kids are only communicating with people they know. Especially useful for staying connected during the pandemic. Suggestion, allow Parents to send links.",
"This app is okay, not the best, tho. I recommend for small children that have family that use Facebook. Your parent/guardian controls who is in your contacts, but the child can choose to block someone. Although, that sends up a red flag to everyone. Don't download if you are older than 13, or you WILL be bored.",
"Lovw this app! I'm only a kid, I Always wanted to call my friends, And I finally can! Texting is amazing, They don't let you send bad emojis, So I can be safe from others. Others can't friend you without your parents permission. You can send Stickers,Pictures,Gifs,And Videos! Calling is very fun, They even have fun effects to play with during, And out of call! You can send drawings for others to Guess Also. You can make groups, But it's not letting me, Fix that please. I recommend this app!",
"Awesome I love the app for my 11 year old step son. However, I do NOT like the fact that I have to be friends with an adult before he can chat with them. I may want him to be able to chat with his family but not have them as my friends. CAN YOU PLEASE FIX THAT. other that that's I see no problems yet.",
I cannot listen to other people's voice messages anymore and no matter what I do it doesn't work. Also I logged out on my tablet and it won't log back in so please tell me how to fix these problems. Other than that great app!,
"HELP!!! I am not able to create an account for my son as ""a problem has occurred"". Then I am told to ""try later"". This does not work!!! I have contacted FB, but I have not received a reply. I wish I received a response to have this issue sorted, so that my son can contact his friends. :-(",
"Poor. Have tried several times to create, and /or accept an invitation for my granddaughter. Constantly get the message something has gone wrong. So evidently this app has some issues. At this time I wouldn't recommend it for anything!",
Good and fun for my kid think you,
"You can't easier make a account, the process is way to long and I doesn't even register facebook accounts and can't even except registration. Overall I found it better to go with the original messager, honestly highly disappointed with this app, it should be easier to use and register with.",
"I hate this app so much it wouldn't even let my dad put in his email! It kept bringing him back to the login stuff! It kept logging me out and wouldn't let me in the actuall app I'm very disappointed, we wasted 3 hours trying to figure this out for my sister and I do not get this app! Its a waste of time ü§¨",
I can't figure out why I get a failure message when hitting create account and tried it on 2 androids and an ipad. Please help...and I see lots of parents commenting with the same issues and are not getting responses back on how to help with the issues which is even more terrible. So give us a helping hand here on what to do..,
I cannot login to my kids messenger! I have tried and tried and tried to login but won't get past the login stage! Yet on my Facebook we are logged in but yet the app won't go past login ??? Very annoying.. alot of people are having same issue what's going on ???? Getting fixed ????,
This is a great app you can find people that you want to chat to easily and it is super safe and secure for an app it is amazingly easy to chat with friends and family from home or anywhere I love this app and I recommend it to everybody it also has fun badges to collect and questions of the day to send to friends and family you should 100% get this app.,
"It helps me talk to my friends at school also, helps me talk to anyone with out seeing any ""stuff not for kids"" I would totally recommend this app if u want to let your kids talk to their friends safely. In my conclusion the app is great! Problem:When I try to take my profile pic it doesn't let me...",
"I love this! My child uses it to call me while I'm working & to call her father & talk to him. I forwarded her a few pictures I found on FB that were pictures of a bald eagle & it wouldn't show up on her end. Why is that? Privacy & safety for her? It should allow me to send her whatever I want since I'm the administrator of her messenger, you would think anyways. Overall I like this app I guess. Its good & safe for my 6 yr old to use. Thanks!",
"Cannot get it to work. It lets me get to the part where I input child's name and then says error, try again. It's been doing this for weeks and after reading comments and other reviews it seems 7ts been going on for months... Would.love to be able to use it but just doesn't work.",
"It's a great app for your kids or even you! I would highly recommend this, ye only reason it is not a five star for me is because not every parent does not have Facebook or want to get it and that you could not delete messages. Ovrall great app for your friends your kids friends and also a great app for your kids to chat with distant family members! Love this app‚ù§Ô∏è",
It's a good app but when me and my friend send a gif the gif never sends and after we send a gif our text messages don't get through. And sometimes our text messages don't get through even when we don't send a gif and a link it's not working on her side. so we have to call each other please fix it,
"I love this app an overall good kids app to talk with your freinds and family, it's a mix of messenger and Facebook. Although it's a great app designed for kids to talk to people I would love if they added a place where you could add stuff and have a story and make the app a little more like Facebook not just a kid friendly messenger. Overall a good app and safe!!",
"It's confusing. There are no instructions to explain actions or options enough. Good that I can control who can contact him. However, the password is for what? And approving requests don't say what I'm approving.",
"Can't login! Just like the previous few reviews, login doesn't work, just a continuous loop of finding account & entering password. App is non-functional at the moment",
"I really like messenger kids. My only complaint is that I can't play the games in messenger with my kids using messenger kids. Please add the games in, I want to teach my kids Chess and that would be a really easy way to do so since Messenger has it built in. The Chess games on Play Store aren't so great and most require you to be physically with the person you're playing against.",
"other people i know have this app and it works great but im trying to make an account and all it keeps saying ""something went wrong while we were creating your childs account. please try again."" so i try again and it keeps saying the same thing ive tryed woth different emails and uninstalling it but nothings working please fix it so i can use the app",
"Please update this app. I have been trying to sign my child into her account for a couple of days now and after putting all the information in correctly I keep getting a message saying "" Log in failure we are unable to login your child then gives me an option to TRY AGAIN I click Yes and keeps giving me the same message. Please Help thank you",
"Please fix the ability to authorize a device. This has been down for days and affecting multiple users. My son who relies on the app to communicate with friends and family, was bumped out of his account and will not allow me to log him back in. Tried reporting it to no avail.",
"This is a realy fun app for kids and I get to talk with anybody at home or othe place & I like the games but for some reason it always tells me that I have No connection at all, it only works at home,school,and different counties! +the game are to baby like and when I said I liked the games because u can send pictures of the game your playing.and we can't delete the things we did not mean to say, but the only thing I care about that it's a really nice game to chat withe peopleüòÅüòÅüòÅüíúüíôüíö",
It's a good app on my phone but I cannot get it to start on my Samsung tablet tab 4. It just keeps kicking me off. I've tried Uninstalling and format reset. nothing works so far. will Change my rating once it works,
This app is stupid ngl it won't let me talk to pepole instead it makes the sound it makes when you cut out. I've been texting them nonstop and it doesn't send it to my freind. Overall tho this app is dumb I don't see whats wrong with having Plain messenger. Hope they fix this because this is really annoying.,
"Messenger kids is an awesome app that is amazing for younger children to talk, text and have funny filters on while they facetime. Its a fun game, but the downside is that it glitches alot!!!!!!! If the glitching were to stop, i would happily give this game a 5/5!!!!",
"Messenger Kids is a great app!!! I love the new update! But after I got the new update, I wish you could change your theme. Could you also make audio calls an option? I also would like if you could save videos. Thanks!! Oh! And one more thing, could you allow Bitmoji? Please remeber, this isn't negative feedback, these are just improvements that would make me like Messenger Kids even more!",
"I keep getting an error message saying ""Account Creation Failure"" after registering the device with my FB account and then trying to set up my kid's ""account."" This happens on Kindle Fire, Android phone and iPhone. I have emailed the customer support at the developer contact email provided here in Google Play, and also messaged them at Messenger Kids through Messenger on Facebook. All this a week ago and still no response, and still getting the error message.",
"When I downloaded it, I thought like ok ok I'll be able to facetime my cousin on my laptop! It sounded cool. But it ask for your facebook account but I dont have one. I wish it would of told me earlier. But I've been on it on my grandma's ipad and it's pretty good with the filters and stuff",
I love IT I think its so cute but I also love the fact that I can keep an eye on my girls. that not just anyone can mess them.another plus is I can put it to sleep on school nights and school hours. think it's an awesome app. I have made my kids phone completely kid friendly üòä,
Ok so a great app very fun and entertaining with the games and stuff you can do but there's a little bug or I glitch I found when I try to search for my friends so I can add them and I type there name for example my friends name is Hannah but when I typed it it put hha and then when I tried to delete it it kept adding h's. But other than that a good app.,
Really easy to use with no ads!,
This is a really fun and good app to communicate with your friends and family I love it so much I would really recommend installing this app. Also something that you could fix is so that everyone can use their gallery photos for their profile that's all I would like fixed thanks üòä,
"Great messaging app for kids and parents. Ability to approve ""friends"" & oversee your childs chats. Been a great tool to help teach safe online social navigation. Gives parents peace of mind, & allows quick intervention to stop anything inappropriate and discuss it with your child. Neg- Wish parent could approve anyone without friending them or code. Also wish app was compatible for receiving links from the parents accounts, and appropriate gifs as well as the mini emoji option for each comment.",
"I am having the same issues as others going by the current reviews; app has logged me out and will not allow me to log back in. Have changed my FB password, uninstalled/re-installed, logged help requests with FB and no response. Frustrating! Wondering if this has been impacted my Optus Breach??",
"Super cool, easy to use. Love that i can monitor everything! I wish the video quality was better and we didnt lose signal so often. Otherwise great app!!",
I love the app. Both my kids have it 7 yr old and 9 yr old...they talk to family and friends and I approve who they chat with which is great. The only thing I was having an issue with is went you put the app to sleep it wouldn't work at times...but overall great app!,
"Ugh, so many bugs and issues. Can't send gifs from my regular messenger, and it keeps saying error cannot send try again later to any regular texts. Also won't add certain families fb accounts even though they are friends with the parent/guardian.",
It is very slow its not just my internet and it makes me click things more than once but it is very good i think that kids 7 to 12 should use this app.if u are reading this and u have not got the app get the app its very good i sugest it,
I don't get any notifications when my son calls.,
"i do like it, but I have a complaint. I was able to send messages to a friend of mine for a couple minutes until all of the sudden I wasn't able to send anything. Neither me or my friend has blocked each other, she's able to send message's to me but I'm not able to send messages to her, my connection is fine.",
I love the app because I can talk to my family and friends but I wish there were more colors to choose for the text and also the app started to like cut the side edges of the video call making it look weird,
Downloaded the app on my daughter's Motorola phone and I put in my information to verify my account and it keeps saying check your connection I have service....so I used my phone and everything went through just fine and we are on the same phone provider.....has anyone else had this issue and if so how do you fix it? My daughter has friends and family she wants to keep in touch with.,
Safe app for my 7 year old daughter to use. Her friend requests have to pass through me first so there is no inappropriate contacts made AND she tried to send an inappropriate pic to someone and it was declined and a message sent to me straight away! (Apparently a pic of someone's butt is hilarious at 7 years old) Extremely happy.,
"its great except i would love it if there were more colours to decorate your app with. maybe some black? other than that, i have no other suggestions, or problems. thanks!",
You have the opportunity to choose who to talk to. It is the best thing for kids because no stranger can randomly text your child. It is not only that you can also look at what they are doing so you can supervise. You can choose who they talk to and you can get all you old friends üë≠üë¨ back in touch it's a great choose you should really try it.,
I LOVE IT I USE IT FOR ALL MY VIDEOS AND TO EDIT MY PICTURES AND I NAME GROUPS LIKE PARENTS OF ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§... AND FREIND BEND AND I KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IT ALERTS ME WHEN I HAVE A NEW TEXT MESSAGE FROM MY FAMILY AND FREINDS! you must get this app kids! I also agree to some of the other reviews it can be a little annoying sometimes but you have to get used to it this review would go on about good stuff but I have no more room...,
"It's a good app to text and call your friends, but today went I opened it, it said 'session timeout, logging out' I tried to log back in but it just kept saying 'logging out' I Uninstalled the app and got it again but when I tried to log back in it went 'email, password, email, password' and wouldn't log in anyone else having this problem??",
"So since I'm on a kindle fire It won't work and I can't see notifications when someone text me so I have to check it a lot, it's getting really annoying .Also I have to leave them on for a few days without even knowing that they texted me and I missed video calls offten My notifications are on but it's still not helping can you plz fix that?",
"I downloaded this and can't do anything with it. When I try to link it to my account, as the adult that is setting it up, it gives an error message that says ""We limit how often you can post, comment or do other things in a given amount of time to help protect the community from spam. You can try again later"". Even though im not trying to do any of those things! Has anyone else had this problem or know how to fix it?",
I love this app but one thing is that all my other friends that have an apple device have cool updates like the new layout and how you can turn off your camara on call that i dont have and its getting on my nerves. And I wish that they had more colors like pastle and different colours.Other then that its a good app.,
"The app will not work on Chromebook. As soon as it opens, it freezes and crashes. I tried to delete and reinstall, but it continues to do the same thing.",
This is one of the best apps in the intire world üåé it is soooooooooooo fun üòÄ I take pics and send them to my bffs üíñ and the only big problem is the app is slow because so many people use it üòâ and my mom and dad chose the people that are my contacts. and it has soooooooo many fun things if you are a parent and your kids ur dont have this they should get it. it is probably the most safe texting and face chatting app for kids!!!!!‚ñ™Ô∏é,
"ever since I got the update, it just gliches, and goes back to home screen, and now it isn't even on my device, but it says that it's still installed. I liked to message my friends, but now i can't. before the update it was a great app.",
I am thankful for this app so my daughter can safely stay in contact with distant family however lately I've been having a hard time adding a family member it keeps giving me an error message and I don't know how to fix it I uninstalled and reinstalled my main messenger app and it did not fix the problem. I need assistance please!,
"Good app, I like that i can control the app from my phone when it's being used on my child's tablet. A really neat feature is that I get all the messages, calls, and video calls as my child is receiving them.",
Good and appropite for kids,
"It's amazing, it's a texting app for kids and that's genius. One downside, the filters get changed every week and I don't like that.",
This is a great way for kids to connect and the games are great. My only issue is that you don't seem to be able to delete messages or photos. This is a problem for me because sometimes my daughter can send photos i would rather she didn't.,
"Now I see why all the reviews visible are from an old version. I can not get this version of this dumb app to work. It wants to authorize my device through my fb account but it can not even find my account and there are no work around abilities. The website, help section were of no help and the email file the market sent me to what I have already tried.",
"I LOVED IT SOO MUCH!!! I know that it is sort of a rip off of Messenger but now me and all my friends can contact each other. I do wish it had more filters and more missions. More stickers too. I can't exactly figuer out how to find my code. Other than that, I LOVED IT!",
"l cannot open my messages, just downloaded app last night and says my password is incorrect. There is no messages sent to my email or messages. Don't know how to get into app. I'm the adult user.",
it wont let me save the videos like it does the photos and I'd really appreciate it if you would allow pictures from gallary as a profile picture too. I just really need this to be in the nwxt update. oter than that its good,
"It's great for kids has the high quality when messaging, only problem is when I updated it nothing changed. It changed on my phone in other words. I hope it changes soon though.",
"Great for mt son to keep up with family. The video portion is horrible though. Can't hear on the chat and sending videos they don't work most of the time, showing there's s video but you can watch it. The stickers are funny and my son loves them",
"It keeps freezing when I'm trying to text my daughter. And the video chat keeps freezing and echoing. It's beyond annoying. üôÑ And she said it's not just us , it's everyone else she knows on it too ! Please fix this!",
"Cant even get past the login screen! Keeps telling my password is wrong, which is not but yet i still tried to reset my password to be able to login and facebook will not send me the email or text a code to me. Also while trying to reset password doesnt even tell you if its going to be emailed or sent via text. So if you can actually get logged in it may be a good app but we wont ever know. Frustrating!",
Great way for kids to connect with their friends. But with added safety of allowing parents to know who their kids are talking to. By allowing only the parent permission to accept/decline your childs friend requests. Kids can also video chat. He loves videoing with cousins & his school friends. I love it bc I don't have to worry about who/what stranger my childs talking to.,
My son uses this app to talk to his friends when they play games online together. Unfortunately he can't connect his calls to his Bluetooth headphones so we will probably be switching to another app so that he can play with his friends without disturbing the whole house.,
"This is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo great! Love the app I get to text my friends and family and video call! and I love that they made the game""heathy habits"" it helps with well... healthy habits! With everything that's going on in the world that's helpful for me and everyone on earth,This paragraph was by me a creative kid.Thanks for reading this and I'm glad you made it to the end here's a cookieüç™üç™üç™:)))))))",
"My kids used this to keep in touch with family and friends and without warning or notice they were ALL kicked out and I have been ""banned"" from logging them in again. I get a notice telling me that I'm not allowed to access their accounts or create new ones. I was not even told why.",
Been trying to set up on a brand new device and I continuously being taken back to the start once password to verify has been entered! What is going on?? Please fix the problem and PLEASE can someone reply as to what is happening! Incredibly frastrating when this is normally such a good App! Please please fix ü§ûü§û,
"It's so glitchy and now everything's blue I used to be able to choose my color, it crashes uncontrollably and and the new style is trash! I HATE THE STYLE I LIKE MY PURPLE NOW ITS BLUE I HATE BLUE! Get another messaging app other then this the only reason I still use this app is because I can't find one that's compatible with my phone model!",
It's a good app for kids but when you send a photo it's usually jest gray and when you make a video call its usually gliching. Also when you make a video call it hangs up most of the time.,
"This app is a great way to text and facetime with your frrends if you dont have a phone. There are no ads with this app. There are other fun things on this app like filters, stickers for pictures and you can ask would you rather Questions",
Frustrating and unstable. My daughter uses Messenger Kids to connect with her grandmothers. One day chats and video calls stopped working and the error is unhelpful to fix the problem. When the app works it's great but not being able to chat for weeks defeats the purpose of such a messaging app.,
I love this app it is perfect the only thing is that well my friend gets to make short little music videos and i have tryed so hard to do that there are no ads great way to communicate with your friends and parents but if you dont have 8nternet you cant text or call,
"This is a great app, just my daughter tried installing it on her laptop. But she couldn't get on it. She tried whatever she could think of and I even tried helping her! I feel like this app should be able to use on any type of computer. I really like the app it's safe and all that stuff kids like having, just she couldn't install it on her laptop! I have a lot of things I have to do and she is old enough to stay home with her sister. Just she could not get it on her laptop, I really think that the people who made this app should make it so people on laptop or any other computers can install it on there.",
"This app doesn't work. I cant authorize device. I put in password and it keeps looping back to the password and authorize screen. If it's a bug, it needs to be fixed.",
"This app is fully child safe and is super fun for everyone. I've downloaded quite a few 'childrens apps' but they've always been aimed at, like, 5 yrs and younger, but this one is fun for all ages. I fully recommend downloading.",
"10/10! This app has helped me to communicate with my friends both in Maine, Chandler, and New York City. Although, there are a few problems. You see, once I was talking to my cousin on Messenger Kids and I went onto my front poarch, and what happened? HUh? Well lets see, Messenger Kids literally stopped the video call. WOW! One good reason about Messenger Kids, which is why I am giving them 5 stars is because, they have fun faces, and games on the call, you can record videos of yourself, and the new update is just, muah! Thank you to the person that came up with it!",
Can't log in due to constant authorization requirement. This is super frustrating because it worked for three days and now my daughter can't use it again. I've tried multiple ways to seek help with no success.,
Its really hard to add people. It has a section where you can add family members but not all my family members are listed and there's not a way to search for them. Only to search or invite for a parent who has a kid my kids want to add. Same for people who aren't family but are close friends that my kids want to talk to and it shows just a little bit of my friends list and not everyone and again no way of searching for them.....wasted 3 hours of my time trying to figure it out...no luck,
"Although messenger kids is pretty good so far, but I would give messenger kids 5 stars only if they have kept the previous filters, then messenger kids would have LOTS of cool filters. Also, 1 complaint I have about this app is, whenever I try to chat with my friend, it always blacks out when she starts the call. This scenario might have to do with her device that she is using (Maybe).",
Amazing app. I can connect with familly and do cool stuff BUT. Whenever i try to do a game for example‚Äî the pet thingy. Its just a black screen with a loading circle.,
"Good app, but the suggestions at the top are kind of annoying, and there is very limited GIFS and if you could put more setting to the color of the texts like Gradient that would be nice..",
"Personally, I am 11 years old. I have most of my family, and a friend to message. Although, sometimes while me and my friend are talking, it won't let me message him and it says, ""Unable to send."" It is very annoying. I think the reason is because he lives in Canada (and I live in America). Either way, can you fix it? Thanks.",
When will this issue be fixed. I see multiple complaints about the same thing. I try to log in and it just keeps resetting and telling me to log in. It's now been 3 weeks. I can't believe a platform like face book is not fixing this.,
"Its ok, I mean it gets the job done as long as you don't log out because I recently had to get a new phone and I tried logging in but it wouldn't let me. I've had to make like 10 different accounts it's ridiculous. But really it's decent it does what it needs to do most of the time.",
This app I use everyday but recently I have discovered when I message someone a couple times without a response no more messages will send. It won't send anymore for literally 3 hours and it annoys me so much. Please fix this stupid bug.,
"When I authorize the app, it acts like it is going to log in and then a pop up that says logging out shows up for half a second before taking me back and adding to authorize the acct again. I've tried on 3 different devices. Any ideas?",
"As frustrated as a lot of other reviews- it will just not let me authorise a devise. Changed passwords, did one time code, different device all results in being looped back to the authorise device screen. Please fix this!",
I can text my mom and dad + more! U can play games and send photos videos and saved photos and saved vids I love this app it works really good! It also reminds us about covid-19 that we should wash our hands do touch our faces and more!! That ia why I give it 5 stars!!‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ,
So I love this app because it helps me contact with my family and friends a bit better but one thing I do wish is that there is a way to save videos and not just pictures cuz they've been so so many videos I wanted to save but I wasn't able to so please make it able so you can save videos thank you,
Update: clearing app cache seems to fixed the issue. Update: got through login screen but says no account found and now I'm stuck at Try Again loop. Terrible. Won't get pass the login screen despite entering the correct password and auth code.,
"Hey! I absolutely LOVE this app!!!‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° But I have an update recommendation! Could u PLEASE make it so you can record your video chats and that way you can go back and watch them???? A very best friend and I always had the thought of ""What if we could go back and watch our video chats??"" So again, pls pls pls PLS add this ideal recommendation! Ps. ............pls????üôÉ",
Amazing kids love it,
although i like talking to my friends there is always a problem every single time i send a message it doesnt send it and it is at a random time when to send it and i sent lots of photos and gif and it doesnt work i tried to unninstall and reinstall the app I restarted my phone etc. but it doesnt work please fix this.,
I love the security measures it takes to protect the kids and allows them to have fun and communicate with their friends and family. The best part as a parent is that I get to track EVERYTHING since everything happens under my Facebook and needs my permission before being approved. This is a win win for parent and child especially if you're like me and you're not really ready for your elementary schooler to have a cell phone.,
I talk to all the homes EVERY day and I love doing it every time -11 Me,
"This app doesn't work in landscape mode. All controls are meant for portrait, so little kids with little hands need to hold the tablet upright. Fail.",
It was very good for my child she really loved the app nothing was wrong with it either,
"Good, but needs improvements!! As the parent managing my kid's accounts I should be able to do more. I should be able to hear the notifications when they actually happen (I donxt even get notified anymore). This app is great for kids to connect...When it works.",
"I recently downloaded this app and I have gotten as far as downloading and authorizing the app, also sending messages . Now as a parent I enjoy you have the control to filter everything your child has access to, but is stunted by which platform you readily have available. I have a Samsung.The parental controls are not accessible to me . Which means I can not approve or edit anything on her profile .I am quite surprised since FB has a billion people using their app. Please make more user friendly.",
"All of my friends have this app, but you can, I call people text people, video chat, but you have to have a Facebook account, or your parents or someone in your family, Facebook account, well, no one has a Facebook of how only my grandparents, so don't get this game unless you know someone that has a Facebook account, you can use it.",
"Great app for kids and for them to connect with family friends. However, the video/call option needs a ring limit to where the call automatically stops after so long.",
It's a great app! I use it all the time! I am a very lazy person so it helps me talk to my mum when I want to/need to. It also helps me reconnect to my friends since I barely get to see them cause of Corona and stuff so I totally recommend this app!,
"This is a great app for kids to safely communicate. As a parent, I enjoy the app too; my only suggestion is that you find a way to remove the top bar that says your child has requested to chat with another person once that request has been satisfied as it eats into screen view.",
"It is amazing to talk to my friends during quarantine, and I love the speicial effects and games you can play while on video calls! I saw a one star review complaining that it was not good and that you should stick with the original Messenger. This app was made for kids so if you are old enough then don't use it! Also, another one star review said that it was bad for teens and tweens because it was so childish. It is for kids, so of course it is childish.",
OUTRAGEOUS AND HORRIBLE. So I got this app and I typed in my Facebook account and set up her b-day and everything went good but than I clicked the button and it said creation failed or somthing. I deleted apps and photo uninstalled the app redownload it and it said the same thing. Than it said update I kept on clicking it and it didn't work. Fix this and I'll think about changing my review. Thanks bye,
Amazing game but 2 things when i am in a video call it is very laggy when i try the filters and my camera goes off and i cant fix it most of the time and i cant even talk to my friends it says unable ro send and its really annoying please fix this and i will give 5 stars 1 thing added can you plz add really cool filters the others are really boring the i promis i will give 5 stars P.s. needs a new layout1,
"Like with many others leaving 1 star reviews we are unable to log in to my daughters account. After attempting to turn sleep mode off, We are in a cycle of being asked to log in then after thinking for a while it says logging out. There has been no reply/advice given by the makers on how to fix this issue. Very disappointing.",
"Cannot set up because Facebook does not let me log in. Every time I put in my email they say they cannot find my account. But , I have no problem getting on Facebook whenever I want. It's just weird.",
"This is awful. Let's start with how do I delete an account? Why can no one find their friend codes, how does my husband keep ending up in charge of the account, why do I have to keep creating new accounts just to add some one cause the ""find contact"" button you send me just leads to my fb page on chrome? I have more complaints!",
"the app works well and is good for.... YOUNG kids. I think there should also be an option in settings to make the app LOOK like the real messenger since older kids who are using this, like me, might be embarrassed about using this around people. I also wish Android had dark mode and message colour customisation (my friends on iphones can customise it a lot more than me). also I keep getting this bug in which I get notifications for messages I received months ago. other than that, good app",
"Every time I try to create an account I keep getting the message "" account creation failure something went wrong please try again"" Should be so simple!! After so many attempts I just give up. So much for communication with my grandkids during Covid19. Really disappointed.",
Please fix the login issue. I have been trying for days to login on new and reset devices to no avail. There is absolutely nothing so frustrating as a kid just wanting to chat with friends and having to tell them that the app they use and love is broken.,
The best app for texting and calling for children is this! But there is one slight problem... The sleep mode. It is very hard to put it in the right time.,
it's cool I just don't like how if you want to send like a link or something you can't or like a certain pic you can't or if you talk too much in a group it makes it so you can't send anything but other then that its pretty good just wish they would fix the filters,
"I wish we could add Facebook users that are not on our friends list, I am not friends online with most of the young users without 'kids messenger', using regular messenger who are actually friends with my kids who are only on kids messenger.....so their availability to them is not available? Im unable to add without these tweens installing kids messenger which they don't, because they already have Facebook messenger.....If this glitch was fixed I would recommend app and give 5 stars",
"Can't log in!! Used to love this app. Had it perfectly on a different phone, got a new phone, tried to log in and it just loops in never ending circles at the login.",
I like it but all my friends have a bunch of games when I only have play a drawing game and grow ur pet and also it's so annoying cuz I want to make my profile a pic of my dog from my gallery but I can't so instead I went to did a filter and u can't do that either! üò° I'm tired of it but I still enjoy talking to my friends but I just wish it was better and we can do our own emojis cuz messenger kids doesn't have all the emojis üò°,
It's fun trolling my friends but it's glitchy,
"Try to video chat with my daughter and I cant see her bc it is constantly playing ads, despite searches stating it is not supposed to allow ads.",
for the past few years I've been trying to get into messenger kids Once I did and then my mom deleted my account and next time I did it And so yeah and right now I'm trying to get in and it says creating account and it says something more wrong in the system and this happened last time and so I'm trying to get in over and over again it's not letting me So please please fix this problem ! Thank you,
"love this app!! I set it up on MY fb messenger, then I downloaded it to her phone an logged her in an I went an added the people she knew on my friends list an they chat when ever! theres not been any glitch or freeze or crash! I have a galaxy 9+ an she has iPhone 6. no problems!! an I seen where 1 person said their kid could talk to strangers?? UM NO THEY CANT! They can only talk to people on ur friends list or people u add .",
It is supposed to be kid friendly so that is good that it is not very advanced but I do think that you chould be able to delete texts just in case they are inapropriate but other whys I think it is a great app for kids.,
"It's good but could we get an posting feature? Like were the kid can try to post a picture or video and it has to go through the parent first? I feel like more people would use this if you did that. Note, sometimes it won't notify you of texts.",
"It does not allow you to add the other parent or aunts/uncles It would be nice to add adults as well. Other than that, I love how much control I have over what my daughter is doing. I can see videos and pictures and who she is talking with and how often. Gives me security.",
"It won't let me create an account for my child, I've tried several times to make one, but then I exceeded the amount of times to try, it just keeps saying failure, but doesn't give me a reason why, I just created a Facebook and haven't connected anything to it, I don't understand why I'm having this issue...",
I wish I could send gifs and links to my child so we can share videos etc together.,
"Wish there were more individual controls. Some family contacts are and don't understand video chatting. The kids become a nuisance to them. ü§£ I would like to be able to turn off video chatting capabilities under an ""advanced control"" option.",
I love that my child has the ability to safely speak to her friends because they're too young for phones and Facebook. The only downside is that I can't share videos (as her mother) to her. I like the safely. But I feel I should be able too.,
"It's great, except..We use it for my 3 year old son to communicate with his dad out of town so he's not adding a million people to a group chat (which has happened often) on my account and this way when he's a little older I can hand him the iPad to talk to dad and still have my phone. Anyways we've never ever EVER gotten a single notification. I have to open the app and chats to see if his Dad has messaged. Running a moto z3 play all notifications are enabled I have no idea.",
"It's a great app that allows my kids to safely chat with family and friends while I can monitor what all is being said. we live too far out to video chat. I would love if there were more games, especially educational games for them to play with friends.",
"Messenger kids has suddenly logged out my child and we can't seem to be able to log in, I enter the right information and it takes me back to the Log into Facebook, I want this fixed. We've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, reseting and everything it won't work. Please fix",
Will not let me log in. Keeps asking for device authorization credentials. I give my email and password but it keeps coming back to the same screen to enter again in a constant loop.,
I love this app my Child can call and text family and friends!Works Really well And you can call and text for free! My child has been using this app since she was 7 and now she is 12!She loves the new music video update!I really recommend!,
It's a great way to stay in contact with you kids without providing them with an actual phone line. I do find it difficult to add an additional child to your account as well as switching devices.,
"New phone can't log in. My daughter uses this app all the time but now that I have had to download the app on the new phone it won't let me log in. It keeps repeating the ""Authorize Device"" screen. Fix & I will rate the app better.",
"This app is so good, but it did give me some problems whenever I would log out, always give me problems, so it would always bring me to home, sometimes I always try and try to get back in, but I have to reset it so this is a perfectly good app, but sometimes I can give you some problems, it has really good games and has fun challenges todo, they have wood, you guys are games, and you can do whatever you want, it's so fun but sometimes you can have problems",
"It keeps telling me over and over account creation failure, no matter if you uninstall reinstall. I have sent emails to app Creator as of today still no response. It was a cool app while it worked but my child is sad to not be able to use it anymore for chatting with their friends.",
I'm thankful that I gave this a 1 star it's because when I went in the app it needs your email I put my email in there after it just said email was not found I tried like: 1000 times it just kept saying email was not found its super annoying all my other friends have messenger kids and I want it too but it won't let me:(This app does not even seem like it's for kids please fix it!,
"Is a great app and works great. For those who couldn't get it to work, make sure you download it on your phone and set up as parent. Then when you want to check on your childs history just go into kids messenger and you can see who they have talked to and what was said.",
"Why do you have to have a Facebook account to use it, it's pretty stupid how you would have to go out of this app then into Facebook, make an account there and then come back into messenger and then set up more stuff, there are too many unnecessary steps when you could just set up an account right there in messenger on the spot",
It is nice! Wish I could download it on multiple devices for my daughter. I would like to have it on my phone and on her tablet. Also I wish she could change her profile picture easier. Be able to use a picture from the gallery.,
Oh yes! Finally a texting app where I can text all of my friends! This app is amazing I can text all my friends and super kid friendly. If your looking for a texting app specifically for kids then I recommend this one.,
"i like this app, but i wish there were more filters. I also wish they wouldn't remove the filter that they already had but other than that this is a great app and I use it a lot I also wish that the share song app would have more songs to share",
"This is a great app, it let's me talk to my friends and no charges. Even when your bored there is all sorts of stuff to do like play games and take funny photos and videos. But the reason I'm giving it four stars is it was really hard to register in the app at first.",
The video chat won't work. We are only able to call. I have even tried to make sure all permissions were on for the app and other things to try to get it to work. That's the only thing I have an issue with :(,
I love this app a lot but I wish this app had audio calls instead of just video calls and also if they could add more colours to the app and not have so many notifications every time you get a message from someone but other than tjat this app is just great but I would only use this app to call my friends and family to play roblox together :),
"Pretty good but it would be great to be able to delete pictures and videos from messenger kids and not only from our phone. Also to see from our phone the chats, not having the only option to see it on their apps",
"Hard to add a friend through the app itself. I had to go to my regular messenger app to add friends to my kids, where I get a nice list of friends suggestion. Doesn't seem to work on regular PC. Can't add my kid's mother (ex-girlfriend) as an extra parent on my kid's account because she isn't a facebook friend.",
"GO TO THE 5 DOTS IF YOU WANNA SEE MY REVEIW. I wish there was a app where like all the kids in the world could just hang out, like Facebook you can share links and post the funniest videos, and what's trending, I hope the animators of messager kids can make this app happen! .....Other that that this app is awesome , Yiu cant use photos from your gallery as profiles tho, Or customize your friends name, or share links, or turn yout cam off. BUT ITS AWESOME. I LOVE ITTT! Thanks byee!",
I love this app for my kids it's safe and runs good I never have to worry about strangers it's gives me less stress I can also see who they have been talking to do that's good one thing is that my kids can send me gifts but I can't send them gifts idk if it's a glitch In the setting or just my phone but overall it's a really good idea just a few bugs here and there also the little games are good and safe another thing is that they have no swear words or anything inappropriate stuff like that,
This app is amazing just the type of thing that I'm looking for in a texting and calling app and there are no adds and it's just wow and you don't have to get a phone number or a phone bill it just needs Wi-Fi this is just the right app for kids and parents I recommend this to everyone and you can just talk to your friends and family and face time with anyone this is the best app I ever had,
"It's a fun app but I can't manage my kids account unless I'm on a computer. Since I set the kids account to sleep, the app just jumps to the ""your app is asleep"" screen. I also doesn't hold onto parents log in (which is good unless you're trying to figure out how to change the sleep time when it keeps kicking me out!). I recommend the app developers just add a sleep toggle in addition to the timer. And fix the parents ability to admin the kids account from the app screen when sleep timer is on.",
"Tried 5 different facebook account names to log into this messenger kids app, starts to log in then suddenly logging out and then ask to sign back in again and keeps repeating this, l have uninstalled and reinstalled 10+ times still same issue, PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG IS NEW VERSION HAVE A BUG ? Not happy, tried different device same issue start to log in then instantly log out and have to type email and password again.",
This app is great! I really don't like that you can't change your pfp from gallery; instead you have to take a photo. But it's still a really good app to message my family and friends!,
"It won't allow me to create an account. It shows something about EU agreements, even though I'm located in Seattle?! Why??? I've tried contacting fb/meta support but no one gets back to me. We had this app included in our parenting plan expecting to be able to use it. Why are there no solutions???",
"This app keeps blocking me from talking to my son's, who's accounts I manage. It's ridiculous and the block last 24 hours each time. I have reported it multiple times bc I need to have contact with my kids. But it still happens. For absolutely no reason",
Omg this is absolutely adorable for kids. Especially now how everybody has to be quarantined for this virus. Now my son can be able to talk to his classmates from school. It is also a great way to teach him how to read and spell but still having fun doing it. I definitely recommend this to anybody who has kids.,
When I send some thing it some times says unable to send and I tried everything to fix it but it won't work! üò¢üòêüò¢:'( This has happened 3 times in a day. If you could fix this it would be a five stars.,
It's a great way to keep track of what your child is talking to and home she's talking to and what she's talking about I love this app even though my kid tells me everything this app helps explain a little bit more what she's speaking with other friends and home she speaking to you would get notified every time she contact somebody new and cannot accept him or her until you check that person out and decide that's a good person for your child to be speaking to I highly highly love this app and hi,
Love having an option for my son to stay in contact with family while we live so far away. The only thing I would like to see added is being able to add ppl outside of my own friends list....Would be nice to add his father without having him on my own fb friends list.,
"It does not work for me it is always saying ""Account Creation Failure"" and its so annoying. Please fix it so I can use it. If you fix it I will increase the ratings, thank you.",
"Hello! I would like to request a fix, I am in many group chats but all my friends have dissapeared. I have called them (on different platforms) and it shows they still have me as a friend on kids messenger but it does not show me the same. Please fix this, I only can talk to some of them on kids messenger.",
"Worst messenger app I've ever tried to use. I say ""tried"" because I can't even use the stupid thing. Can't create a profile, can't accept requests from others. Can't even message my own kids. Keep getting error messages. Hands down the worst app ever",
It's a good way to talk to your friends and facetime there is some games you can play!Your friends can guess what you draw there are alot of things to do!But got some reason my friend she has this app but her keyboard is different.And she asked me if I had the update and I said idk and I came to check and it doesn't say update!And she has alot more things on her keyboard.I just wish I could get the update.you don't get notifications.But good app.And my screen is blurry cause my phone is Cracked.,
This is a great app children can chat with their friends and even call with them. But I did hear from other people someone asked to add their kid and they couldn't decline so their kid now has a stranger how sometimes chats with them. Also this app lets you say a desent amount of cuss words this is bad knowing that your child could swear online or that their friend could.,
I'm having the same log in issue as others have described. I can't log in on my phone - it just keeps looping back to the login screen. This whole point of using this app is that I can monitor my kids' activity and I am unable to do this right now. Please fix this.,
"I rate this app a 5 star review because it is amazing!! You can literally go off the call that your on without even ending it!! You can face time eachother too, all you have to do is hit the home button iff you want your video off.. you should get this app, bye, have a great day!",
"I thought this would be a good app for my son so he could call his grandma any time he wanted to, from his own tablet. We just tried it out, and when we talked it was in slow motion. It honestly sounds pretty scary. He did not like that AT ALL. Its disappointing because he was excited to have his own way to communicate with his grandma since I don't let him use my tablet. 2 starts because it was a fine app until we tried to use it for the one reason we downloaded it for.",
"Was great.. but now it won't let my kid send messages to me, or receive them. Sole reason we use it. Tried to uninstall/reinstall, now it doesn't work at all. We can't sign in, and get a pop-up about preventing spam..",
My son is also having the same problem with video calls freezing and no sound out bound. His friends can't hear him. I've tried reinstalling and clearing the catch.,
The app takes up 4.36 gigabytes your kids won't be able to get a lot of games to keep them entertained and if you have it on your phone you will not be able to do much especially for Android have the calls don't ring half the time don't get notifications and the app overall is just flat out bad .,
"We are unable to get past the inital log in screen on two devices for our child, it comes up with the error unable to connect to the internet. We'd really like yo be able to use the app on their devices to contact their family.",
"It's amazing but i randomly gets signed out so I have to go to my mother so she can do her Facebook, it honestly gets annoying. I suggest a way to just put in the code you get given so if it signs you out and the parent isn't around and you don't know there Facebook. It would be a lot easier to just be able to put in your code",
"Very good to communicate with my daughter when I'm not with her, and for her to connect with friends. I am however, disappointed that the notifications dont show on her phone... she is not alerted to a new msg that has been sent to her. The notifications are enabled in settings- all of them. I do get notifications on my phone of msgs sent to her- and have to go tell her that soneone has sent her something.. this is frustrating when I'm not with her, especially when its me that is msging her!",
"0 stars is not an option. I was just looking for a way I can communicate with my child via their tablet. The description of this app states that anyone can communicate with the child via the messenger app. I download this app on my child's tablet and It requires a Facebook account to set up. I have messenger, not a Facebook account. My partner uses their account to set up. However I still cannot communicate with my own child.",
"My daughter was so excited to be able to call her friends. When I was making her account it kept saying error and I did everything I could to make the account, but it did nothing.Please fix mine or the app's bug, and I will change my rating!",
"Problematic and incentive. Asks for trusted adult friends, but makes adults create a ""kid"" account. What if the person is unable to conceive, or just lost a child? Also, when going through the ""kids"" options to add as friends, it appears as if all the people are kids, but many are adults because the app forces adults to create a kid accounts even if they don't have children of their own.",
"Horrible.... when I tried to make an account for my child ""Account creation failed, try again"" its not a problem with my phone, there is other reviews also having this problem, I tried it on my child's iPad, iPhone, My iPhone, it does not work. Fix it and I might consider changing the review.",
"Nice app but it doesn't show me which of my son's friends is calling him mist of the time. I just get the ringing noise and nothing pops up to say who it is. I can't even decline the call if I want too, just ringing that I can't stop. It's very annoying.",
"I really, really loved this app until I found out that I can no longer change my theme because of the phone I use, which kinda sucks if you ask me, most of my friends are apple users and it makes me kinda sad that I can't do something because I use an Android, I know there is some conflict with Android and apple lately. If you could change this I would gladly raise my rating to 5 stars!",
I think you should be able to pick the face filters because there are alot of girl ones and a little bit of boy ones and you should be able to make it fast slow or super fast. Overall a good app for kids I give it a ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ. All of the people who give it a ‚òÜ or a ‚òÜ‚òÜ they are wrong I would recommend this for children,
Since the new update this app is trash. It no longer opens. It just flashes and disappears. Can you give us the previous version back until you can fix this issue?,
It's great I just wish that there was a way to customize a character. And to be able to post pictures and videos that only your friends can see and what your friends post you can see too. That's why I'm giving it a four out of five I hope you update it to be able to post.,
I dont really like this app because my child accidentally sent one of her friends something she didnt mean to and it was really embarrassing for her and she couldnt delete it. I would like reccomend letting our kids delete messages because sometimes they can send things by accident.,
"This app is really good except I am not getting any type of notifications from it from friends and family even though they text me, my family will text me and I dont get it until I open the app, and I have all my notifications turned on in settings but I still don't get notifications",
"Good app to stay in contact with my kids while they don't own an actual phone line. We can video call and message, the only thing is, it is really limited in what you can send them in a message for example she can send me GIFS but I can't send them to her, or YouTube videos etc.",
"Not intuitive Set me up as parent, I'm grandma. No way to reset or change or settings options. Couldn't interact with great granddaughter. No contact or help options. Deleted app.",
"I use this app to talk to my younger friends and it is SO glitchy. Also doesn't let you turn your camera off in a call. No great filters, and overall not the best.",
Will not allow me to add child's grandfather. Have been trying for weeks. Have deactivated and reactivated. Will not show grandfather for him to be added. Allowed the adding of other family but will not allow the one person in particular. Very frustrating!!,
"I've heard good things about this app but every time I try to create an account for my kid it says ""account creation failed"" I tried updating and deleting the app but it still gave me problems.Ive tried on multiple devices but it won't let me create an account. Please fix this.",
"It's a really good app and all, but if my daughter doesn't text with one person for a while, they just dissapear from her contacts, and don't reappear untill they text her",
"This is absoultly ridculous! Every time I click on the app, it blinks black for half a second, and then it kicks me out! I just want to text my friend, but I can't even do that! This actally used to be awesome until the update came and destroyed it. Plz fix this! üò°",
UPDATE SAW ANOTHER POST IF YOU HAVE SAMSUNG & UNINSTALL & INSTALL IF FROM GALAXY APPS NOT PLAYSTORE IT WILL WORK!Won't work on my sons kindle fire or my android phone. Just keeps looping back to verify ID. Reported the problem with no response. No way to call to troubleshoot.,
"Amazing app, I get to message my friends easily! and it's so fun to use the filters, I love the bright colors and stuff, I never really had it crash on me and it be the apps fault so I rate this 6 out of 5",
"I tried to set this up for my teen and it wouldn't let her take any pics or videos (we got it to upload a video she made on her phone for Mother's day). It was difficult to navigate around, so I let her make a real Facebook instead.",
If child is shared between separated parents I blocked on Facebook the person that set up her account from that person can be controlled do not get messages for contacted if they choose so which is aggravating leaving causing anxiety or sadness if you get what I mean.? Otherwise it's awesome way to contact your child you get to interact and see them perfectly :-),
"One child was using fine, went to switch accounts and it logged 2nd child out. Then couldn't go back to first child. Uninstalled, reinstalled and now it won't let me verify my device. Sort the problem that so many of us are experiencing",
"Why can I not login? I even changed my password, It's literally a continuous loop after I've authorized the app. Even going to the website for messenger kids and trying to add on my other child. It keeps giving me an error. Can you kindly advise what's going on??",
This app is good and all but it won't let me put more than one minute videos and when I make the video out of messenger kids and it is still over one minute it won't send the video. I hope that this will be fixed soon ‚ô•Ô∏è,
"Overall, it works really well for my daughter. The only issue I have is the app doesn't tell you someone is calling unless you are using the app. Seems to be a common issue (or designed that way?) from what I've read online.",
Good app but there is some glitches I can't make a friend group no matter how hard I try I was just reading reviews on this app and I haven't found 1 person with the same problem i will try restarting my tablet to see if it works then and I'll update this review also I would love it if you could possibly add a color wheel for messages instead of having limited choices and I would love it if you could make it so people could add a profile pic for their groups if so that would be great thank you‚ù§,
"Cannot figure this app out for the life of me. Tried it months ago and gave up, giving it a second chance for my daughters sake. Fun pics and options to keep kids busy but unless you have a PhD in technology, figuring out how to add friends is ridiculous. I think I am now my own child with multiple personalities (now 3 self accounts) on here and asking myself to approve myself.",
"Great app in terms of parental control, but when you have multiple kids they can't access on the same device - there's no way to log a child out and another in. So you can only set up for one child per device - a problem when you've got 3 kids and one phone!",
"It's good, it wont let me get a picture from my gallery for my profile picture. I also would prefer if it had more of the customizations that the regular version has.",
This app is more difficult to use than most message apps. I got a notice that I received a message from my grandson but can't seem to actually get to the message easily. I appreciate security but what good is it if I can't actually reach my little loved ones...,
"I love this Messenger SO much more than the regular one! So many fun customizations. The only complaint I have is that you can't react to individual comments, like you can in the other app. Otherwise, I'd much rather use this one over the other one!",
"Terribly designed app, calls randomly decline with no explanation and have awful audio quality, texts don't give notifications 90 percent of the time and gifs can be clicked in close succession to easily spam.",
"I love this app SO much, one time I tried to send the poop emoji to one of my friends to be funny, but it wouldn't let me because I don't think it's ""appropriote"" for kids on this app I guess. But over all I give this 5/5 stars!!",
This app has been wonderful for my child to stay in touch with classmates during this pandemic. But please for the love of God. When the phone is on silent and do not disturb why does your app still send notifications. That really really needs to be fixed.,
"I have one problem. the app overall is very good. but why is there only video chat. if there is video chat, shouldn't there be voice calls too. sometimes I just want to talk and not show my face. so you should definitely add voice calls. please reply to this.",
"It's nice that my kids can talk to family and friends through this app, but it would also be nice if they had access to changing the chat colors and Emojis as well. Also, my kids can send me gifs and stickers, but I can't send them back. Why?",
"I hate this app!! The call quality is SO BLURRY and irritating!! Plus the filters are SO CRAPPY, it prob only took 5minutes to make the filters, the adult filters are way better! I can't even pick a profile pic from my phone! And Everytime I'm on a call it just kicks me out and the call HANGS UP and also you can't add nicknames and it is so STUPID. Plus, messenger kids takes up SO MUCH SPACE on my phone and BOGS it down, the only reason I don't use Snapchat or adult messenger is cuz my PARENTS!",
"On my daughter's device (Samsung Galaxy A01) the explore thing doesn't show up so she can't access games even though it works on my device (Samsung Galaxy A10). I tried uninstall/reinstall, clearing cache & data, and updating but it didn't fix it.",
I can communicate with my daughter back and forth it's fine. And she can also communicate with her family members all by herself and a couple of her school friends. And I'm able to monitor to make sure conversations are in her age range. I love this app !!!üòä,
"This app is amazing, I can easily talk to my friends and family in 3 simple steps. turn my phone on, press on the app, and choose who I want to talk to... It's that easy, I hope you have a good experience just like me. :D",
Amazing! But I think the kids should have stories so that their family can see what they are up to. Sometimes my nieces will send me pictures and it's not that I don't want to see their pictures and what they are doing but they send soooo many. So if the kids had stories then I could see what they are up to on my own time.,
Can you please change the fact that the I want the old ones back from like 20 2017 four 2018 2019 the old ones back I mean like squeeze these filters right now in 20 20I don't like them because they make my face look weird and I want the dog filter like animals from a long time ago those ones are really pretty and maybe I might delete this rate of 4 out of 5 and give you a 5 out of 5 does that sound good change the filters back to the that you had one that you had when you made this pretty pls.,
"I got issue on the app. It logged me out and when I log back in its just a loop hole of the login thing. It's annoying me SO FIX IT. I am mad like, I thought Facebook was making billions. Yet you can't fix this problem? Fix it already it's annoying. I want my account back, DO SOMETHING.",
"Can no longer log in. Spent days trying everything possible on multiple devices, only to have the same problem as everyone else lately, with no options for help! Was awesome for kids to be able to speak to family with ease, but not anymore.",
Reason for the 4 stars is bc i think it should be more like our messanger we have all these cool filters and my daughter does not when we chat also she cant give me a nik name like i can her or change colors ring tones or any of that exyra stuff i thoight she would be able to do like mine if all that was added and corrected this would be a perfect 5 stars i plan on lettinv her keep it for a while see how it goes im hoping you guys get this and can fix the small things missing .. Tkx,
What a great way to communicate with my daughter. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because there is no on screen pop up when she receives a message so unless her mother reminds her she doesn't remember to check and it can be days before I talk to her to remind her of my daily messages.,
"I wouldn't even give it 1 star at this point. It logged me (the parent) out several days ago. It sends me one time passwords, has my account listed, I changed my password, uninstalled/reinstalled.. Nothing. Can't log in. Reported the problem with no response.",
"This app is the best! I use it a lot. It's not just texting, you can have a pet play games, choose filters. Send gifs, send stickers, and make groups! This game is really good especially for during this quarantine! I REALLY recommend this app. Install it!",
"I like this app! My 5 year old son loves it! The only thing about it is when he trys change his favorite color, it says "" Failed to update your favorite color"". So I like this app but I think that needs to be improved.",
"I like this app, it accomplishes its goal, but I wish it would support the Emoji Kitchen from GBoard. It would be good for me to be able to express my true combined feelings. Overall, good messaging app for kids.",
I love it but pls add frames for the texts bcuz I would really like it. And I feel safe when I use it cuz you can't talk to bad people bcuz parents have to accept the contacts first also pls add nicknames so if your friend calls you nicknames they can put it but make it so it makes it not inappropriate pls also this is a kid that basicly swallowed a dictionary,
"I like it but, I'm not a little kid. Me and my friends think you should put more stuff for older kids. Also, some people in my family don't HAVE Facebook so I can't connect with them. People like my grandmother and grandfather, My aunt and uncle! I'll still use the app but I think I'll use hangouts more often.",
"This app is amazing. It can help kids talk to their friends who don't have phones. This app is so much fun and I love the little games and the funny filters that they included. This is definitely a five-star app and I love it. This app is funny, entertaining, and easy-to-use.",
Cute app with lots of options for kids to do fun things. I wish they'd add more missions because there's only like 2 or 3. Just a suggestion. Otherwise it's a fun app to install and I recommend for kids! üßÅ,
"I think Messenger Kids is awesome, I can chat with friends or call them whenever I want, but I would've given it a ""LOVED IT"" but my friend has this Coloring game in there and sends me Some pictures, but I kept trying to get it.. and it Even showed a ""UPDATE"" then I updated Messenger Kids, and Then I go onto Messenger Kids and Its still not there..",
"After two reinstalls I cannot get this app to send me notifications on time. It also won't load video and won't even run calls. Wanted to talk to my nephews, but it's useless.",
"It's a really good app for talking to my friends. The only problem is that when a video is sent, you cant save the video to your gallery.",
"It's impossible to complete some tasks, but still it's a good app. I have the regular texting app on my phone but some of my 10 year old friend ""Aren't allowed to have a phone number"" so I have to use this",
The app has a bug. We uninstalled as it was not working but we can't reinstall either as it just keeps asking for Facebook log in details over and over again. I have a very disappointed child.,
"I really like Messenger Kids.  My kids right now are a couple hours away from me at their Grandparent's house and they're too young for social media, but Messenger Kids lets them talk to me constantly directly from their tablet and I control who they talk to, and I can view their chat logs. It's really neat. I do not like some of the functions or limitations within the app directly but I know there are lots of safety measures in place that are appropriate. I wish there were a way to to delete individual messages, and other small minor complaints like inability to send them .gifs right now, but over all this app does everything you want it to! My kids are having a blast with it and that's what I'm grateful for!",
I love this app and it has been working great ever since I got it but recently the tap filters haven't been working when I'm on a call but when i take a photo or video it works. Please fix this Messenger kids! And now links no longer work for anybody I know. Messenger kids please fix these problems soon!,
I would like to see more parental controls. I would like to be able to limit which contacts get texts and video chat. Or different hours for different contacts. Kids don't understand some of the nuances of how different people prefer to communicate.,
I love they app but one thing I dislike is the fact that I cant call my friends or family it says that I need to do something today in setting's but when I gO to setting's it's not there so frustrating üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†üò°although I also don't like the fact that you can't delete messages it's not as frustrating üòë it is a PRETTY GOOD APP other than that.,
So Happy Apps & Google are creating Safe places & ways for our children to use technology. So much better than when my kids were young it was scary & couldn't allow them to do much now my grandkids can have fun while being safe & I have more control And peace of Mind. Thank You Facebook for protecting Our Children. If you're as protective as I am this App Is good!!,
It is very easy to set up all of the limitations I need to to make me feel that my child is experiencing a filtered version on the world. Dipping her toe in but still keeping up with the world.,
I've never had any problems with the Messenger Kids App. It has actually been a heaven sent since my son and I live in a different state from my main family. Recently due to the stay at home order I purchased my son a labtop because his Lexia and IXL Apps don't work on his tablet. Unfortunately I was unable to download the messenger app for his new device. That is something that should definitely be fixed.,
"Kiddo turned 13, but unlike Google we cannot find any information on how to turn her account over to her control now that she is allowed to control it herself. Can't even find info on how to link it to a Facebook account if she creates one, nor is there any contact info to get assistance. Seems like a huge oversight. Ps, I had to download the app to leave this feedback, despite not needing the app to use the functionality of messenger kids",
"Since it's impossible to contact customer service. My child is receiving my messages through her kids app. Anyone else having this problem and know how to stop it? I've logged her out, unistalled the app, logged back in and she's still getting my personal messages.",
"its an amazing app for kids! all you have to do is get your parents to sign in to their face-book accounts so they can monitor you, and you can get started you can text call and chat your friends or even family members that have messenger you can take your profile picture , take silly photos, and play fun games in your list or even with your friends when on a call! love this app I highly recommend",
Giving this a single star because I really want to use this app but it won't allow me to create my child's account. I have tried on many different devices. Samsung and Apple. I have contacted support several times and still nothing. Failure on yalls part.,
"I have heard about this app and I think that it is a really good app. My cousin had this app and it seemed to work perfect on her device. However, when I tried to download it, I had a lot of issues. It said that I couldn't make an account for some reason, so I tried again later. It still didn't work. All in all, I think it is a really great app, but may be hard to make account for some users.",
"This app was great for a short while but now my kids constantly need me to ""fix it"" because it just STOPS WORKING. it always comes back with the error message unable to send on the messages. What is the point in having an app to communicate with family if they can't communicate with family! Now its not sending messages because ""the sleep mode is on"" its outside of the time frame and it is Sunday and the sleep mode that is affecting it is for friday and saturday! Please fix this!!!!!!",
"I have 2 children I would like to have this app, but it will only give me access to Child #1. When I click add account it only gives option to add account under Child #1 (meaning he'd have 2 accounts) versus adding entirely new account for Child #2. I keep approving same request OVER & OVER again. It constantly ask for my FB email & password but continues to say no account found. After about 5 tries, it somehow finds me! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è FRUSTRATING!!!!",
"After installing this app...my Facebook account has been messing up. I can no longer see any photos and worse I can't Uninstall Facebook or the messenger, only ""disable"" it. I want it off my devices COMPLETELY!!! üò°",
"This is a great app beacuse it is fun, useful, and just an amazing app. If I could change one thing about it though I would change if it could be used without wifi. I know this would be HUGE but just think of how much more useful and better the app would be. Thank you sooo much for making this appüòÅ",
"I wanted to download this app on my daughters phone. I can't log in, it says that her phone does not have internet signal and please try again. Well I have done everything from deleting the app and downloading it, restarting the phone, and checking her signal. we both have unlimited data and I can open every other app and even watch a movie on Netflix but can't login here. dumb.",
"I just installed the app to let my daughter talk to her friends, but it constantly keeps telling to to do this ""verify your an adult"" It's like I've been put in a loop. If I could rate it lower I could. The app sucks!",
"App is great aside from the fact that there is no time stamp. Your unable to go into messages from the parent controls, and cant ""mute"" the app for the child. Theres also no way to remove the option for them to make group chats on their own.",
Its an AMAZING app definently recomend only down side is it keeps saying messenger kids is stopping but its never done that before i probably need to update but overall AMAZING no ads what so ever you can use filters connect with your friends and play games! definantly recomend downloading,
"When I logged in, I pressed the ""Not now"" option and accidentally closed it out. Then, When I reopened the app, It said ""Logging out..."" I didn't think much of it so I re-logged and it said ""Failed to find accounts"", Did it somehow log me out of Facebook? Or what? 1:38PM Now I have finally gotten to the ""Things we want you to know"" screen, I read through it and pressed ""Create account"" .... ""Failure account creation"" I retired multiple times and it still didn't work.",
"Great app! But you need to bring back the pet and it always says when I'm trying to change my color ""app failed to change favorite color"" pls fix this. But other than that good app for kids 6-10",
I love that my daughter can enjoy video calls with grandparents and other family members especially during quarantine. This app is amazing as it doesn't contain any ads and it's super kid friendly.,
It's amazing I love it. I have my friends on there and I love chatting with them,
"Messager kids is very helpful, but it isn't letting me log back in even though my parents have put in their emails and passwords many times. If you can fix this bug it would be very helpful.",
I keep trying change the theme i go into profile but its not and this isn't the only issue i get with this app because i keep trying to into my account but it doesn't let me also i had to reset my phone twice because it wouldn't let message my friend at all i don't know if the last thing i mentioned was just my phone or something but it REALLY ANNOYED ME! I also have to say I've read tons of the other complaints and i see you haven't done anything about them please change this stuff No adds tho,
This app is a good app because me as a kid I am worried about having the wrong nomber or getting bad messeges but on messenger kids I do not have to worrie and my mom or dad can control who I talk to so I do not get mean or bad messeges and it has fun games and funny filters you can use when you take a picture and you can you can facerime and text fun and easy!.,
"My daughter enjoys this app a lot, but the constant notifications are exhausting. I know I can turn them off, but I would rather just be able to turn them on and off for certain people rather than as a whole.",
This app has been helpful with my kids connecting with their peers and family members. But have had issues where they will randomly call people multiple times... If new to this app install to a parent controlled device like ie moms/dads phone. Would recommend the call option be removed from kids messenger. And just leave it so they can text.,
Whenever I send a text it never goes through until a long time. Can you also fix the glitch where someone sends me a load of photos and I can only see one. Fix these and I would leave 5 star,
"Cannot delete messages that your child sends before the other party sees the messages. You can delete them for your kid, but not the other kid. So, I switched my kids to telegram and set up as much privacy as possible.",
"I couldn't even use the app! I tried making an account for my kid and it kept saying ""error, can't make an account"" then I 'exceeded the amount of times' I could make an account. I linked it with mine, but then my kid could see ALL of my messages and I couldn't use any of the parental controls to make it so she couldn't see my messages. I tried messaging Messenger Kids to ask for help, and no response. Thanks a lot....",
"I really liked it at first, but ever since the update that removed parents ability to allow or restrict gifs and web links, it's become frustrating. It seems silly to complain about. But I used to send educational links to my kids and I can't now.",
"Safe app for kids! She's 4 and talks to family. I control everything from my phone, & I'm the only one that can add anyone. We recommend this! You can disable anything you would like. No one can delete messages they've already sent to kids messenger!",
Everytime i try to log in it says an error occured. Even when i can finally get in a few months later my account expires and when i try to log in it plays the stupid error occured game.,
Used this app for several years but now we can't sign in because of as never ending loop which just signs you out. It's been like this for 2 months and we can't fix it. Used to be okay but now it's not even working.,
"Problem: someone will send two pictures in one message. I will tap them. When I tap the second one, however, it only displays the first one. Please fix this.",
"Editing to say i first wrote this June of 2021 and it STILL is not resolved! This is March of 2023. I never get notified when my daughter messages me. Why won't notifications work...this has been a longstanding issue that I cannot resolve. Please, help.",
I love it i use it every day to talk to my friend (btw im on my dads acc) i would really like to go in a app and still be able to see the call like on netflix theres a little box i would love that bc if im playing a game with my friend and they want to show me something i have to get out the game im playing then look so pls add this.,
"So here's what happened I was setting up the account and when I was done and then pressed the ""create account"" button for some reason it said something went wrong so then I checked if I was missing any information to set up the account nothing was missing so I pressed the button again yet it still said something went wrong so I am asking anybody if you could please help me with this situation please and thank you üòÅ",
"It works, kind of.. My son and I don't get any notifications from the app even though they're turned on so he doesn't know I texted him unless he checks. The app is also glitchy and most of the kids games don't work",
I love it but every time I try to make a vid it says a can't but other than that I love it it's nice to talk with friends but there are some glitches in the vision calls but they aren't a problem just a little annoying,
I love the app except for the adding part. You can't add anyone unless their parent is on your friend's list. If your kid has their code I think You should be able to be able to be add Them without having there parent on your Is parents Friends List.,
"It's great but my bff can't click like in the mini games. Even after restarting her phone countless times and even like shutting down her phone it uninstalled everything, SHE STILL COULDN'T CLICK!!! Pls fix this",
"A couple of things. 1 why does a kids app need to be bogged down with the incessant games? 2 if my child is using another app on the tablet he doesn't see a call come in from whomever, and he won't see a notification so he can call them back.",
"Feeling very frustrated, trying to add my daughter grandma and it keeps saying error. Wr tried sending the request, her grandma tired to send us the request and both ways it's just hot working and reads error. Please fix this!",
There is this bug where the screen blacks out for a seconds then comes back again but if i go at the right angle it doesnt happen its just an annoying bug fix it now.,
I love this app! It is so nice to have because I have friends that live 11/12 hours away and I can still contact them without a phone number + it's easy to use and has fun games! ‚ù§Ô∏è,
Just bought a samsung tab 6 and it will not load my son's account. I tried everything and it just fails to log him in. What is the fix? He had this installed on an iPad and it was working fine although it was a 10 year old ipad.,
"Ok, I get notifications now, but WHY THE HELL DOES MY SCREEN TURN OFF EVERY 2 SECONDS? This is meant for kids, so that's just bad! Oh & don't tell me it's only me, cuz then how come my gf has it happen to her too? She has an iPhone & I used to, both devices do it, as well as this MOTO, so it's not just a brand surprisingly for Apple.",
"I would rate this a 5 but when I call people and play a game with them and I cover my camera slightly my screen goes black, the issue isn't my phone Its messenger and I need this fi x Ed it's annoying!!!!!!!",
It's a really good app and the filters are adorable and all but it randomly signs me out of my profile and when you need to tap a filter mine doesnt work so it's kinda hard to use them but overall pretty good,
"App Broken. My daughter's account won't log in and after several months, the authentication keeps getting stuck right after I verify my permissions. The app won't work on any device, between a Galaxy S9, Galaxy S23 Ultra, and a Kindle Fire.",
"i love this app! it gives so much fun times! my friends moved to floirda an now i can contact them with thi app, and im living in misouri so its extra great! i just love chating and calling my friends. and even doing small minigames to pass the time.",
"It's a great app. I love the funny faces, I can play games with my friends, and the growing pets feel like a house has a pet. Also, you should make a voice call.",
This is a great app for everyone the only problem I have is that when you get disconnected your video freezes and I hope that messager kids will let the kid know that the person who they are talking to got disconnected but this app is great for me and my sister and everyone,
"Hi, I am a 13 year old girl who tried to use this app. My mother tried setting it up and it kept saying ""Account Creation Failure! Please Try Again"". She kept doing it over and over but it just wouldn't work. Please fix it immediately.",
I love this app it helps me tell my mom cuz I have a sister and she's annoying and she is sometimes very bad and it's harder for me to just go into my mom's room so it's easier for me to tell her when I use this app and I really like the filters they're fun to play with ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,
Most Awesomest app ever created for kids that let them communicate with their friends and it's highly easy to set up to. I highly recommend.,
"I tried to sign in and it said account creation failure, I tried again after re-opening the app, it still said it, nothing else to say since I can't create an account.",
this app is so fun!!! but you can only do so many filtters on my phone it says that i cant do my fav filter pls fix the bug so fun and kid friendly also if your child says a bad word it removes the app i think its awsome!!!!,

"Something is wrong with this... I keep on trying to make a account but it just doesn't let me, I've tried four different ways but it just never works, really disappointed and I hope you do something about this soon...",
"I'm a fellow teenager and this app is very good, but I have a Idea for your company. Messenger teen! It's like messenger so you can add friends without asking but it alerts your parents who you add and the adults can watch your conversation. I think it would be a cool app so teens with strict parents can still have some freedom while still being safe! It would be cool so please think about my idea",
Messenger kids is great I can call and video chat with my friends and family it's just amazing and so awesome I don't know what I would do without it it's just like when I want to FaceTime somebody they it's like it's not bad it's amazing and sometimes I have trouble but it's still so so so amazing I love it so much messenger kids is the right way to go. üòç If you have kids and give it to them like let him have this if they ask for Messenger kids or if they said mommy can I get Messenger kids.,
"Does not work to play the games or filters or anything. I'm trying to connect with my niece and play games with her but it does not work on my end. With either messager app, kids or regular. üò™",
Hola I like this app because it's really easy to use and I it's made it very easy because it makes you can talk to family in a little bit even report things you can your child can block your other childrand they can report it and I feel like it's A safer environment and it's practice for when they go get their Phone and Facebook it's Instagram and all of that it's very good practice to think it's not OK like you can report things in block people and that's what I lik e,
"Good for the kids to chat, but you can't delete messages at all. Which after a cpl of years chatting. It's seriously taking up space. I've messaged (msgKids)many times and have no answer.",

"This app needs a dark mode on android asap. this is horrible. This app is supposed to be for kids, which it is, but I don't want to have my child coming to me saying their eyes are hurting because the screen is not very dark at night. Please add a few of the features that iOS users have. This world is so not fair when it comes to technology!",
It helps to send photos text and have calls and video calls you can play games with friends and family Evan in different house hold you add people with code to remember you can block people when needed parents will need Facebook email for this parents can choose to let kids add who ever they want or have them selves have accepted who they add,
"I love the messenger kids app a lot, but one problem is the new update. I can't customize or change the color of what I want my app to be. Is it the type of device I have? I have an s22 ultra.",
I'm not able to log into my child's messenger. It keeps saying login failure. On multiple devices. There's no reasoning. This needs to be fixed.,
"This app is okay. Every time I try to call my cousin all that happens is ""connecting"", and when that happens it's super frustrating. Please fix this.",
"Great app besides Android has missed out on 2 OR MORE UPDATES. Fix your app. I JUST FOUND OUT OF ANOTHER UPDATE WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE THEMES. UPDATE THE ANDROID ONE. Update one year later, and I now have an iPhone. I no longer use messenger kids anymore so this doesn't concern me.",

GARBAGE!!! I can login online just fine. Every time I try to login through this app it tells me there is a problem.,
"JUST DUMB! So many stinking regulations. You can't delete texts you have sent either. I hate that. Then, their is the dumb things they always try to make you send, like ""funny"" photos or questions that are just lame. Then there is the Gay pride stickers all over the place. They just are everywhere! And, they don't have an option for hiding them!",
I love messanger kids i can finally talk to my friends after school it is so fun there is no flaws in messanger kids it is the best i love it i also love the amazing filters and games there is more than just messanging wich i love,
"I love it! Although it got very slow recently, the app is amazing. But from the start, every time I got on face time, my screen was black. I could see my friends but they couldn't see me.",
Great app for kids to be in n touch with their friends specially with all social distancing situation going on right now. Works fine !! Would be great to see some more advanced features.,
"Suddenly, the kids can no longer send messages to anyone in the UK, which was the whole reason for me getting this app. There is nowhere online to get support for this - feedback gets no response. This app isn't fit for purpose because of whatever this issue is!",
I used to really like this app for my child however right now it is not working when I try to log in it keeps sending me back to the login page over and over again and telling me that it is logging me out. I need you to please fix your bugs so that I can be able to use this for my child.,
"I love this app so much, and on the weekends when you're bored, you can just text them if you can hang out. Great game so I would get it if I was you.",
"love the app. I can monitor all she does and who she connects with. one thing I would like to be able to do; is be able to do all the like, heart, sad, angry face emojis on the messages we send to each other like you can on regular messenger.",
"Good over all. My daughter loves the app, but she accidentally deleted all her games and apps now the app will not let me sign back into my account. Not even on my phone. Not happy. Just continues to send me to login......Pulling my hair out now getting ready to delete the app.",
Great app I love how it enables me to talk to my family and that I like how it I'm able to like make groups I only have like two problems with it it's not the first problem is that we had a very popular group on it but for some reason his we stopped like talking on it for a while it got deleted so I had to make like part 2 of it and my second thing is that I used to be able to do like all of the fun filters and stuff like the app says you can do but then it just didn't let me use the filters,
I can never see the pictures my friends send me.,
"Trash. Garbage & useless. It doesn't matter who invites, how, or when. The app just restarts. Also, when it states at the very beginning it ""..will not create an account.."", but then immediately follows up with, ""by clicking create account, you agree..."", is just ridiculous. Which is it & why cannot I not just connect to my children? This is coming from a post divorced single father who's been attempting to communicate with his children on days without them. Invitations don't even work. Pointles",
"Hello, I have been trying to create an account. However when I click ""create account"" it says ""Account creation failure"" I really want this fixed. I have been trying to create an account for about 30 minutes. I have been trying not to throw my device across the room (due to anger issues.) May you please fix this? It's annoying..",
This is a really good app.i use it to chat with my freinds that i cant see during covid-19.and its really fun for kids(i would know im 9)and why its really fun is because it has little games you can play with freinds and family and take funny photos. But i would say its a little glitchy.but overall it safe fun and just a really good app.,
This app allows younger kids talk to there friends and their parents. It allows lost of different stuff. U could play a drawing game and send ur picture to a friend and have them guess what it is. There isn't just filters but there is little games you can play with you and who ever you are talking to on call. It's kind of like a discord to because u can close the app and go into another app while u are still on call. THIS APP IS WONDERFUL,
I love the app for my child. I have full control of who to add in her contacts. I can see all the activities she's doing as it is linked with my phone. I think its a safe app. Just always monitor your child with any technological device. And watch what they type.,
"This app was great, but like so many others, we can no longer log in. It's stuck in the ""parent acct verification"" loop on multiple devices. My kids are extremely disappointed!",
"Won't let me login. Keeps asking me to authorize the device. I put my password in. It brings me back to authorize device. Just keeps going and going like that. I see that I'm not the only one, based on other reviews. Needs to be fixed!",
"My daughter is not ready for a phone at this point, however, with kids messenger I'm able to monitor who she talks to and contact her whenever I need too. It's super convenient and gives me peace of mind. I like that the oarent/guardian has to approve who is trying to contact their kid.",
"The messenger app won't allow my daughter to play games with her friends, she is unable to grow her pet, she can't share songs with them. It just shuts down completely without warning. We have the most rent download/updates and it persists.",
"This app is highly recommended for a way to communicate with your child. The call quality is great, the games are exciting to play, and it even let's you pick a background color. I use this to talk with family and friends and it works. The filters are even fun. I highly recommend this for parents, friends, and children.",
I am a kid using this app... I really enjoy this app but one thing I want to improve on this app if its possible to make it so you can get notifications that show the person's face instead of it just being their name. Other then that it's a good app I recommend this app for younger children,
"It sucks so much, I can't connect my headphones to it, I can't turn off my camera when I'm in a call and I can't get pictures for my profile picture from my gallery. Honestly the last one isn't that bad it's the first two that really bother me.",
"The messages take some time to send but that's not the MAIN problem. The main problem is how the online and offline stuff is so confusing, it would say my friends online when they're not, or it'll say they're online the to click on it and it says 'online 10 minutes ago' can you fix this?",
This app would be a 5 star except for the fact that I can't add people that aren't either a Facebook friend of mine or have the messenger kids app themselves with a code. My daughter's father is not a FB friend of mine as we are not together. So I can't add him to her contacts and make him a manager. Please please fix this!,
This is amazing! I can text my friends and no number needed. Nobody can get my personal information. Parents can see who you are texting and what you are texting. I feel secure and safe when I use this app. Great job!,
"It is an amazing app. I get to talk with my friends and play games. If haven't already, you should really get it. It is clean and fun and it is perfect for kids who are bored during Clovid-19 and want to socialize with friends without risking exposure.",
Super irritated with this app. I tried months ago & it wouldn't work. Just tried again & it will not create an acct for my child. I've even tried making her younger than she is & still nothing. I can't find any reason that would go against FB guidelines. Yet I'm not given a reason why it will not allow me. How can I fix something when I don't know what the issue is.,
"Great safe experience. Made a fake account for my oldest, so she could talk to family members, now we use this for all 3 kids. I understand the safety feature, but I really hate that I cand send silly gifs to my kids, but they can use the gif search feature, to send them to me. They get upset that I ""cant send them funny pictures.""",
Hi and first of all i don't know how to open this app. It says it will download it for me soon. But I waited for a long while and it's still not downloading it for me. I can't really rate it because i have not used it yet but for now it will just be three stars. Google play just does not work for my PC.,
Love the app. I just wish there was a way to disable video chat my son keeps calling people and hanging up. We tried to disable camera in app settings but he can just easily turn it right back on when he hits the video chat button.,
The best you can call people but sometimes it doesn't work because sometimes it gets you off connection and one time you're my friend couldn't hear each other makes her about voices so different but otherwise it's the best game ever and like I mean like the games on it especially the best app ever since you can type your family or friends your cousins your neighbors everyone it's actually very fun because I don't spend time with my neighbor that much and I have her message kids,
i think messenger kids is a great app for kids to use to talk to their friends. me and my younger sister use it and it is so easy for her to call and text her friends. the only thing i would like added is more colours for your text colour ü§™,
"Should be ZERO STARS. I am having the same issue as many people: Unable to log in. It keeps going back to find your account. It's disappointing that the problem persists and yet FB has DONE NOTHING, provided NO INFORMATION and doesn't respond to anything. FIX IT!!",
"I recommend this app to all parents. It provides a summary of all the time my child had, with who and what activities they did. I was surprised that it informed me immediately about any concerning content in videos or photos.",
"this app is great, and my kids love it, however I am the controlling parent therefore it is my Facebook account that controls her app, I havent been able to figure out how she can call me, as there is no way for me to add myself and I dont appear on her contact list.",
Have downloaded this app for my children and it USED to work perfectly. However recently i enbaled the sleep mode function where the app is supposed to lock and unlock at a certain time however it wont go into sleep mode! Very frustrating.,
This is great when your stuck at home in covid and when you want to chat to your friends! But your friend's parent has to have Facebook. Also it is very glitchy in calls but still a very good game to have.üôÉ Hope you download the game üòÖüòÖüòÖ,
"My daughter has lots of fun talking to her friends and sending pictures and playing games with then!The games on messenger kids are fun for all ages and are lots of fun for kids!She can talk to her friends and family off the Island and stay close to them!She can make plans for playdates and other stuff without her parents help!Us parents can see and control your childs contacts and see what there saying!My daughter and I love messager kids she has so much fun! Thank you, Lyle Smith",
"it bans for no reason sometimes, it it glitchy most of the time, but other than that it's a really good app for me and my friends to use when schools out for summer break, because most of them dont have phone numbers for facetime.",
Anytime I try to enter my password I cannot get in. I'm getting message alerts from regular messenger telling me I have texts coming into this app but I cant see them and I have the exact password. I'm frustrated that I cannot log in. I am not a parent but my niece sends messages to all her family members through this app. I need help,
"This app freezes off and on when my daughter is using it. Even when we are not on it, a message pops up saying, ""messenger is not responding."" She has a Samsung phone and most apps have worked.",
You should really get this app it's so fun they get you new filters everyday at least and you get to text with all your best friends and there are cool games on it and you click the rocket ship and then it'll show you some games and then you can also make a video with music playing in the background and send it to your friends and you can video chat and it is so much fun you should get it! You also can text with family members!,
They need to add more filters but it's still perfect,
im telling you this app is amazing!! ur kids will love it.,
"This app is really great but there is one problem that I have with it. It wont let me send messages after 5 minutes and is getting annoying. Other than that, great app I love it!",
this app is great i can talk to friends when times like this so you and kids can have have fun all the time at there own house. Also if you get off the app without ending the call you can still talk to each other so your kids or you can play games and talk. That's how a good calling app should be.,
"First no present screen button as this would be good if you were playing fortnite on mobile and you wanted to share the screen. Last, there is OBVIOSLY no ads but I need internet because I am on phone but all of my other friends are on iPad and they dont need internet. I want an update that's like only 4 mb and that you dont need internet to text people. Otherwise Great app!",
I like the app a little bit but the app is a little bit glitchy,
It's so much fun! I'm so happy I can text my friends! My one friend moved away but now I can text her! This is the best texting app EVER!! The filters are funny too! and I like that you can play drawing games with your friends! I can also text my parents! I'm glad that they have healthy habits too.,
I love this app so much! I would recommend this app to kids and parents! Just one problem is when the phone rings it is constant!!! I wish it had a silent button. Otherwise its a awesome app I have to say.,
"This is nice but this app is just a crappy version of Messengers. If Facebook wants to make this better, they could 1 Make it so you can set your pfp as a photo from gallery 2 make the filters better quality 3 Also i sometimes dont get notifications when someone texted me, 4 & also make it so when you touch a picture in a chat that you can scroll through the other pictures too. Ill still be using the app & I hope Fb realizes that just because they are kids doesnt mean they deserve a crappy app",
This app will NOT let me allow video chat when i keep spaming the allow button it just will not let me allow it.Idk if you should get or not.I will re-install it ONLY if they fix this problem.,
"hi I have been using messenger for a years now and this is what i use when i want to message my friends, classmates etc. but last night it just suddenly appeared ""no connection"" though we have strong WiFi internet connection till now I'm struggling to figure out how can i take the messenger back, but still didn't worked even though i searched so many vids on YouTube, still can find a legit method that can fix the messenger please try to reach out to someone who has the same problems as me.",
This app so amazing! I have never seen such a good app.My mom dosent let me have texting apps that adults use so she only lets me use this and i am happy about that. Its kind of like snap chat in a way because you can put on filters when you video chat with people. I like that you can decorate pictures because i love decorating. There is really no reason not to install this app. And parents if you are reading this i think your kid will have the same expirence that i did.üòÄüòÄüòÄ,
"Overall, this is a okay app. But yesterday all of the sudden, I can't type on it anymore. It also doesn't give me notifications when my friends message me. Overall, its 3 stars.",
ANGRY. I've been using this app for three years. To update it it was 355 mb. It didn't update and it's exactly the same. My friends updated and it was amazing. I uninstalled Spotify and dumb ways to die just to update and it did nothing do better Facebook,
Its not bad app i use the app very often and luckily for me i havent had the problem many people have i have had my account for just over 1 year now and i have over 10 friends overall its a good app my few problems are; the filters aren't reallly the best thing in the world they could honestly be better also i dont really like the new update its not as fun and colorful as it used to be you now you cant decorate the app or set an emoji anymore wich kindof makes the app a bit more boring,
It is a great way for my daughter and son to keep in contact with their freinds during covid 19. It has many things to do it even has a tictok thing on it where you can dance to music and send it to freinds. And parents can see what they do useing their phones and seenif they post or text anything of a picture or video to their freinds.,
"Better than Regular Messenger! It's simple, easy to use, and not too closely associated with your Facebook account. I only wish Facebook made a version this simplistic for adults. When I have kids if Facebook is still around, this app will be a definite must have.",
"This app is amazing for my kids to socialize safely with her friends. Although the colors are hard to choose from, maybe add more colors to the color selection? Even though, y'all did great on making this app",
"It lets me have alot of accessibility as I get to customize. Yes, I would recomend this to a parent for there child but it does take some time to get people to be able to chat with your kids so be prepared.",
Amazing app defiantly recommend for kids so that their safe and you know it. sends you notifications when they want to add a new friend and also when they are receiving and sending messages. Totally recommend and nice and fun for your kids,
"I give messenger a 4 star because I think kids messenger is good but... u guys should add a story where kids can post what they did today but only if they want to. also I can't save vids and that really annoys me. and all I want is cuter and more filters... ye that's all I'm asking from you kids messenger, but don't worry I do love kids messenger I think it's like really cool though. Thank u for making an amazing app like this but I do recomend these changes plsss!!!!‚ù§üòéfrom bestie!!!!!!!!!!!!",
"I'm a Canadian living in China, I'm logging in through the US with a VPN and yet ""the app is not available in your country"", with no clue as to which country it's talking about. I'd appreciate a little help here. Thanks.",
"Login is broken on Android. Also when logged in, it seems to require you to be actively using it to receive messages. Also the first time I attempt a video call it says Internet connection required and then works the next time.",
I tried to open the app. and when I try to open it the screen turns white and crashes and is taken off the home screen. then when I go to the app store it says update. so I up date it and thought that fixed it. but when I see it again it just says uninstall instead of open and/or uninstall.,
"I love Messenger Kids because it gives you the freedom to talk to your friends and family whenever you want and most of the time wherever!!! Love, Chen",
It does what it does but not really tablet friendly. Screen will automatically rotate to portrait mode even when tablet is in landscape mode.,
"the emojis on the app aren't that great. cant even put a poop emoji because its ""inappropriate"" this app sends me messages all of the time saying I sent something inappropriate and it was automatically deleted. so I do not use this app anymore.",
I can't even set up an account. It keeps saying something about a failure and something went wrong creating my child's account. My mom just wants to video chat with my kids during the week. We don't have iOS devices and my mom is familiar with messenger so this seemed like a good option for everyone. Please fix this problem.,
"This is a great app and I love that I can monitor my child's interactions, however I wish that the parent account could send gifs, links, etc to their child.",
i just downloaded this app and everytime i go to. open it says an error has closed unfortunately stopped working. then i read the reviews and someone on dec 24 said it just updatef and now wont work. i was really excited about using this app. i wonder if i can uninstall updates in app settings?,
I love this app but the reason I'm giving it four stars is because it has new upgrade which I'm not very happy about I really like it though it's just that it won't let you choose any color like before I would let you choose purple or something and then if you clicked hold them at the same time it would make it rainbow but now that it's a new messenger it has very more filters and more games so that's the reason I'm giving it four stars I would give it five if I posted this before the upgrade,
This is a great app for my kid. I hope you'd develop a Facebook for kids too with just as the same parental control/restrictions as this one. It'd be great if they can post too and interact with their friends and follow their Favorite people/interests too so they could have updates on their own safe newsfeed.,
"I'm glad I get to talk to my friends but it won't let me take a picture for my account even when I have pretty good internet connection it says it doesn't have any internet connection and all my friends have really cool pictures for their accounts but I can't, so as soon as this gets fixed 5 Stars üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü but until i get a picture on my profile 3 stars üåüüåüüåü (edit): one of my friends even took his/her picture TWICE!!! I have a picture on my profile now I just needed to use my parents phone. edit 2: i can take the picture from my own phone but the emoji filters in the video call they're DISGUSTING compared to how they were before.",
"We are having a great time with this app! It's simple, and informative. This app gives my child a sense of Independence and gives me a sense of security. He can call and video chat with me and our family whenever he wants to, and messenger kids helps me to ensure his safety.",
"Great way to keep kids in touch - however it NEEDS a way to log everyone out! My kids don't have phones so they use mine and I'm being messaged or called all throughout the day. I know you're able to switch users, but appearing offline unless I change it would save my sanity!",
"messenger kids is so great in my opinion! I can text all my friends and my family just using an app! it's really the same as messaging, but you don't need a number. Just an email and your parent just needs facebook!",
I give this app 4 star because it is an awesome way to sya in touch with friends. I didn't give it all 5 stars because when ever my friends are online and the get off the app it says they were online 3 hrs ago when the were reall online 1 min ago but that only started happening after i hit the update button. So Facebook team could you plz fix this problem.I would really love to give this app a 5 star review,
"The app is great for kids, and is very secured coz parents can check his activities. However I just don't like the cartoon. It should be at least a human or a kid. He constantly laughs at it. Please do something about it.",
Nice alternative for kids. The only thing I haven't been able to figure out is time stamping conversations. I can't see when my daughter communicated with her friend. It just gives me number of messages.,
"I would rate it 5 stars but my only issue is that when accidentally type in a message and you didn't mean to sent to you can't delete it other than that, I definitely recommend this app to anyone!",
"This is great! Maybe if u could name people stuff like on the real messenger that would be cool. Also maybe so you can make your pfp a pic from Google photos. Other then that, it great!",
App is great for kids but continually crashes when trying to authorize access to other profiles. The entire process is too cumbersome to be relevant.,
"Love it..I get to communicate with my friends for some reason, it glitches some times and i can not see my group texts..but overall i love it!! I get to call my friends that are far away! I lovee it! Its a really good app for me in my opinion, sometimes i can not here my friends and they go on a other app and i cant here them but i love it!",
If the developer fixes this ill change the rating. I've come to realize the latest update is what has messed the app up and forces it into a repetitive login loop! I'd be happy to go back to the old update if it would let me!,
I love this game there is nothing wrong definitely recommend,
You know I like this because I can message my best friend and and my parents don't have to worry I'm pretty sure there is the parents go through the contact list so they can see it like the kids are talking to a stranger or something but overall great app and I love how you can talk to your friends like I'm 9 years old and I need a phone to talk to my friend but family she also doesn't have a phone but also I don't have a phone so we can just chat at on messenger kids,
Honestly the quality of the video is really bad but it can be monitored by the parents which can be a good thing it's just the quality of the app is absolutely horrible if you have young children that want to be able to FaceTime their friends this is perfect I wouldn't install this app for anyone over seven but that's just my opinion the quality is horrible though,
"The app wont work for me, the format seems fine but whenever I press ""create account"" it keeps saying it ""can't work at the moment"". My child just wanted to communicate with her friends.",
I like how I know my kid is safe. He is happy with the fun filters and how he can talk to his friends. I give this a four star rate because this app is not wireless. My child has to confirm he has Internet access. When he has no Internet access he can not contact me when I am at my job. Messenger kids is a really good product. And that is why I gave Messenger kids a four stare rate.,
Horrible. Been trying to access the app and login with my correct information and all it says is that my account is unavailable or disabled. Makes no sense when I activated it through MY ACTIVE account. Needs a lot of bug fixes.,
Messenger kids it's a very good app there's no ads and everyday I can just call my bestie it is so much fun cuz I can't have playdates everyday cuz my mom doesn't really let me have them a lot so I can just call my friends it's not the same thing as seeing them but it's really fun at least you can talk to them I really recommend this app you can have this app if your 5 years old 6 years old maybe even twenty years old I really recommend this app please get it.,
Messages quit working follow directions clear this then that. Still didn't work. The next step said Un install and reinstall. NOW I CANT SIGHN HER IN. Log out of my account and back in to make sure it was right and it is..so I tried on another device. I put in my info looks like it will go then jumps back to login screen,
"This is a great app! There is something me and freinds really want in the app, We really want to make Custom filters, so basiclly we get to customize and create filters. Also i cant change my profile picutre to something in my Gallery, this has been bugging me for so LONG. I use a LG android phone thingy- (idk what its called) please tell me how to do it...",
I can't use it. When trying to set up the account it doesn't recognize my FB email address or phone # and therefore I can't complete the setup. Frustrating to say the least!!,
"I dont like it. At all. Im old enough to have a phone and to use a ""text messaging app"" (duh). but I choose not to have FaceBook because I dont like it. Now I have to add a FB account just so I can have an account on ""Messenger"".",
Messenger kids is goodüëç But a little glitchy..... And it kicks me out,
"Overall good experience. It would be nice if the adult version had the same filters as the kid version, my kids are always asking me to do what they are or want to do what I am with the filters.",
It works really well for texting but when I tried to call someone it crashed and shut down my phone. I heard of calling messing up certain people's phones but I almost had to delete all my data üôÅ,
"I love this app so much!!!!!!!!! I have one issue though, some of the games don't work. When u click on some of the apps they just load 4 ever. But, overall I love this app and how u message ur friends.",
A company like facebook that makes so much money and is so established. I don't understand why they have a such a hard time trying to perfect the program for children to use to communicate with people it doesn't seem like rocket science. This program is a joke it never works it cuts off on you in the middle of talking to your child or anybody you should delete and start over it's trash.,
It's good but the thing is that you can't see what's going on on their screen Like say they are doing something that they are not supposed to like inappropriate stuff that's the thing and you can't use Bluetooth for it please fix the Bluetooth,
My child really likes this as there are games and fun activities and stays connected with me and her friends... Really useful app if you often go out for some work and if you're worried about your child just tell them to stay online and you can send them messages and even voice/video call them. ‚ô•Ô∏è,
"I love this. Its so cute for the kids to chat with family members and gets them used to typing. They can send pictures with cute kid filters, cute kid stickers. Parents control who can become their friends and add their contacts for them. So far no problems with it.",
"The app is nice. My kids have it on their tablets and enjoy talking to family members, however, I wish there was a way for me to see all conversations had from my phone, instead of just friend requests and having to get their tablets to check the conversations. I like that they cant talk to people without my approval but I still want to be able to monitor what is said.",
wonderful! i can contact my friends that I don't ever see. i only have one complaint and that is their face talk. i love the idea but I will be talking with a friend and suddenly my screen goes black and I have to re-call them.,
I like it because we can chat with far away peolp! So i like this app a lot so i think you should get the app to my dotter loves to chat with her friends ! The only problem is some time's she can't see some peopel but after all it is a really good app for kids to play or text friends on so your kid should get this app! Good day bye,
"My rating is a 3. The reason why is because the kids can name the group chats anything. They can also text innaproprite words. Overall, I think this is a great app to connect with family and friends. Anyway, please fix this!",
Need more games and doodles. More questions and maybe even some Bible study or learning casts about science astronomy ... interactive stuff for their friends to enjoy doing with them in group chats. Like go outside scavenger hunt or create stuff.... Maybe a voice changer too. And a trivia or quiz game!,
Love the app for my daughter to talk to her friends safely but no blue tooth headphones will work with this app even with all settings on. Have tried multiple head phones. Headphones work with phone calls and music but not this app. Any help would be appreciated,
"I like it very much.The effects are cool and the games are fun to play especially with friends.But when new effects or games come old effects or games disappear.It also sometimes glitches and can only be fixed if you uninstall it and install it again.And sometimes it is won't let you sign up even if you enter the correct password.It says confirm that your a guardian or parent.Then I enter the email and password but then it says find your account and wants your email address,password &never stops",
"I would like this app to let me make my profile picture something from my gallery. And i dont like how I can't do games on my device. I also don't like how faces like :), :(, >:( etc turn into emojis... other than that I would really recommend this!",
"This app is absolute garbage I can't log into it at all to set it up tried my account and my wife's account. Both of which get the same error ""this user is not allowed to log into this app"". Everything I can find is just some bs about not meeting community standards which i have never been flagged one time for anything mainly because I don't post anything other that pictures of my kids or to comment on a friend's post. The Facebook app is continuously getting worse by the day.",
great app. i just wish that they got a notification when they receive a message. my daughter will message me while i'm at work & i message her back but she doesnt realize it unless she is in the app waiting for me to answer.,
This app is so much fun I love talking to all my friends and everything but then all of a sudden I I coudnt watch the videos my friends sent I even tried refreshing the app but nothing worked,
"This is a fun and safe app for kids. The only problems so far are: 1) not showing all contact when putting on multiple devices. 2) sending pics through the camera part, child keeps getting pics deleted that they said could be offensive. These are taken using the tools they provide with this childrens app. If these are things that could be offensive and possibly go against policy, perhaps they should have decided this BEFORE they included in the app?!?!",
Got this so my sons could talk to their interstate cousins.. but after adding one of my kids it won't let me add the next one saying it can't complete the request?!! I don't understand what the issue is tried signing out and back in restarting but still won't let me add my other child,
"Messenger kids is amazing, I love how they have the parent view and that you get notified. The only bad thing is that my kids says that she wished that it had video call and voice call. And I think the developer should that because then the kids who don't really wan to use there faces and deal with shyness.",
My mom found this incredibly helpful. And im in my teenage years so this app helped to control me while i was messaging. Great app. But i think it would be better if you could respond to people without having to go to the app.,
I have a glitch that I have a friend on the app but I cannot text her or even add her into a group chat. Now after removing her and then adding her again it has fixed the problem.,
I love this app! Me and my best friend are apart so this is very helpful! I have no issues at all! Maybe add some more mini games or some updates. But anyway! If you miss your friend or family this is the app for you!,
This app is amazing! My kids LOVE it so much! They use it almost everyday and talk with their friends and family! I only give it four stars because I recommend is that my kids can do multiple calls on one account because my kids share one account.,
I would like to have my kids use this to talk to their friends...but that's not what they do when we get them on. All they do is play with the filters and games...and not talk to each other....especially the younger one. I'd like to be able to turn off filters and/or games for them depending on which kid and who they are talking to.,
Added a new contact and they don't show up in her list so she can't message them. She gets a notification when the message but it won't open so she can't read it.,
It's really like a like it how was was before but now it's really glitchy and there's bugs can someone fix the bug and it won't let me add my family in it,
"Well this app is great and all but there is one problem, it unfair when parents can have the child's contact but then we have to update the app to add it. I've updated it yet it says I still have to update it. I think I you should do it straight away if the parents accept it",
"Great app but one problem. Why is it when you accidentally press the end call button it doesn't ask you ""are you sure you wanna leave the call"" like this happens to much. But overall its a good app. Please try to fix this",
"I like it, I just don't like it that much because you can't delete it, you can't delete any of your messages because your kids would be trying to delete some of their messages, and then they can't do that because of this app call, messenger kids cause they're adults have to do it or guardians, and if that was important, you can delete it, but it's just gonna be really hard for kids what if the kids have their own phone and their messaging, and their parents are like on a business trip",
My sister and I have been trying since yesterday to create account for my niece and we can't,
"I can't see ANY of the pictures my friends send me. The filters don't work on my phone, and it's all annoying. Edit: and also WHERES THE THEMES FOR ANDROID??? AND WHY WHENEVER I PUT MY HAND OVER MY CAMERA IT MAKES MY PHONE TURN OFF?? PLEASE FIX THESE MESSENGER!! PLEASE ü•∫üôè",
Its easy and fun to use it could use some more filters but over all its good for kids to connect with friends and family i Deffently suggest! Parents control who there children can talk to and kids have to ask parents to add friends and family it Deffently is child friendly! I would say its risk free!,
Since my 1st review was deleted for some odd reason. How do you expect people to use this app if you can't create an account? I've tried I don't know how many times to make an account for my little sister. It comes with the same error message every time. I'm not sure if it's a problem on end or your end. Either way it's annoying.,
Messenger kids is a really good app! I use this to chat with friends all the time and it has cute stickers you can download and stuff like that. The gifs are cute too! And all the fun activities. Overall this app is great!,
This app is excellent on talking to sisters or cousins and friends! But one thing that I don't like is when someone is talking it will just cut it off for some reason but they are still talking. Please fix this :),
"Messenger kids is a good app for kids, but It did need some upgrades, like when I get notifications it isn't until about a few hours later, and the games I think you should be able to play together, and I think you should be able to choose the sound of your Notifications.",
"It looks very nice and colorful for my daughter, but it will not allow me to sign in with my facebook account! There's a pop-up that says they had trouble signing my child in everytime I re-type my account password/email. Fix this and maybe you'll get more stars.",
This sucks my parents don't even have a Facebook like if I if they don't have a Facebook account like how am I supposed to bro I don't have a Facebook account that doesn't mean I can't go into this happened also like this too much issues like all the reviews like this is so baddd,
"Messanger kids is a great app there is a few problems though you can't call only video chat and you can't change the name of your contacts other than that the app is great you can video call, text, make group chats and its very fun!",
This is a really good app and i will give yall a good revue and when i was trying to use it it started gliching and about the colors of your text there should be mor colors and there should not be any cods and but i guess it could be safer for the kids and about the call there should be a call and a face time both buttons like on real messages and when you block someone you should not be able to umblock them. That is why i only gave yall 4 stars,
VERY CONFUSING TO USE... Figuring out who's name goes where is confusing and still don't understand how to add people to their account. Needs an update on a user friendly way to use the app...,
"Doesn't work 99 percent of the time , games don't work , calls don't work. Overall poor app , not compatible on pc for some reason ?",
"I havent been able to send videos since yesterday, everything else sends but vids and pictures. My siblings and cousins are having the same problem. My app is up to date. Please fix this and ill raise my review.",
It was good for a while and great for kids to chat but recently if I video chat I cannot see the person I'm video chatting with and the same for them and I've tried calling multiple people and it didn't work so I might raise the rating if they fix it but for now I give a 2.,
"I always call my friends on this app.But lately we have been looking for different apps because of a glitch we are experiencing. Whenever we call and play roblox,My screen flashes black and glitches me out.I KNOW it's messenger kids because it happens to her too and we have different phones.It also happens outside of roblox. 2 stars until you fix this >:(",
"I love this app I have so many people doing so many different things it is so good to learn if I learned anything new about the app but really need a few more friends. cause I don't have many in real life,it is a good app I just need them answer the call when I call and not bullie me, it's hard for me to make friendsüò™üò™",
"I love this app, you get to see and control who your child talks to, the only thing I wish was available through kids messenger is being able to send my kid emojies, for some reason is not an option in kids messenger.",
Its good it helps with playdates or just to talk with my kids friends,
Not easy to add friends for my child.,
This message app is awesome. like you can chat with you friends. Just don't send any thing inappropriate. There are also games like grow your own pet. If you don't like your old picture well you can just change it.,
"This app is really good you get to text your friends,cousins,and your family.I suppose its for 9+ only. Not only can you text but you can also play differnt games.And you get to decorate your app . What i mean by ''decorate'' is that you can chose a colour wallpaper. Oviously you need to ask a parent or caregiver. Parents also can see your childs text they sen so they are not cyber bullying, and once your child sends a messenge they can NOT delete the messenge that they send. Hope you enjoy!",
"This is pretty great. I love it! The only thing for me is, I wish you could send gifs from your gallery. I know you can send pics, but not gifs. And I wish you could use gifs and stickers from the keyboard on your phone instead of messenger kids ones, of course it should be enabled my parents.n",
Not the best. Can't log in because in isn't letting me,
"I love this app. You can draw, ask questions, and its a safe place for kids to talk. But I've been using this app now and for the past 2 days, it won't let me text but I can call. I even deleted and downloaded the app 2 times and I still caint text. Plz fix it. Tysm",
"I love the idea of being able to message my kids and having full control over who they contact. However, I would like to be a able to see their messages without installing another messenger app on my phone and be able to delete the messages.",
The app refuses to allow me to log in to authorize my kids accounts. Worked fine for a bit but stopped working. Even tried on my own phone. Whatever you did with the last update broke your app. You should get that sorted.,
I gave 3 stars beacuse when me and my best friend are talking we usually turn our videos off to play minecaft together but when my video is off and I put my finger over the front camera it turns black and when my friend does that on his end it does the same thing and this makes it very hard to play please fix this and I'll give 5 stars otherwise this app is very good to talk with friends,
"I love this app. However, I am unsure if we can upload a picture without taking it, on the camera. Also, the layout is a bit confusing for my daughter. Who is used to the vertical layout on regualr messenger lol!!",
"It stopped allowing my son to play some of the games like the egg breaking one. We deleted the app and installed again. Now it won't let me log in. Keeps going through the adult device authentication over and over. I'm really angry about this, my son use to love this app.",
Parents can't get rid of duplicate accounts for their children. Make it easier to do please?,
It's a great app but there's one problem. I have a cousin named Lori and she keeps on disappearing on my contacts. If you experience this please keep on trying to add your friend back on again üòîüò±üò≠,
"App you can do many things like video chatting texting talking with friends sending gifs sending emojis and no swears a perfect app. You can text your friends family maybe even your dogs if they're the smartest dog in the world LOL! Do you know this app is done many things for me, like spamming, having fun, and getting something to do when I'm bored thanks to the creators for making this app!",
having nothing but trouble with the app. Having trouble approving request as it is coming up on my parents page and only seeing part of the message not the full message to click on the accept button . also finding it hard to add family members,
Everytime my child tries to video chat she can not see herself only then person she is chatting with. Her screen remains black unless she takes screen shot and shes in fact able to see herself. We have tried everything from updating apps and iOS to uninstalling and reinstalling,
"It is great i can text my friends but when it says your messenger kids is asleep come back at 8 A.M. well when it is 8 A.M. i get on and text my friends but it says unable to send still in sleep mode and frusturates me so much!!! It's okay that i have to come back at 8 A.M. but if i come back at 8 A.M. then i should be able to text my friends right at, or past 8 A.M. Thats why i gave 3 stars. If you fixed the problem it would be 5 star in no time! (But still an amazing app!)",
"My mom got it for me and its very useful and fun and also i travel alot so this keeps me in touch with my friends it also needs an update, i was thinking make it so we can make nicknames and change the emoji from like to something else. And make mini games easier to acess.",
"Same issue, I got logged out and it won't let me log back in. It's just a constant loop of login information. It was great when we could use it. I hope they get this problem fixed soon",
"I had this on my kids phone and it was great. She needed a new phone and now I can't sign in. It just finds my profile and then when I put the password, it loops me back over and over again. I'm livid and annoyed.",
"should include call button, not only video call. and should allow them to add friends that aren't friends with the parent as long as parent gives approval. also should get rid of the constant reminder that someone has called, after you open that chat the reminder should go away. other than that it's fine.",
"Parent management is clunky. Cannot delete messages or contacts without hunting for the controls. Other than that, a great way for young cousins to stay in touch.",
I THINK. That this is a very awesome app. It is for kids like me I'm 9 almost 10. You can share questions pictures texts voice messages videos gifs and other stuff like that! I did a five star rate I love it. And you can get lots of freinds on this app. It's family friendly so this is my opinion hopefully someone agrees with me pleas show love and kindness to this comment. Because we don't want haters even if you don't agree don't comment back I will show love to you guys have a great day yall.,
Issues Logging In as what the latest reviews have pointed out. Asks you to authorize device and logs you out and just gets stuck in this loop. We've been using the app for quite some time with no issues but the Kid accidentally logged out yesterday and now we can't get back in.,
"Same thing. My granddaughter keeps trying to message me.  I have the app but every time I try to connect it it's not finding my phone number, email, etc.  It's  frustrating. All the while I have Facebook open and the other messenger works fine.",
"Messenger kids needs a bit of bug fixing,messenger kids sometimes doesnt show the messages you got and until a cirtain time it will show,and i dont know why.please fix this glitch.",
I love this!! I chat with my friends all day long with this but idk what is happening because It keeps stopping and my other apps but I do love it!!,
"its good althoe i cant text some people anymore and being able to search people up that you have would be very helpfull me and my brother would really like that. and thank you if you add that, i will give a better rating if added.",
"I like this app for being able to stay in contact with my kids while I'm away. The only option I feel is missing, is to delete messages. If I delete a message in Messenger, it still shows in the Messenger Kids, instead of removing the message completely.",
"It WAS a great app. Sadly though I keep getting kicked out saying ""your session expired"" I used this app for 3 years without this problem now I can't log back in. I have a friend who moved away and that is the only way I can speak to her. This app sucks.",
"Why I gave it a 2 star was because when I am on call with someone and for example goes to play Roblox. When I join a game first, it hangs up on the call. It is very annoying when that happens. That is why I gave it a 2 star. Thank you for your time.",
it was good at first but after a few years passed now all my stuff is glitchy like the filters work and everything but now all of my items and all my texting and video chatting my friends and my momthey're all going all the options are going so far I can't even reach the last filter it's so annoying fix this please Ps it's a good thing but fix it right now,
it seems like its a good app but my mom put in her email and it didn't work for some reson. she tried phone number but that also didn't work.,
"It never seemed to notify me when my nephew sent a message...kind of pointless. I can't send him links, which means that cool YouTube ""how to build a Stormtrooper helm"" vid is something I have to wait to show him. Maybe it is user error, but regular messenger didn't have that issue.",
This allows me to keep in touch with all of my grandkids! I so love this app!,
"Poor design for accessing information, flagged messages can't be interacted with to gain any useful information. Only option is to remove message or remove contact.",
"So far so good, I guess. Restricting GIFs sure sucks though. If it's a security issue, I get it, but parents should have full access to sending whatever they want or NEED, to their kids. I feel like they want to restrict third party ""GIF"" creation to get us to stay within the app, as opposed to providing any actual protection, (as the parent is established at setup)...just restrict GIFS from OTHERS, for ""safety/security"" and any ""other"" reasons (that may escape me right now since I JUST installed it yesterday.) So, just KNOW that you CANNOT send GIFS that you create yourself, from ANY other app through Messenger Kids, even if you are the parent who set it up.",
First of all there are some bugs my tablet always disconnects when I call and second when I was going into the app it was loading and loading please fix the problems,
"As a messenger kids user, I can confirm that the app is mid and I barely use it.",
"Messenger Kids is great for children. It gives you the ability of talking to friends and family on videochats and texts. It is completely safe and easy to use. Overall, I give this app 5 stars because it is amazing.",
Never got to experience. The messanger assumes that everyone uses Facebook for verification. Since no one uses facebook in the family and does not intend to in the future we never got to experience the product.,
Photo issue. Groups of photos received glitches out and you can only see the first photo of the group.,
Play with your friends is so much fun on there and in the summer you don't see him but now you do I wanted it from so bad but having your parents see what your friends text message you is safety because I really like this app cuz if somebody like says something. And you could report it or or apparent could see it and I love the little games. It's so fun you should play it,
Great for my kid he loves it he plays and takes so much pics good game thx,
I like this game because you can text people and have fun,
I had to reinstall and now I can't even login,
"This app is very good.but here l can't add anyone from Facebook or messenger after making profile and here if anyone sent me many pictures, it takes much time to show it.",
It's great but I haven't figured out if they can receive messenger calls when not connected. They received the miss call but if they are not online they won't receive it. Other than that I like it and so do my kids. Thanks!,
"Apparently the parent must have latest version of FB app. I don't want or like FB so it makes it difficult to set up for the child. The set-up asked if I wanted a code for the child, at first I declined, then tried to get it to add contacts, and can't get the code now. ...I tried switching accounts, how does one delete the acct? Uninstalling app doesn't delete info in cyberville.",
I love this app so eady to talk to your friends and child friendly it has no inappropriate stuff on it i just reallly love this app and i highly reccomend it to others! My only complain is taht it is vety glichy,
Can't get past the authorize screen. I've tried customer support and have heard absolutely nothing. Very frustrating. Really is a zero star review since we can't even use the app.,
I like messenger kids but when it tells my friends are online but they are not but another then that it is good,
5 stars but one thing is when I logged on one day I could not see any texts,
"Please allow more gifs and more stickers about anime, and i cant hear or see when someone texts or calls me. Please fix for better rating overall good app!!",
"it's a good app but when I try to make a new account, I won't let me AT ALL, and I hate that. 3‚òÖ",
My screen keeps turning black whenever I put something near it üëâüì±‚ö´ can you please fix this and can you add a feature where you can delete your messages,
You can call and text like normal messager and if you don't know how to spell a word you can just do voice messages and if you want to add someone it goes to the adult,
Awesome app I love calling my calling my cousin ü§†üòÅ I'm impressed,
Getting an error every time we try to login. It seems to be an error with many others. I would acpre higher once this was fixed.,
It's a great app but their could be some fixes like how it freezes and it takes a while to send a message. But in the end it really it a great appüòÅ,
"The ""falling asleep"" feature is very annoying. I do not know how to get rid of it and I need to schedule something with friends. Otherwise pretty good.",
I love this app it keeps me updated on who my kid talks too and when I not he with family he can call me or video chat me and even send me pics,
My kid has had a blast talking to new friends.,
Better than the messaging app because of the lag. Absolutely no lag in the app and has lots of good features,
"This is helpful for my child because I can monitor her and see who she is talking, what she is talking about talk to her and more. she has to ask me to friend someone so I can approve her she can't go behind me back",
"This app is SO stupid I out the email and password and then it said I wasn't allowed to use the app and this is the only app my friend can have as messenger, yall need to fix this app cause its not letting me on!",
Awesome app not dark mode like iPhone app,
Doesn't let you create an account and absolutely confusing and keeps going to the same screen.,
Great except for sleep mode. I don't understand why Sunday is not part of the weekend hours. My daughter is home and trying to message people on Sunday and I have to manually change the settings which is annoying. Either change it or allow parents to set each day separately? Friday and Saturday are not the weekend for my child who is in school all day Friday and I don't want her to have access on Friday mornings. Please change this and it's perfect!,
I can't do anything it like it says put in your Facebook password and stuff like that BUT I DONT HAVE FACEBOOK! It does not work on Samsung and I have Samsung! If this game would work on Samsung I'll give it 5 star. Just please help me get into messenger kids.,
"since you removed the photo to allow sending links, looking elsewhere for messaging. what's the point of a message service if not to allow you to send information like links?",
"This app was perfect for my daughter. However, she logged out about a week ago and we are unable to log back in. Like many have already described... upon logging in I am immediately logged out and rerouted back to the device authorization page.",
Terrible app. It says to verify my adult account. And it will not work. I can log into my Facebook on any device and any regular Facebook app but I cannot verify my Facebook with messenger kids. It would be nice if it actually let me log in so I could actually test the app with my child.,
It won't let me create an account for my son I've tried for 3weeks straight,
BRO I HAVE THIS BECAUSE MY FRIEND IS NOT GOOD WITH CHARGING HER PHONE WORKS IDK WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT,
Child can not log in,
I love it I can talk with my friend at school,
I can talk to my dad now because of this app,
Fun love kid safe texting,
So very nice this opportunity to my daughter ü§ó,
I as a kid love it,
It is sooooooo fun,
it is good and convient,
Please add screen share.,
Very useful app‚ù§,
Can't login! Tried several devices. Switched 2FA from a text code to Duo and all it does is push me back to enter my email and password. Shows as an authorized device on my account. SO FRUSTRATING.,
"It wont even let my child in. I put in my gmail, my facebook account, and my child's birthday, but when I click create account or whatever, it tells me that something wrong has happened. I have literally done everything I could, but nothing ever worked. Fix this please.",
"I have been trying to set up an account for my daughter before she goes back to her dad's, but it keeps saying error try again. She uses her aunties phone but has a tablet I will start sending her to video chat her without having to use their phones.",
Awful. You try to set it up and you get an error message. Been happening for days. Been in contact with customer support on MULTIPLE platforms and no response.,
"I love it, but on the pig game there are 5 problems. The wolf goes way WAY to fast. The bricks take to long to pick up and build, and the game keeps not showing when its supposed to but i still love it.",
This is an amazing app that allows kids too be able to talk with family and friends! It is also perfect for quarantine since we can't really see anyone.,
Little sister deleted the app and now we can't sign back in my mom tried signing back into my phone but we realized my phone wasn't the problem she tried it on my iPad and it worked it must be the app I would be really nice if someone could work on the app cuz it's so hard and now I have so much friends on there and I can't text them anymore and my phone is the best one to use but this app won't let me sign back in this app is a good app for your kids but it's just really hard to sign back in,
. Can't get it to approve some people that are important to my daughter. But otherwise it's great!,
"Whenever I'm on Wi-Fi it stays, sleep mode but whenever I call somebody and says it's not calling them but they say I'm calling them or I'm texting them it doesn't show up when they text me it shows up. Overall it's still pretty good.",
There are some advantages and about 1 disadvantage but above all that it is great and you can't delete your messages.,
Usually a great app for my kids to interact with their friends. It has however logged them both out and can no longer access it. Same story as those reviews before me.,
"My kids love this app, but its also very laggy and will sometimes glitch and then kick you out of calls. But other than that, It is a very good app for texting and all that sort of stuff.",
This app is resly nice to chat w/ family and friends! I'm giving it a 4 star bc when I send a question for friends you can't even read what the bottom choice says which is very annoying.,
It's a kid's version of messenger!,
Great app. But I wish there was a feature that we could put a block on their side that would allow us to make it so they stop blowing people up. üôÑ My daught I swear has called people 100 times during the day & that's each person.,
The app is great. Now I can video chat with my friend. But 1 thing is wrong. My friend can change his profile picture to something from his gallery on his apple iPad. But I can't on my Samsung phone. So I'm giving it 4 stars.,
"This is a great app. During the Christmas season, there was an additional option for children to talk to Santa. My kids loved it and it was an adorable option to go along with the other options this app offers.",
I love how my child can talk to friends on this app and how I can just sign her in thru my Facebook acount. It is a really great way for her to see people thru a screen and they can text too she feels like she's a grown adult. I think you should get this app.,
"App won't let me create an account for my daughter. I get a ""try again later"" error message every time. Ive been trying for weeks and have re installed this app several times.",
"Same exact issue as the previous 4 reviewers. Latest update broke app, can no longer get past log in screen, it's stuck in a continuous loop.",
"Its a good app.I am 12 years old and I use it.The only thing is that the filters are kinda boring and its frustrating to not be able to add your own contacts,but I know that's gor the very young kids.Overall a good app",
It won't let me sign in on my son's phone and keeps claiming it isn't connecting to wifi. I can watch shows in Disney + and Netflix. It would be nice to get this fixed. This app was part of the reason I got my son a phone.,
It works well. They sorted out a lot if the old bugs. But it still crashes every couple if days.,
"Seems like it could be a great app, but my child only has a laptop and desktop and can't access the app. Please help with making it compatible on all platforms. Thank you.",
"Good app, can reach long distance, will glitch sometimes (very rarely though). Could use more filters or some new updates. Overall a good app!!",
"Moving away, made easier. We recently moved to a new State and left a lot of friends and family. This app helps my kids stay in touch with their friends‚ô°",
"Haven't tried the app yet, but there is something wrong and is not letting me create my child's account. Whenever I click on, "" Create account."" It always says, "" there was a failure in creating your child's account. Please try again later."" So I was wondering what was that. Please let me know if I did something wrong! I tried uninstalling it, but it didn't work.",
Doesn't work for my son at all. We've tried it different times and even deleted it but no luck Update 11/27/20 - won't connect to internet. Stopped working even though it was working last night. I won't try this again.,
"My 9 yr old loves it, I love it. I love that I csn control who she speaks to and who she adds so I know it super safe. I was leery about my child having this, but definitely no regrets. She can stay in touch with me and her family and friends, it helps especially while we are quarantine-in!",
"My account was logged out fully and im trying to re login, Stuck on a infinite loop of facebook login isnt on my side tryed it on multiple devices please fix asap its been like this for a week i miss my bff. Also possibly add screen share please, it would be so helpful!",
please fix! its keeps crashing for my phone and i really like this app. the video is awesome and text is good too. just please fix the crash.,
"I was excited to get this app for my almost 7 year old daughter, just to find out the thing doesn't even work?? Whenever I put my email and pass in it would just say ""this user is not allowed to log into the app"" I am 20 and had my first daughter at 14 and I just wanted a texting app so that I could text her at school and with her school friends. I do have a Facebook account but for some reason it just wouldn't let me in",
"here's what I don't like. when I open the app and I have people to text, all is shows is add friend, make group, or take picture. please fix this because it gets on my nerves.",
Great for Kids! but I wish they were allowed to send pics and gifs and emojis. It blocks it. Also its hard for them to connect with friends unless I am friends with the parent...Makes it tough to figure out,
"Ok so my child had this app for a year now and she sends videos she made and now when she watches them from messenger kids the screen is tall and the character's look like sticks, she would be greatfull if you make it back to the old version it's on android tablet, overall it's a great app :-)",
"Eh it's fine I guess but whenever I try to get a new picture for my profile it kicks me out. Basically it's not bad but it contains wifi. I know that some apps contains wifi, but still they could of made it without wifi, like to call with no wifi, chat with no wifi. And I'm on android so these glitches are normal I Guess? And there's a certain amount of colors in the app, like green light green blue light blue cyan and so on. Here's my comment about MessengerKids, either your opinion,this mine.",
Its awesome I love that I can text or my friends without using my mom's phone but I wish there could be more stuff to do with the pets or having ringtones and textones but other then that its awesome especially during covid-19 I can text or call my best friend without going to the same school's,
"Awesome app....easy way for my kiddo to communicate and connect with me and her friends!! I have full confidence and control over it all, and nobody can added unless I approve it!! Very well done!",
app is worthless because of the audio echo during every call. only on parents end. I've uninstalled and tried multiple times from multiple devices - android and apple. what a shame. have to find another app that actually works.,
Its great... Although I dont like the set up on the photo thing where it changes your face. They took away me and my friends favorite one!!! The one where it makes my chin lift waits!! I would apreciate it if they put it back on... Permanently!!!!!!!!!!!!!! üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†,
downloaded for my son and it worked until about a week ago. now when it opens the app pops open for 2 seconds and crashes and instantly disappears. If this issue is addressed I will update my review. thanks,
"I really love this app, no worries about random people adding my child to chat and he can keep in touch with friends especially during the covid 19. I only wish it was available on pc as well.",
I personally think that it is a great app. I love being able to text my friends and family without a phone number. This app let's me text safely since I'm 9.,
Fantastic; I can't see anything wrong with it! I do wish the filters and games would get updated more often.,
I keep getting an internet connection error and i am clearly connected to the internet. There are no restrictions blocking access and i am able to login through a browser but this app is useless and trying to get help is even worse.,
"Huge privacy abuse riddled with dark design patterns: -When you create an account, you can see all of your Facebook friend's children's accounts. Which means your friends will see your child's account -By default all your children's contacts can be seen by all contacts. You can jump through the hoops and change it so only mutual contacts can see them, but you can't completely disable it -You cannot control the settings through the web version of Facebook. It forces you to install the app.",
We have had constant problems with this app since downloading. We tried to video call and the person on the other side cannot see us but on our side we cannot see them. Never had this problems with normal messenger,
"Meh. Not enough themes, won't let you send GIFs that aren't from messenger kids, and the GIFs you can use are freaking trash, camera doesn't work with taking a pic of a video game, sometimes it displays A square with OBJ in the middle of a text, games are REALLY laggy, pets don't stay, you're limited to 3 drawing guesses a day, and Video chat messes up a lot, especially with groups. PLEASE fix all of these issues and I'll rate ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ",
It's a great game no ads or in app purchases which is fantastic! I love how we can chat with close friends and family although we should have a little bit of a more interesting update soon but overall I love this app I would recommend it to people!,
My kid has had the best time on this app it is great I do recommend it for ur children because u can see who she/he is texting and also u can approve people that she or he can add it is a great again and I do recommend it but I have one complain all of her messages does not come through so when she gets a message she has to go on the app and look to see if she has any messages if it is just me that is ok but if its is alot of people I would like u to change it but it is a grand app I love it,
"I love this app so much and have had it for 5 years. However, later when I try to change my app color it says ""failed to upload favorite color"" I updated it and even updated my device no matter what I do I'm stuck on one color. Help fix this please",
"Good app, I wish we had more control over certain things. I can't figure out why my daughter can send me gifs, but I can't send her gifs. Anyway other than small settings issues, I like the app.",
"Okay, so I'm trying to set it up but I dont remember my password from when I was 12 amd the email that my mom used to set up is no longer functional. So I have no idea what my face book password and have no way to get it back and so I cant use the app. Facebook please fix this!!!!",
App is ok but sometimes I can't see one-on-one conversations with people (I only have access to group chats) and I can't see pictures my friends send me. Rest is ok.,
"There is a problem, when I try to change my Profile with the cameras, on the side, and when you enter the profile picture, when I go to the profile picture, it does not show gallery. When I go on the side camera, it does. How do I put that gallery picture on my profile.? My friends can change their profile because THEY have the gallery on the profile camera. I dont know how they do it, how is it fair..? There is a way to, but it looks sloppy, unlike my friends profiles.. Please fix this.",
Keeps telling me something went wrong while creating the account. I reinstalled it and tried numerous times. Love the idea but this app doesn't work.,
Love it does have some problems such as fails to send messages or slow to send or won't let you change your color or use filters other wise amazing!,
"The bip app help me and my family and friends easy to text,send music and videos to each other.My self I love this app because we use it free.Not using money just for free.",
Worked great for a couple of days but now the video constantly says off when she calls her friends and family. Have uninstalled and reinstalled and checked all permissions and still can't get it to work.,
This app is amazing! The only problem it has sometimes is when I'm videochatting someone and it has an echo on my words and it's really annoying. Please fix. I recommend this app,
"Kids cannot delete any messages in the app and that is good for the ability to review. However, parents cannot delete or erase messages or chats either which is VERY frustrating. One of my aunt thought it would be funny to send a curse word in a video to my child and I cannot remove it. Also, video chat should have the option to be disabled since parents cannot review what hapoened in these videos.",
It is a great app for my kids my oldest kid messages her friend and they do school together and it is a great way to talk to there grandparents and/or family. I would recommend this app for your kid(s).,
"I love interacting with my grandkids on this app, but can't figure out how to change my name to what they call me instead of my given name from Facebook. I tried making a separate profile, but now I don't get their messages anymore!",
"I love this app, the only thing that I think could improve is, on Samsung devices, there are less emoji and filters than on an Apple device, but in all, the app is great.",
"Microphone issues My microphone in the app just stop working instantly on my tablet. All permissions are on allow, not sure why. I have tested the mic and it registers what I say.",
"Good, but I would like to set times per day when they can be on or off. Sun-Thu and Fri-Sat are not good enough. I would also like to give my kids the ability to contact certain contacts outside the window they are restricted to.",
I love the app I was so excited that I could talk to my friend through quarantine but my friend and i sometimes had our screen freeze up and we could hear each other cause it was glitching but i think that was just our device we were using,
"You can talk with your friends if you're not in the same place, you can text them and send the messages once I sent a big, silly message. It was so silly, I love the app, you should download it. ü•∞",
You can do cool faces with filters and you you can talk to other friends while having so much fun like on face time but you can do FaceTime because like when that with the coronavirus you can't see your friends anymore that's if we gon zoom and stuff but I really really really really like messenger üòäüòÅüòâüòç,
The only glitch is that sometimes when im talking with my friends i cant hear them that well but thats only sometimes it is HIGHLY RECOMMEND other than the small glitch. Btw u can just hang up and call back a few times if that happens,
This game is VERY nice i love talking to my friends and video chat with them but the only thing i dont like is that you have to ask you're parents to add them. I think that y ou just need to know the code i know its for privacy reasons but can you add something so that you can ask that person in a text. Thank YOU.üòä,
The app only does video calls which is annoying because it can cause lag and the new update doesn't allow you to see your messages without leaving a call which is a Stupid design but besides that the app works.,
"Good, somewhat grainy, obscure when there is movement. Tough to get from black screen to visual. No easy black out of view option.",
"I really like the app because my daughter can now use the messenger even without a Facebook account which I love since I'm not yet comfortable to let her use Facebook. At the same time, I can control her contact lists and monitor her messenger activities. Kudos Facebook team for a job well doneüòäüëç",
"Good, but 1. laggy 2. Takes up too much of my space so can you make a lite version and 3. The filters are horrible and even worse face recognition.",
Love this app! Super fun and safe. I would like it if kids with android phones could have the new revamp. Other than that most of the time it works!,
The app is nice because I can talk to my friends but I'm constantly having problems with it. It doesn't need an update. I've also tried many possible solutions but nothing works so it's a constant waiting game,
"This is a great - kid friendly app! I love to text my children, and my children love to text their friends! It's a great app, but it sometimes lags.",
"Over all it's pretty fun, but the reason I rated it 3 stars is because: 1 let's say someone called me an hour ago but I didn't get a notification! 2: it turns this :) to this ‚ò∫Ô∏è and it's kinda annoying tbh. 3. Let's say my friend sends me a message at 3:00 but I get the message at 3:05-3:10. Overall it's ok. Oh and also before I forget I WANT MY PROFILE PICTURE RO BE SOMETHING FROM MAH GALLERY, BECAUSE EVERY TIME I WANNA CHANGE MAH PICTURE I NEED TO TAKE A PHOTO! bai",
I love this App! It's just like Zoom except its WAY more secure & it is linked to the parents Facebook account only so the parent can monitor their Kids activity but it doesn't give the kid any access to the parents Facebook account. it also doesn't allow the kid to click on any links or to download so they won't be accidentally downloading malware & such... Ditch zoom & get this one... You'll thank me later!,
Great little app to interact with my kids. Has games too. They have a few school friends they interact with and I appreciate that the experience is quite safe and they cannot add friends on their own nor share links. Overall a surprisingly good app.,
"Honestly very cute app especially how you don't want your baby to have an acc by themselves, you can monitor what they do, who they can call, who they can add. I hope they add a few more stuff the parent can do, still very nice.",
"very disappointed because in Europe I could not use it, and in Canada where we live I can no longer use it because I constantly receive the message ,,messaging and calling are not available in this chat right now"".I send a lot of feedback to facebook but useless!((",
Its grate at this kind off a time I get to talk to all my school friends and call each other down side is all the games like drawing a picture aren't the best the aim is of by a lot and it makes my art look bad(although It kinda is to begin with)it makes it look not like what I was going for other than that works like a charm,
"I am a kid that uses this app, I am 12 and communication is really easy on the app. I only give it 3 stars because it glitches alot when your video chatting, and doesn't send messages quickly.",
I love this app. It can do all features and cool things. Some times it does glitch but not a lot or often. Other wise it is perfect .,
It's annoying always messaging me to set it up for my son. I did and it's very limited he is a high intellectual 10 year old. Not enough for him to do on it. Best to just let them use my messanger instead.,
"app crashes every time we try to open it. Cant seem to find any support for it. works on other kids phones/tablets, does not seem to work with our chromebook",
"Won't even let me log in, can see through my messanger that his account is active. Very frustrating. Have tried several times to Uninstall and reinstall on several devices, no go.",
"I like the app, but its very slow. And i also really want you to add a screencast feature to it so i can show my friend Jude some of the stuff i made. And i also want a custom gif option for your own little animations.",
"As a parent it doesn't allow me to sign in as a parent, I have to add a separate child account in order to talk with another child, I guess it's good for child to child communication still doesn't work to send messages or chat, from my regular Facebook messenger to kids messenger... And then every time I open it up it says session expired login again! So ya know untill that gets fixed I'm giving it 1 star!",
my kids and I love this app. please make a desktop version asap. we switched from tablets to computers. now the kids can't use this app anymore. please advertise for that feature when it happens. thanks.,
Made for kids controlled by parents it's super fun there's all kinds of games on there that you can play drawings you could talk to your friend family and even parent it is fun for you because you get to control what your kid does on there and it's pretty fun try it out,
i love this app . the resion why i dident give it 5 stars is becouse when you try to make a video it gliches so many times . But if they could fix the problum the app would be perfect,
It some time is a little laggy overall its good but you can't share links and I understand that but it's hard to send videos to other people unless you have another device to record it on that why I give it a four star,
"Simply does not work. Gets stuck in an endless loop asking for password and some failure message. Which is a blessing, less Facebook is always good.",
"Real nice app, you can call without problem, text, the only problem is the games during calls don't work very well, but there not really nessacary, so yeah. Real nice!",
"This app inspired me in all sorts of ways my step brother absolutely Loves this app. Some things that i think that need to improve are, that we think taht you should be able to add more friends. Thatk you sp much for the creaters of this game and we hope you all enjoy this app as much as we do!",
"I love this app, l can chat, face-time, send pictures and play games with my friends. I can also make group chats witch I think is really nice. l can even draw! Personally I love this app!",
This app is so amazing because I get to talk to my family and friends when I get to and I also get to send them cool and funny pictures and it's kind of like face time except it's for kids this is amazing to have left your kids download Messenger kids so they can talk to their family and have fun instead of using their parents his phone,
"This app is really good...awsome and really fun to use..but there are some things that you could actually improve on..like you could add something by which we could use our gallery for profile and also the parents could actually see all the messages without downloading the app...Besides these,this app is perfect for children..‚ò∫",
"Great app, but if I could see the messages sent between the different contacts and not only the images I'd feel better. (Parent of 8yr old boy)",
"I love the app and talking to all my friend, one problom I cant see or text my mother on kids messenger! It started about a month back and we've tried everything! If there is a way to fix this please tell me. Thank you!",
Hi I love this app I'm using it everyday it's super safe and fun to talk with friends without worrying The only thing that I wish they would have is a story like in Facebook and Messenger because sometime I just wanted to make a story instead of just sending it in the conversation I just think it's weird so please considered this message thank you,
I had to set it up twice instead of once and it was a lengthy process. Just because I had to install it on both her and my phone. it should have only had one parent have to run through the process and not send duplicate request to all of our contacts.,
Cannot get the app to work. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling it. It worked fine until yesterday and now says I (parent) have to confirm my Facebook with password but says my password is invalid. So I reset it. Still will not allow me to log in.,
i love this app for my kids. only 2 things i wish i could check my kids messages from my phone instead of having to take their phone away to check the messages. and be able to erase old messages once i have read them.,
Won't even let me set up my kids account. I've tried multiple times. Uninstall and reinstall for the last two days. Just doesn't work. Just keeps saying failure to create account üôÑ zero stars,
Its the best app ever during covid and also its good to have after school when your at home so you can call your friends. its been a big help to actually see my friends during covid and see how there doing. also if i sound like a bot im sorry but i swear im not.,
This has been great for my kids over the school closure. They enjoy the games and talking to their friends. Finding my code was a bit difficult. But a quick google helped a ton!,
"I like messenger kids! It is pretty good but, i would like to be able to remove messages even if i'm a kid. And also i would like to unfriend or remove someone without blocking them. I hope Facebook reads this. Overall, i like it!",
App is great for kids sign her up she was so happy she picked her colour and she picked pink she was so happy then I added her friends and family on it. After that she's been using it it's been 2 years and she's 8 years old and she still loves that she talked to all her friends and called them every single time this app is awesome if you have a kid and you want to install this I agree with you,
When we facetime each other one of our panels turned black. We tried to call each other again and one of us is still black. Throughout messenger kids it is better thannI expected. I hope the screens/panel gets fixed soon. Or is it only on our side? But our connection is fine üòÄ,
Me and my bestie were spaming with gifs. and the next day it wouldnt let me text her anymore it kept saying can't send message. I hope they will get that fixed but other then that the app is very good!,
I love everything about this app! Except a few things. 1- Please add more colours to the colour wheel for choosing your app colour. 2- Like with the app messenger on Apple products can we like rename the contacts just please that's what I really want the app to add!,
I rate it a 4 because it's really neat and arranged and fun for kids because there is games and filters but I would have given this a higher rating if the app wouldn't glitch on me it doesn't let me text anyone rn it keeps freezing up and I've tried for 10 min straight can you please help me with this?,
"It's ok ig. My mom made me download this even tho I've been using normal messanger with no problem, but with the profile picture, you can't select one from your gallery which is kinda stupid. But it's ok other than that.",
"It worked really good until the most recent update when it wouldn't let me in AT ALL. I went in, and then two seconds later i was in my home screen. Now i cant talk to my friends and family until I see them again. I hope you fix this",
its kid friendly and its a good way for the parents to make sure their kids arent saying anything bad,
"I like this app but i would like you to add a list of things to do on a call for example, draw,play a game,talk. And change the name to kids messenger. And also make it so kids can add to the bored of things to do on call",
i get to video call my online best friend but it automatically ends calls A LOT and i can text without Wi-Fi but cant get texts back and it somtimes says unable to send when you have Wi-Fi and she once said she would send videos but she could only send one :/ only good call we've had was 6 hrs,
"The only problem i have is that the only way i can add people to our group chat is if they're friends with that one person and i would like you to have so we can add anyone to our group chat and i will give it 5 stars, also sometimes i dont get the notifications at all so can you please fix it so i always get notified if someone messages",
"Perfect! You can call and play games with your friends,and also do it while in call! my kid said-so I assume it's really good!",
Great that its easy to monitor which friends/family kids are talking to & teaching them responsible but would like to be easier for(especially each parent)people not wanting to create a 'kids' account to message their kid but otherwise pretty good and almost simple,
"Unable to authorize after installing. Prompted to ""Confirm Guardian"" and after entering email and password I am taken back to the ""Find you account"" screen. This has been reported here and on many other websites since Sept 21 2022 and it seems there is no resolution. That's 6 days so far.",
"Stuck in account verification loop, just like others. I've tried on multiple devices, multiple days in a row. After entering my password, a pop up with ""Logging Out"" comes up and sends me back to login.",
Clunky integration with parental messenger...my kid adds his friend from school. I get the notification to allow him to add a friend. Clickon the notification and it takes me to the home screen with no way to approve his friend request.,
I like the app but I don't like how you can only change your picture through your gallery on a apple iPhone or table because I want to change mine to something in my gallery but I can't because I don't have a apple device it's kinda annoying and I would love if you fixed that also I don't like how when you block people they still show up on there,
I like the fact that I can keep it contact with my kids and send photos but why can't they send videos to me?? It's kind of irritating I recorded something on her phone and tried to send it to me but it never went through.,
Can't receive notifications for new messages even when notifications are switched on Just updating on August 23rd 2020 When they give an update for this app I all of a sudden lose the ability to receive notifications for messages received.,
"bad filters- they are very ugly other than that, nice app for face timing, recording voices, and texting- you can only ft and not vc though, which I think they should add 6/10- could be better....",
I really do like this app for my child. It helps her be more active in communicating with all her friends a nd classmates during this pandemic. She never was once sad or lonely because she can always send emojis or drop some voice msgs to her teacher and friends.,
"This kids app sucks so far, I can't access anything on it, I'm not creating two accounts for my daughter, keeps kicking me off before I can even use it, it keeps going into sleep mode, fix this or I'm uninstalling and never using it again, I would give you zero stars, but it won't let that happen",
"I think the app is great, my 9 year old can stay I contact with long distance family. highly recomend. I am the only one who can add his friends as well as approve them.",
My kid loves this app. With school being cancelled this works! I will like a time block option though. I don't need our devices going off at 3 am from a child that isn't supervised by parents. A start time option and a stop time option would make so many parents happy.,
My son's both love this app. I love that I can select who they get to speak to for their safety. The games on there are cute and entertaining. I don't need to worry with them using this app. Definitely recommend for other parents.,
Worked when first installed on Samsung Chromebook.  Worked for the first two days then crashed.  Had to uninstall and reinstall but app still will not launch.  Very frustrating.,
"No matter what buttons I pushed or how much I looked, couldn't get the app to actually put a message through to anyone. Deleted it and going with a more dependable app.",
Can't login to the app to confirm parent with my login info... try to use the code they send and it just keeps going back to the beginning to login again. I have tried for hours. Also tried using the other parents profile and phone. NOTHING WORKS!,
I use messenger kids and love it but there is a few things that I think you should change firstly when you go to call someone it should bring up a box that says are you're shore you would like to call (persons name) becouse I have axadently called people to many times just scrolling through my contacts also I dont always get notafacations when I get a text evan with notafacations on other then those 2 things I love this app and recommend it to others,
Love being able to talk to my kiddos on here and see their funny pictures they take with the filters. Love that I an control who they speak to. Still learning the app but overall very pleased with it.,
Not able to log in! Have tried all the different options on the page. Have uninstalled and reinstalled. Very disappointing and frustrating!,
I downloaded this to keep in contact with my child while at work or whenever and it won't let me log in and it never sends the email or text for a temp password and I know my info was correct t to link it to my fb cause I use the same email and password for my fb on my phone or lap top and I log in fine but when it comes to using this it doesn't work it's very irritating this would have been perfect for us,
Tried adding an account for each child while we're stuck in quarantine. It wont let me log in for the second child; keep getting a preventing spam error that tells me to try again later. Wish both kids could use,
This app continues to distribute unwanted ads to my friends contacts. I am unable to find tools to change settings or delete the app. Make it STOP!,
"It's a really good app for kids but the other day it deleted some of my messages with someone for no reason? I can't change the theme but my friends can & my text colour is automatically dark blue and I can't change it. When I'm on a call and put on a face affect, it might say 'tap' when I tap it nothing happened but it does for my friends, whenever I try play a game it doesn't let me move either but it does on the camera?",
It's a really great app the only hang up is I have an iPhone my friend has an Android and I have a game on my phone on kids messenger and she doesn't have it but other than that it's pretty great also it doesn't have very good Wi-Fi and I love to run so when I go on runs I can't text my mom and tell her that I'm okay . Other than that pretty good I just wish I had better wi-fi and that my friends have the same games that I do on messenger kids,
Great app its great for kids to text and call friends and faimly all thought my problem is diffrent devices if your on amazon you wont have all the photo things or all the games i dont know about other devices but please make it all the same it just dose not seem fun when friends have other stuff than yourself,
This app is great! There is just one ttttiiiiiinnnnnnyyyyyy feature you should add. That feature is selecting a profile picture from your gallery.,
it is an amazing app if your kid want to call there friends and i like how you aka the parent gets to decide if you want that kid messenging your kid.it can also help kids get to there goals like if they want it they can work for something.over all i think its an amazing app!!!!,
This app has amazing results kids can contact their friends and you! You need full internet but you can use stickers on the call and if u just want to text a photo!! Parents need to accept adding new friends but besides that its great!!,
"Very good, the only problem is that the audio on calls break sometimes, which is very bad when my friend and I want to play games on call.",
"Having real problems with this app still it just logged itself out on my phone have not been able to get back in since, have unistalled changed password restarted phone and still no change, would like to know why this has happened.",
Please add a call opition it's so annoying that you can only do face time calls. my brother uses it and its always on face time just add an audio call feature.,
"Kids ise this app, I've been online and I have been getting extemly inapropriate adds about Scatter Slots. Could you do something about this because it's very disturbing and I don't enjoy the fact that we need to look at a partially naked woman. Please fix this if you can",
Awesome app! I can see how much time my daughter's been spending on it and who she has been messaging. If your child has sent something inappropriate the app will notify you. Definitely recommend.,
Won't even let you login in anymore; just brings you right back to the parent login screen. Have tried everything under the sun. My son is so upset he can't talk to his friends. This app sucks! If I could give it no stars I would.,
Messager kids needs some updates wich are bug fixes when I text someone for a while it will say message not sent. there are pretty cool features like filters you can even use it when you call someone you can use games when you call people!,
It is great except you can't do voice calls! And when it turns off your parent can't put their fb password in for more time temporarily! Thank you so much for this app!,
Garbage app. Doesn't work. Didn't receive messages it sent even after the app was downloaded and just continued to send prompts to download the app. I would not recommend.,
"I love it's ways you can make fun photos and, mostly learn stuff my child has been learning so much from it. Thank you. Buy this app for free it's worth your time and your whole life. For your child safety care.",
"Everything is good but it is a little hard to figure out how to add a friend to your kids account. Other than that situation it is an amazing, safe, and fun messaging app! 4/5 stars",
"My only complaint is that my daughter can't have sound in voice clips or in calls or even in videos. It doesn't work! Otherwise, she loves it!",
This this is so amazing I can talk to my grandma who's in Texas so I don't go see as much but I can call her so it is a very good app if I was lots of things to do when you're bored you can call people you can play games with each other you can send funny stuff to each other like stickers or pictures or emojis is just a great game but there is o e thing i wish i could share my screen ü•∫ but other than that good job guy's üëèüëèüéäüéâ‚ù§,
I really like this app. I can talk with my friends as long as i have their code. Only problem is that some of the extra games wont load but otherwise AMAZING!,
"It's a very safe app to my 11 year old and she is on it a lot to chat with her friends, she plays roblox and other games on her iPad all the time and it is not laggy att all. But when she doesn't play video games she loves to mess with the filters.",
It's great for communication only one problem with it sometimes it's laggy andit all hang up on you when you're calling someone besides that it's an amazing app and I love it it's great!!!!,
I was trying to make an account so me and my friends could talk to each other but it would say account creation failure over and over again. I even uninstalled it then reinstalled it.,
"It's so frustrating! I couldn't even get pass the the guardian/parent screen! I tried making an account for myself but whenever I tap ""Make Account"", it just says ""Oops something went wrong!"" I tapped it again and again! üò°",
"I cant log in. No matter what I try it tells me ""No account"" I've had my Facebook account for years and it works just fine. So I dont know why I can't log into this app but its irritating and renders the app useless.",
the app is a good app I just would like more control setting. For instance being able to hide your online status. Or even 've able to sign out.,
Says error and wont let me make a account. Absolute trash.,
Best thing ever we and my friend can chat and we don't do anything bad! It's good that parents can watch us! From Elle (Sorry it's short),
I think that the app is cool. I get that theres a lot of apps that you use to text to friends but for kids. If you are a parent you can see what they say and the person their talking to or even who they are talking to.,
this app is defiantly helpful for Covid -19 because your kids can see there friends without going there but there is one problem it is a screen time activity and i wish you could limit it to a good time.,
I love everything about this app the only thing I don't like is for when you make your picture I feel like you should be able to go into your gallery and then choose it or then a possibility possibility to take a picture or go to your gallery and pick a picture from there that's the only thing I would like there to change everything else perfect,
Great experience over all. the only thing bad about it is that it has a bed time and if you don't use it for a while you have to sign back in. Parents can control who you can text as well. 4/5 experience,
"I love being able to text and call my daughter, but I seem to always miss her calls and texts because it won't notify me. I even have all my notifications turned on.",
"I am unable to create an account for my daughter, I get the same account creation error message saying that something went wrong. I have tried submitting a bug report through Facebook but have gotten no response.",
Takes up lots of space. It used to just be on the loading screen and hardly would it work. Its working now but still takes lots of space. In my opinion,
Everything else is good but when I call someone the call disconnects but my wifi is good. ALSO THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. AND IT IS SO DISAPPOINTING! PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM.,
Terrible app. Totally unreliable. 3/4 of the time I don't even get notified that my grandchildren have sent messages. Have uninstalled and reinstalled... Same thing. Wish I could give it zero stars.,
This app is great I can call and text who ever I want and there are very fun games you can play on facetime and I enjoy playing them with my cousin and sister! But maybe can you have a limit of how many pics you can send in a day because my cousin blows my phone up with photos..,
I love this I get to connect with friends that don't have phones to text so I can still text them also the quality is very good but at first it did not let me type so I had to re download it and it still did not work but it just took some time and now it works just fine,
"I can text, but almost Every time I try to open the keyboard I can type 1 letter then it closes again and it's really annoying. And the voice type dosnt work anymore. :(",
"I think this is great and this is a very safe app. I can talk to my friends and family. It even has activities on them, you can play a drawing game, ask fun questions, and take a cool photos! It is appropriate for everybody! üòÅ",
"No stars. It just quit on my grandson. Just keeps saying something went wrong, try again later. Well we've been trying for 3days and it won't let us open anything. More Facebook related poop !!! Guess we'll look for another way for our kids to stay in touch. So Facebook and all its apps can kiss our as$.",
"I like this app. I chat a lot with my mom, cousins and friends. It is a lot like the real Messenger, but for kids. If there are any parents out there that want there children to stay in touch with friends and family, I totaly recomend this app.",
"Let my daughter have the FB experience, keep in touch with her family, and message me every 5 seconds to tell me her aunt hasn't replied yet.... Hahaha that's real but it really enables family communication to a whole new level. This idea was a pretty good one. Thanks",
"Probably fun for the kids, but no fun for the adults. My neice and nephew message me all the time with fun GIFs and filters, but I can't reciprocate anything but voice chats since they can't read. I understand why they wouldn't want adults being able to send unfiltered gifs and stickers to the kids, but I just want my own Messenger Kids app without setting up for a child, we're already connected! Or fix compatibility with regular messenger",
It's an amazing app and I left a message my friends family when Coronas going around it's better than when it's not Corona cuz he wouldn't need to talk on it because well you can talk to them in real life not not when Chrome is going around so it's really fun and really nice to do activities and text her friends and family fairy I love it so much thank you for making this app real bye,
I got this app because at a sleep over saw she had it so my parents let me get it to and I love it I can call friends family as long as they have it to i can also make groups as long as all the people you want to a add have each other and there are all different kinds of things when you take pictures it does not have ads or any thing like that because it is a texting app for kids parents you should introduce it to your kids and let them get it kids you should ask your parents for it.üê∂üêïüê©ü¶Ñüåàüíú,
Its ok it works! I wish they would let you do voice call and video call because its annoying only having video call! You guys should update the app and make it different and add different things to the app.,
"Reasonable app. However, it would be better if I could connect him via a phone number to somebody. Myself and my ex husband are not friends on Facebook so my son can't communicate with him on this app :(",
"I really enjoy this app. Because my grand daughters and i live a pretty good disance apart. So a lot of our communication is on fb. So my daughter sent me this app. So u could have more one on one time with each of my grand daughters. And its wonderful. Them girls are some more special to me, my heart and life. One proud and loved Granpa.",
"This is a very good texting app! I like how its completely controlled by your parents,It makes me feel safer then on Snapchat. But I do wish you could save videos and I wish there was more colors/you could make your own",
"Awful...Don't even bother....it doesn't recognize my account, stating ""no account found"" and I cannot use it at all...not able to download it on my daughter's phone, either... because it says it doesn't recognize my email address. What a waste of time! (And a disappointment for my daughter. Trying on Android device, BTW. Uninstalling.",
"Hi! My kids love it! They don't have phone's and they don't use FaceTime and messenger kids allows them to chat, FaceTime, send stickers and more to there family and friends. I highly recommend.",
"very poorly designed. as an adult I want to have my childs account not just on his device, but mine as well. it does not cross platform well and is frustrating when adding friends and family the way it is done. not worth the hassle. immediately deleted.",
I love this app it's very easy too add peaple but I have found this glitched in the filters the ufo and the hot chocolate one. The filters is ubove me and you can see inside of it.,
"Glitchy, crashes, not user friendly. When I (parent) request a 1 time code, it asks for a 2nd code but never sends it. Really more hassle than it's with in my opinion.",
It's SO GOOD! Me and all my friends have been using it for 5 or 4 years now and my mom adds my family on there by facebook and my aunt and all my friends are on there it's a good safe and alsome app and sense I have my own phone and I'm to young to have actual messenger this is the best app one of my mom's friends got me into this it's so good I don't even know what to do or say. I'm glad. however made this I hope you should be proud. And I see people with 1 star and I want to say you mean. 499,
"Its a fine messaging app but at long, random intervals my masseges nor the other persons messages will send leaving both of us frustrated and confused. Please, please fix this...",
Kia ora This app is amazing!!!! I get to chat with my friends in lockdown and FaceTime them on my tablet.i do recommend this app.‚ò∫Ô∏è You can also do games by you'r self or with someone. You can put filters on when you take a photo and decorat it.so I do recommend this app.,
"I could talk to my friend who I hadn't talked to for like to 5 years! I highly recommend this app. The only problem is some of my messages don't reach to the person. But still, luv this app :). Hope u recommend it too!",
I've had this app before and I like it really well but the reason I'm giving it four stars is because I'm trying to make an account and every single time I finish everything and try to press create account it says somthing went wrong while you were creating your account,
I love the app but I have one problem every time I text and someone texts back I don't get the notification. I have to constantly look in the app after text.,
"Love the app, but I got one problem. I started a video chat with my sister and my cousin so we could play roblox together, when I got into roblox I couldn't hear anything that they were saying even though the video chat was still running. My sister didn't had that problem. Please fix my problem, I promise to change my reiview after you do.",
"I honestly really like this app, but I would really like that in the Androids you could put photos from your gallery, because I realized that only in iOS you can put photos from the gallery, and I wish that Android could also put photos from your gallery. I hope you read this, and fix it",
Me and my daughter love Messenger kids. It is a way for her and her friends to connect and chat safely. My daughter said it would be nice to have kids avatars like in normal facebook and more filters. Other than that it's great! üíú,
I love talking to my friends on here like I can make them laugh send them videos messages I mean I can do that all the all through the phone but still it's a very cool and it's a very cool app for kids so if you're a kid you should download it then you can talk to your friends and your girlfriends and everything it's just very cool oh and also if you haven't seen somebody for a long time you can like get them on messenger kids and then you can talk to them like everyday,
Sometimes people don't answer back but it's okay I guess you know why because let's face it the camera works just fine the only thing that I had problems with was connecting when I was in a different house and turning on data but oven that it works that's why I gave it a 4-star rating ‚úå,
"This app is very good, I recommend it but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because you cannot change your profile picture to a photo you have in your gallery, I've tried it but it doesn't really work.. please fix that if you can, but overall a good app",
i love the app although there is a problem im trying to talk to my friends on chrome book but they can hear me and i constently have to update the app so they can hear me also it takes a really long time to install so i would recomend downloading it on a mobile device thats why i gave it three stars but totally recomend it try to get this fixed but thanks!,
I wish there was a way to mute the app. Its annoying when the app buzzes multiple times and you have to press 'can't talk now' multiple times.,
This app is safe and really good for kids but I don't know if it's my phone or the messenger app because once and a great while it gets really skippy and so you have to just turn your phone off and and take away all your notifications but other than that its such a good app so that's why I'm gonna give it 4 starsüòÅ,
Its safe i can see everything he is doing just in case he's being inappropriate. And I've caught him a few times being annoying and or staying up all night to talk to friends.,
It makes it really easy to contact your friends and family but its a little annoying that you cant add people to a group if their not friends :).,
it is a very goood app and does a lot but also would be nice if it would but more stuff in like when you facetime you can put stuff on your face it would be nice if they had more off that but it is the best thing to get i think it is you should get the app for your kids because mine love it and it is safe and you can make pictures of stuff and send it to people and make group chats with people.,
This app is amazing i love chatting with my friends my grangparents my dad my uncles and friend. Everyone should install this app its very fun Especially group chats it doesnt matter the age you are because im an older kid and i still love this app the only problem is that it glitchs a lot but thats the only thing thats wrong so i love this app everyone go and hit that install button!! :-) üëªüòª,
"This app was amazing until just yesterday, when it isn't letting me type anymore??? It brings the keyboard up and let's me call and send emojis, but the text doesn't work-? Please fix this and üåü will be yours.",
"I am very upset and stressed with this application, it cannot be possible that he will not let me do a kids messenger for my child, I put all the information to do it, and he says that it cannot be, that something went wrong, they need to fix this quickly! I have three days trying and this does not make sense at all because other people can do it and I am the only one that Facebook does not let, do something about it ASAP",
My kids love this! This messenger kids app is amazing!!! It's super fun! You complete missions and play games. You get to text your friends and family! Super super fun! It is completely safe for kids. I love Messenger Kids!!!!! üòçü§©üëç,
My daughter was so happy when I downloaded this app for her... She loves it she can get on messager and talk to her uncle and grandparents that live out of state... This is a great app. I got non stop messages when ever my daughter gets messages... Get app that's all I can say,
Its amazing how you can call your friends with out having to pay! Also able to text other poeple with your friends! Also kinda like snap chat but no captions anyway any kid i know would absolutely love this so try it your self! ENJOY!!:-),
"Honstley, I dislike it. Its good becuase I can chat with my friends but if I send them too much messages then it says unable to send. Its been happening more often now and Im not even spaming! All I can do is video call them and sometimes were in public!",
Just installed this and set it up for my kids and added a few of her friends. Now I can't respond at all to my kids or my Facebook friends that I added to her contacts. I tried messaging Messenger Kids and it said I'm not allowed to start new conversations for 24 hours. GET THIS FIXED NOW!,
"There is a glitch everytime I try to call my friend, one of us answers, and it glitches out, and hangs up. I REALLY miss my friend, and would loe if you could fix it.",
It was so cool so cool filters some was games a great way to chat with your friends and family some times it took 1 minute to get out of the filters but the rest is perfectly fine I think you should download this app üëçüëç,
"I like the concept, although trying to approve somebody for my daughters use via my phone, is something my friends and I have not figured out yet. We have to go on the desktop to figure out how to approve requests.",
"I like it, I feel that they watch what u send cuz it wouldn't let me send videos of baby bunnies. U can't send the poop emoji and it needs more gifs(and people who have messenger can't send gifs to people who have messenger kids ) stickers and emojis . And better games and filters. But other than that it s a good app",
It keeps asking for a code that it supposedly sent me but I have never gotten one. Why should I need a code after I sign in with my password and why can't I use the code generator in Facebook? This is quickly becoming very frustrating. Figured it out since then...,
"My daughter loves being able to video chat with friends and family. The only complaint is there should be more filter options for kids like there is for regular messenger, bc when she does video chat the adult family members she talks to has filter options she doesn't have.",
"This has been the perfect app to use as my ""online"" babysitting time with my granddaughter. Especially during this Pandemic. It always updates with new games to play or new video graphics. We love using this app to video chat. Love, love, love it‚ù£",
"Used to work but now constantly says something went wrong when creating an account, uninstalling and reinstalling does nothing. Ridiculous waste of time.",
It's a fun app for kids. They can talk to friends and family. You can video chat or text. It has fun drawing games and a pet you grow. I segest it for everyone.,
"Like it but my daughter can't play the games that come with it. When she tries to tap the screen where you're supposed to, it doesn't work. You have to tap up & to the right of where you want. If what you need is on the right of screen, you can't play the game. This is the only app that does this on her tablet.",
This app has been a life saver for my elementary school aged kids during covid. They can connect with friends and family and it has ever changing content and games that they love all while learning how to communicate on social media. Possibly Facebook's best product?,
"It's overall great, but I don't get notifications when one of my friends text me. Is there a way to fix this? I have notifications on in the app and in settings. I have tried everything because I know how these things work but it might be something wrong with the app. I am 14.",
"I love it for my kids so they can see there friends on the weekends. They also love it I love it to, I like it just because my kids and there friends stay connected. Every day they call the people who they have on messenger and there family... Of course but they lOVE it!",
"The only problems is that I can't make a group with my friends that don't know each other because i want them to meet,I can't play games with certain people, sometimes the app doesn't tell me if someone is texting,and it doesn't send my texts I'm very mad so PLEASE FIX THIS APP",
"This is very safe for kids,my kids especially love it im so happy it's a little like Facebook my kids like it they text and send funny pics you can play games as well! I don't have to deal with, my kids FINNALY A BREAK FROM THE NATTERING",
It's such a good app for kids to communicate whith there family and friends and I'm a 13 myself and I love it there's som activites u can do on here is just so amazing and I really like using it because there the virus going around and u cant go out and see friends and stuff so ya I really love this app and as far as I know it's a great amazing app and I really highly recommend this appüò∑ü§óüòã,
"App won't send me a code to even use it. I get a message that asks me if I approve the app. I click ""yes"" but the app wants a code. Poor execution that it can't get around its own security.",
"Needs more options for kids, it seems too childish for my neice and nephews for what is allowed. It's nice to see what they're doing or know, but, 11 and 12 yr old kids know much more than what is allowed. Needs more age appropriate options. To minor for options listeded",
"idk it was great then (btw today's the 31) today it started not letting me in the app ,I restarted my tablet nd unstalled it and reinstalled it but nothing worked,it seems like other people are having the same issue and the ratings of this app may go down so please get the bug fixed,thank you.",
"I have a 4 year old neice and she loves calling us on the app. She will play with the filters and other additional features. She lives in south carolina and we live in missourri, so im really happy we can talk to her.",
"its realy fun, and you get to talk and play games, also u can put on a filter or the other things, i forgot what there called, but.......sometimes when i put on a filter or the other things, it takes like 20 secends to see it on my screen (Jaina)",
"This app is safe and wonderful for kids! I love that I have control over who my children can talk to, but they get the freedom to call and text their family and friends any time they want, with lots of fun little extras.",
"This app is great for kids, as the parent account is linked to theirs you can see everything they do and say and they can't add anyone unless you approve it. Great for pre-teens!",
He loves being able to talk to family and friends. I love being able to keep him safe and reread messages if needed. Nothing can be deleted and no one can just add him it's great been waiting for this for a while!!!,
"App is trash, would give it no stars of I could. I must approve each person though a connected device (which I am ok with) but It also appears you have to know or be friends with your child's friends as well, or their parents, in order for it to work.. I don't know my daughters classmates, nor their parents, and honestly I do not want to be forced into having to know them just so my child can talk to her classmates. Utter trash.",
"Good and safe although my one problem is that my friend calls me consistantly and its realy anoying so like some others said,plz make a button to block all calls.thx.also sometimes it takes forever to send,so plz fix the bugs,thx again",
"Its good but recently I can't work the keyboard. I don't think this is a problem on my device, seeing as my family has the same problems but we all have different devices. Please fix and thanks in advance",
Great for my kids. I feel safe and my kids love it. Now they have their own phones they could text on. My children have fake phones they cant call or text on it and now they dont have to steel my phone and text their friends!,
Love the kid freindly interface and its amazing i just wish there was more like facebook messanger. Please take this in and think about it but other than that its amazing! Edit:OKAY FIRST OF ALL MY SISTER CANY USE THE FILTERS SECOND OF ALL SHE CANT USE THE GAMES OR ELSE IT WILL EXIT AND OR REFRESH AND STILL WONT WORK FIX THIS IMMEDIETLY PLEASE! im still leaving the five star review,
"I really like this App but for some reason there is no notification sounds. All settings for Notifications are on but no sound, so my daughter isn't hearing when someone sends her a message..... What should I do????",
I like it but there are a few reasons why I give it 4 stars. It won't let me insert any gifs and it sometimes doesn't notity me if I get a message. Also can you put a option to pick a ringtone? Thanks!,
This app is amazing for kids to keep in contact with family and friends. I love it because my daughter can video chat with me anytime. Also Facebook monitor conversations and let's me know if anything offensive is being said and messages. Thank for creating this,
"This is the perfect app for my 7 year old to speak with her friends and family that I approve. I can call her and live chat with her when she is over someone else's, and she can call me anytime she wants. I didn't have issues setting her up. It was pretty easy",
"Difficult and annoying on set up. My son has random accts and some made by members of family that made it from the invite it sent out. So he has family added, and their own accts for him they made. But no matter what, all messages and videos come to mine only. Very confusing. He's 7 and just enjoys talking to ppl so I'll leave it on his kindle but my phone blows up all day with his notifications.",
"I love this it is a great way to contact my grandparents talk to my BFF that I can't much I get to talk to family, friends and it's just so easy the only flaw is that I cannot use it offline that's my only complain but other than that I love it they have cute filters the way you can still play games and put on filters during video chats video chat is a good addition to the messenger I've had all kinds of different like Messengers for kids but this is the best one I have had this app for 2 years",
"This app is great!! And get this! When u want to add a kid to ur chat list thing, the message goes to there parents first for their permission!! Also, u can add as many friends as u want! Kids can text people, or FaceTime them whenever they want!",
This app is vary nice i have no problems with it its great for me and my friends to be safe and its cool you can play games and there are cute funny and fun stikers and filters all i had to do was to tell my friends my code its easy and fun and you can send would you rather and lots more even take care of a little pet this is a vary vary nice game an if your reading this you should download this app,
I loved this app. My friend which is an iPhone user got the new update. I am an android user and updated the game. Nothing changed. I had the same layout and same things as before. Is the update only for Apple users? If so I would like it to be for devices.,
I have nothing other than good things to say about this. As a 12 year old this is really nice to be able to text and call my friends. The only thing is I wish we were aloud to change contact names and have more colors to decorate the app,
I love that my son can easily talk to his relatives and friends and that I know exactly who he is talking to. Being able to control who can talk to him on the app is really great. He loves it and gets to socialize and make memories with loved ones during this difficult time.,
"Love the app for my kids to message me. Dont like that my kids tablets are child proof and locked except this app gives your kids access to internet explorer. Something i'm not comfortable letting my kids use just yet, and now this app lets them open it. Now I can't use the app cause of my region. It was fine 6 months ago.",
When I downloaded this to talk to my sister I couldn't because everytime my parents accepted her request the conversation wouldnt come up and we could never get it to work. I dont know why its acting up like this because this is my first time using the app and I cant do anything. I also wish this app was giving the children more freedom because we can barely do anything on this app and I feel like that is completely unfair. Until this is fixed I totally do not recommend.,
"This app is great. I can talk wih my friend and others. I love it. One thing, I can't figure out why my camera keeps going black! I have to hang up the phone. And then call my friend back.",
"Allow parents or the kid to change their dp/picture using the device photos. I'm only seeing the camera, no way for the current photos on phone. And allow the kid to add nicknames for each contact for them to easily know or manage who they're messaging with.",
"I love this app! It is on meh phone and i can text anyone with no lags, glitches, or anything weird! I can play games when im bored! I can now text my own twin sister, Alia! I can like almost do anything! Like i can rlue the world or something üòãapp ever! Would recommend!- Arianaüòçüòçüòç",
there is not a settings button for the adult side to change anything. you can remove someone you have added when they don't accept the invitation. its frustrating and lame imo.. besides that i see my daughter likes the app.,
Can't get rid of messages that failed to send. They always appear as newest and I have to scroll up to see messages sent to me.,
"Great thing for kids. Wish we could share GIFs and links to websites that I as a parent want to share with my child, etc. Since all the contacts that my child has are approved through me I think it would be safe to be able to share more with my kid, etc.",
this app has been the absolute best until today. it kicked me off several times and said my account didnt exist. now ive gotten back in and it will not let me send videos for some reason. going to try reinstalling again.,
U need to fix a couple thing it dose not pop up nor make a noise when some one is call ing my and It will glitch a lot. Other than that it's a great app!,
"This is a great app! But with some of my friend's messenger kids, they can afd music to videos they make, but I can't do that, and I don't know why. Anyway, fun app! I love it!",
"Great app. Wish I could remove the scary zombie filters or bloody got face filters. A bit scary for my kids and definitely a bit above their age, in my opinion.",
i have 1 problem with it. once i got it it showed call volume and when i go to turn up my volume it turns up my call volume and normally that doesnt come up unless i am in a call and i have looked and looked multiple times to see if there was a way to get rid of it and i can not find any way to get rid of it,
It's good for kids so they dont send inappropriate stuff and they can't because messenger won't let it send and the parent or guardian can see all there texts if you have the app or screen time but you have to pay for screen time .I would 100% reccomend to someone you know that has kids.,
Pretty good just dont like when its 8 and out of sleep mode well i cant call or text! This gets quite annoying yet if you wanna play among us with like a friend you can go to among us without leaving the call,
I love this app it has done so much for me I just love it sooooo much! I can chat to my friends and fam that live far away and I love how u can grow and play a pet. This app i recommend for younger children since parents can look at the messages and i just looove this app so much! I can chat to friends on what is happening in holidays and facetime everyone it is an AMAZING app you should get.üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ,
This app is really good but in all calls when u say something there's an eco that is really annoying and when u try to send a link to someone it says unable to send message try sending it without a link but it is a link,
Soooo fun I get to talk to my friends and video chat with them I can send cool stickers and pictures and videos there are very very coolüòé filters but when I ask my mom to send people a friend request she does but the people don't get the request üò° I very much like if that could be fixed,
"I think that Messenger Kids is a GREAT way for kids to communicate during Covid-19. Yes it can be a little laggy sometimes, but I think that all kids should be able to call and text their friends so thins is a great app!",
Child accidentally logged out of account on her device and now i cant log her back in. We have uninstalled and reinstalled several times and nothing works. It does not make any sense to constantly have me verify my FB account and still not be able to open the selected profile.,
"Super fun way to communicate with friends including text, video call ext. Fun games and cute and funny filters and ways to interact safely. And it is free!",
This is the most frustrating app. The only friend my daughter wants to use this app to chat with and her name isn't searchable to add her. Her mom sent an invite to use the app and the child definitely has an account. Putting the code in on my daughter's account sends a request to my account with no way to approve it. This friend is the reason I downloaded the app and the only person it's impossible to add as a contact. It also has less fun filters than my Facebook messenger.,
"Coming from a kid like me, I think this is a great app to talk to people you know! The parents can control who you are friends with, they can monitor your chats, and see who you talk to most! It's an amazing app for parents who want their kids to be able to talk with others but want to see what they're doing! Also I have a suggestion, maybe for the colors you could add grey, black, and maybe white :)",
"it works great! the only problem i have is that i thought I'd only need one account for my two young children, so i put both their names on the first one...needless to say, they now each habe one, but i can't change the name on the first one. other than that, we are all happy with it.",
I hate how I can't delete spelling mistakes when talking. I know deleting text isn't a thing for safety reasons and so people don't send your child strange messages and I'm being a big baby and winning over nothing. in reality I've had no problems with this app,
"This is a very good app especially for me it's so easy to flex and show off and and really really good for kids like me but the reson I gave it 3 stars is because of its sleep mode that is annoying very very annoying It would be better if you remove that sleep mode. And, Hats off to this app. And the another reson now I am deleting this app is it's sigh in problem after 2-3 days",
"Omg omg omg this is the best thing ever! Kids have always wanted something like this! I love playing the games, talking to my friends, and most of all, calls! Thank you soooooo much for creating this app!",
how to change your things because I cannot get into this because it won't let me keep freezing up every time I try to do my Facebook not working so I am just going to I'm just going to uninstall this and that exactly what I did right now now I will change it if you guys change how it works. I'm sorry I'm getting this work but you lazy to get a splinter sorry it needs to show me something better than what I already see from this app please can you give me a better app,
"For some reason I cant get it to download to my son's phone. I have tried everything to get it to dowload but all it ever says is ""download pending"". kind of a bummer when the phone is new and we haf si much fun playing with it on my phone first and then it refuses to download.",
"Love this app for my kids. They can message their friends and cousins, as well as other family members, so easily. It helps to keep them in contact with everyone aftr we moved.",
"It's a really fun app that let's you talk to others, and it's for kids too! I use messenger kids to talk to my friends who don't really have like actual messenger, so we use messenger kids, on my tablet I can't text so I use messenger kids, and it allows me to play games and to talk and chat with others.",
The app is eh they should update the filters and whenever I got on the app to see my friend it said logged out so I logged back in and it says some things wrong try again later and I did it so many times and that was the last time I saw my friend so idk and the call is do glitchy and it took a day to send I message I said to my friend to send and it didn't let the bitmoji like yk so it's a eh,
"It's a Great app, and I love that you can save pictures, and get stickers, but it would be nice if you can save videos too. 100% recommended",
On my other tablet I got this and I love it it's easy to find your family and friends all you have to do is put in the code or ask your parents to add someone but one thing that I don't like is this girl showed up randomly and only face times me so I did block her and it's fine now but that was skechy üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è,
Hello im trying to sign up my Facebook account and when i do the whole process and go to the agreements and click create account it says its failed to create it üò°üò† i close the tab of everything on the Phone and still it wont work! This is so annoying because im not letting my own Child use my Phone to text her friends and i need my Child to text her friends so she can have some interaction without bothering the whole household üò°üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†üò§,
"I like the concept but I cant figure out how to add more contacts as a parent, app only has option for child no way to switch from parent to child and Visa versa other than when you first sign in.",
"I. LOVE. THIS. It's super easy to use, rarely laggy, (I mean RARELY,) and really safe! What I mean is, in order to put a friend on, you have to get adult confirmation, and you need their code. I am so happy I have this, because I can talk to my best friends, one of which now lives in Ohio. Now, it did go through this period where it wouldn't let me text, but it didn't last long. Less than a day. I love this!",
We love this app. We can completely control who our son can talk to and set times when calls can't be made or come through. We didn't want to get our son a cell phone but wanted him to let us know when he got home from school. He gets home facetimes my wife our I and it's great.,
"So fun! Love to connect with friends especially in Covid! I can do filters and message!! I say get it! No ads too!!! And for any parent, this is NOT facebook, u can see the chats, and U can add ur childs friends!! :)",
Great idea and my daughter loves it to be able to stay in touch with loved ones. You know they are safe because only you can control who she can message and you can control the times the app works. I love this app.,
"My daughter and I like the app. But it isn't available on all devices. My daughter has a Samsung Tab3 and we can't even find the app in the play store. So far, that is the only problem I have come in contact with this.",
"its great although I downloaded it on my computer for 2 months i was able to use it, now im not I also wish I was able to send gifs from my actual keyboard that would be nice. And that I could adjust my profile pic because sometimes it's not how I want it most of the time",
hey good app here! works perfectly and even 3 year olds could have a bit of fun. but when it needs updates instead of making it so that you cant see contacts just put a little screen saying: update needed. thank you!,
I love the app but you absolutely need to do bug fixes. Because whenever I try and use a filter glitches me out of the app and I tried one more time and log me out of my account and I keep having to ask my mom to send me back in and she's getting annoyed by it. Could you please fix this?,
I use this app to talk to my daughter but I cannot use my Bluetooth with it my Bluetooth headphones do not work with it. Can you please get back with me thank you. Besides that the app is awesome,
"This would be fantastic if I had the option to have multiple children on one device. Not everyone has the means to purchase multiple devices. Not to mention, my children do not and will have have a cell phone until they can purchase one!",
Love it if your kid has a tablet totally get it and they can text her friends and they just love it I think it's really good because the kids they can text her friends and it's like if it's quarantine like in 2020 we headed to quarantine because of covid-19 they texted each other and they loved it I'm at the FaceTime and all that so totally download it yes yes,
"Frustrated- my child is trying to video chat with a group of 6 to 7 people, which we have done in the past. Today, it is not working and keep getting a ""You are not contacts on Messenger. The person you are calling will receive a message request to connect."" And then a pop-up message at the bottom of the screen says, ""No permission to start conference calls for this group."" Now, we are contacts and connected, so what is the problem why we can't video chat today?",
"It's good of course, but my only question is why gifs are blocked. I talk to my own kid when we're apart and I can't send them any kind of gif, even emojis. Might sound weird, but its kind of annoying.",
I absolutely love this app it's a great app but recently me and my friend on this app could not be able to get the notification that me and her are texting or calling so could you please fix that I'm pretty sure it's a bug,
It's so great when I didn't have this app i had to always use my mom's message + app. My mom can control the contacts i wonder how that works. Message plus is good to I'm not saying this app is bad but message + is sooooooo boring glad you made this app thanks Facebook creators!!!üòÉ (I'm a kid.),
"I loved the app UNTIL, I got mad and I uninstalled it, and then I installed it and I couldn't get into my old account!! I was heartbroken to see all my friends and family members on an account that doesn't answer anymore so pleaseeeee I beg of u, give me back my old account!!!! üôèüôè üò≠üò≠üò≠",
It is really just a text app that uses up all your data and internet and my perents see EVERTHING including who i text exactly what i sat and what they say. I wouldnt recomend it unless you want to know everything your kid is doing. So i give it 3 stars,
"My experience has been good with my kids using it. I just feel it needs some upgrades. Let kids react and reply to messages. Also, let them be able to chose a profile pic from their gallery.",
It's overall really good I love that I can chat and call my friends on this app it's fun and the filters are so cute but I can't nickname or change my profile through my gallery and it bugs me because all of my other friends can!!,
Great app but it hangs up on me and my besties calls an hour or more in to our video chat and I don't like it because we're trying to call each other right now and it's not working it just hangs up and says no one called each other then when I get it I get the the calls I press answer but,
Some of the functions of this app don't exist in the adult version. When my kid is playing a drawing game with me I can't send him back drawings. There should be a way to enable these functions on the regular version of Messenger.,
"AMAZING! A perfect way for kids to learn how social media works, and how to use it, I feel extremely safe allowing my children to use this app, and that doesn't happen very often. The kids and I LOVE this app!!!!!",
I can't see his message people are sending him. I hit download Android. But i still can see anything. I hit uninstall. And now im reinstalling the app. We'll see how that works.,
"App will no longer allow us to login. Parent FB login credentials are entered correctly. Child name/account is then selected, but continue to receive error ""ooops, something went wrong""",
"Why can't kids mute their own friends, the only option they have is to report or block. If they are being bombarded by messages, they should be able to mute conversations to avoid upsetting their friends but create boundaries for themselves when they are feeling pressured to respond.",
I really like it because you can message and facetime friends and family. and you can play 1 player games and 2 player games there is one i really like because you can grow your pet and i just really love it,
Love the concept but we cannot get past taking a picture. I get an error message repeatedly and it won't load. Fix it for five stars!!,
Nice app I always talk to my friends and play with them all the time but theres one small problem when I make a video and send it to my friends it say it's only aboe to make a video five minutes long so pls make it infinite time.,
I like it it's fun but my friend tried to have an online birthday party but not everyone was friends and it turned out to be a disaster. Other than that it is a good app but it took like 3 days to download.,
Great app to keep in touch with my child when she is with family or friends. I love it ! Also cam keep in constant contact woth my nieces and nephews safely knowing they wouldnt be able to contact strangers.,
"I like that everyone assumes that everybody has a facebook acount or a phone. Which, neither I have. It would be wonderful if you woudnt need the same things every time, I know thats to protect kids, but it's kinda discouriging tbh..",
"I entered my Facebook credentials 10 times on my child's Samsung A8 device. I quadruple checked it, I even changed my password and it keeps asking me for the parental password so that I can log on to kids account to initiate messenger. I've done the one time password that is suggest and It still doesn't work because it loops back to asking for my credentials. I give up on this crapware.",
"New update to add contacts or setting for my child's account gave me the loading disk with grey screen. Can't back out or move forward, and have to shut the application down. Is it still being supported?",
I love this app!!! But every time someone calls it pulls up a couple hours later. And with my notifications if pulls up the next day. Other than that this is a great app.,
"Loved the old layout was easy for kids. New update is horrendous, you can't even see the names of the contacts. Really disappointing and hard for kids to use.",
This app is great you should download it me and my cousin use it everyday talking together you should definitely use this app it's so much fun we always FaceTime it's so much fun even talk change your photo change how you feeling emotions you can add as many people as you want I love it thank you for working on this app for usüòÑ,
"This is not the best app for android users,everytime I log into my Facebook page and I put in my daughter's name and date of birth and I press continue and it says Account creation failure!Literally I couldn't experience any of it I thought it would be fun for my daughter to have fun and message but I guess not I hope you fix this.",
I love this app! The parents gets to choose who they can add and they get notification when any kind of calls and text.. best monitoring app yet.. and for older kids they dont know that mom and dad gets to see word for word what's getting talked about!!! I give it 10 stars,
"90% of the time I don't receive notifications, and when I finally do it'll show I have msgs and calls weeks before. Please fix. Seems to be random.",
"It doesn't allow one to know for sure when something has been done correctly... I hear no clicks, or don't get any sort of response, its confusing...",
It is very helpful because I can communicate with my baby siblings when mom doesnt answer. And they can always call me when they need anything. No need of a phone with service. Just a tablet with wifi available.,
Awesome! Only two companies. 1.Me and my friends loose connection constantly. 2.It says people are online when there not (glitchy). But besides all of that me and my friends have the best time!,
"Some games are rigged when I play with frenz even if I get all the questions right it says ""you know each other the same!"" Which is suuuuper annoying pls fix dis or is it just my phone? Anyways other than that awesome game!üòÜ",
I like the fact that my grand daughter can contact family on her own but i can see what shes been saying and help her learn what is appropriate. Shes learning how to communicate and in this time of lock down its very important.,
"I've downloaded on daughters android phone. Signed in to my fb, then get as far as entering her name and birthdate...hit submit and get 'account creation failure' its been 2 weeks. I've reinstalled the app, tried on different devices. No luck. I got fb just so we could use this app.",
Love the app it's perfect for my kids they love it if your kids are board of the regular phone app to call people then you should definitely get this for your kids üòâ and only you can control who they text from your phone it's perfect!!!,
"Great way for kids to stay in contact, while maintaining parental safety features. Not just a messaging app, has pretty cool ways for kids to interact and play games",
"This app, though amazing has one MAJOR problem. The one kid per parent rule. Its just inefficient, cause me and my little sister have to share an account. another flaw is that i cannot see the messages. Only my little sister can",
Great needs some improvement - time limits dont work correct. If set from 9pm to 9am once midnight hits it unlocks. Would be nice if it was locked the entire time.,
"l just got to say l am not the type of kid that likes devices but l shure love this app with all of the games, l think if you where to get this app it would not be a waste of time at all. the only thing that l would change is if you write something incorrectly it would change it.",
This is a cool app but i am giving four stars becase i think that you dont need codes to friend people you could just search them up and choose by there profile. Also i have a problem i cant see the photos or videos my friends.,
"Its Amazing, i Just love that i can talk to all my friends and familly all over the world,Just one thing though i think in the video chats i think you should add an icon so that i can turn my video on and off not just the mic, but other than that i love this app.üëçüèæ",
"Very good for kids and parents, it's easy to use and allows parents to limit there child's texting times.",
Really good app especially through Quarantine my daughter has been texting her friends through it all the one problem is it doesn't let you upload photos from your gallery to be your profile picture that's all thanks,
I LOVE this app!! If you wanna know why its because its fun texting friends and its so easy to do things. Its also easy typing people's code. Thanks for reading!,
So far we are VERY impressed with this app. Love the parental controls and allowing our daughter to have contact with her friends during this time of having to stay home during the coronavirus. Thank You Facebook!,
The app is great for video chatting and texting but sometimes it can be frustrating and slow whether or not you have a fast internet connection.,
"Great concept, however it doesn't work Samsung Chromebooks. Chromebooks, which is all our girls have. So they still want to use my phone, which doesn't help me at all.",
"Worked great first month...literally one month to today, then stopped working, wont do anything..tried deleting and reinstalling still wont work. Super frutrasted! >:(",
I love this and its great for parents who want there kid to be safe while talking with family .But a glitch is when me and friend are in a game together we cant hear each other then it ends the call. So please try and fix this glitch!,
Its so nice i love how i get to talk to my friends defintley no regrets you should totaly use this appüòÅüòÅüòÅ it is sometimes very laggy but still defintley FIVE STARSüëçüëçüëç. Plus i am a 9 year old and its so amazing to me if their was a complaint it would be when you are on the phone and someone else trys to call you you get no notfications but in my opinon i give it five stars you should too welp hope this helps you download the app.,
I love it!! I wish that it there was a rainbow color though because it would be so cool. I also wish kids could upload photos from there device. Otherwise I love the app.,
Too much to add friends and family. Steps needs to be simpler than all this extra security to get through. It's easier getting through TSA than using this app,
Love this app so much and I have it on my tablet and I can text my friends and my family and it's so awesome sometimes my friend do funny things and we should talk and talk like I don't know how long but it's so fun to just see your friends even during this covid-19 or you can't see them so this app is super fun and you can just like you funny things with the little pictures and it's fun so I hope you enjoy the messenger app and I hope you get to learn more about it so enjoy the messenger app,
"So my Experience on this app is AMAZING but one thing I think they should add is a button that whenever you call someone it gives you an option saying ""are you sure you want to call_____________?"" Other wise this is a great app! Have a good day!",
"This is a good app overall. I like that I can communicate with my family, send videos, and send stickers. It's a good app and hopefully more people can use this app.",
Whenever I try to call somebody instead of it letting me call them it just lets me click the button and it doesn't do anything I am lucky it will me answer my calls. And instead all of hearing my friends I hear a weird beeping noise. This app sucks I suggest you don't download it!,
I love this app!!! I am always on it. Although can you please fix the lagging. Also can u bring back the panda filter please!!!! I can definitely recommend this app! üòÑ,
The notifications are useful. I'm not sure if it has voice messaging. This app has file sharing.,
The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because whenever I am adding a contact for my child it says connection timed out. It is very annoying please fix this!,
"I have been trying to set up an account for my daughter to talk with her friends at school for 3 days now and keep getting. ""Account creation failure. Something went wrong while creating your child's account. Please try again"" I sent an email with no response. Any reason this is happening?",
"Great messenging app for kids,you can add all your friends and your parent is in charge of who you add and can see all your messages so your parent can make sure your not saying anything bad and you can report or block someone if their being rude you can also turn off someone's notifications so you don't get any of heir notifications,great app for kids",
"I like the app, it allows you approve all contacts and if you have the app downloaded on your device as well you can see all of the messages.",
"I cant even log it!!!! It say ""fail to create your account"" and I tried with so many other emails and it didn't even work!!! I would give the app negative 10 star if I could! Don't even try to download it.",
This is to bleach my__ eyes I think it's a great app and I am a kid so stop crying like a baby and appreciate what you have and don't make a fuss about it and yes I am like this in real life and if you don't like it... UNINSTALL IT it's so simple okay? And to all the one stars: the app is trying there best for a great experience for your child maybe it's your SOFTWARE!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üòßüòßüòßüòßüòßüòß,
I really love the parental control of adding and removing of friends one thing I would like to see is were parents can see the messages between the children and their contacts from the parents Facebook either way my daughter absolutely lives this app and is happy to keep in contact with her friends,
Overall great game! Just takes a long time to add a friend if your parents have to add them. Great way to talk to friends tho.,
"I just live that she can actually text & it is safe!! Also, I love that it teaches her @ an early age (8+) that it's normal for parents 2 b involved with any social media she's involved with, regardless of her age!! Great idea 4 an app.",
Suggestions for improvement: 1. Add a parental control that requires parental approval prior to every video call (to stop kids nuisance calling repeatedly) 2. Should be able to set sleep mode times for each individual day. 3. Should be able to read kids messages (incoming and outgoing) from parent's device. Otherwise good.,
This app is amazing. But here in Alabama it won't let me or my brother text untill the very next hour because of the time diffrinces. But other wise it is a very awesome. Hope you all love it or get it. This app is also supervised by your parents. So they can see everything that you do on it. So if you are doing something that they don't like. They can see it.Hope you like and get messenger kids. P.S. It is beter than whats app.,
I wish there was an adult version!!! I use this not for kids but to approve who can contact me. If you are not on my list you can't message me. This app is the only way I will have messenger on my phone.,
"its great, but you need to fix this certain glich. when people call me, i ont get the call. when i try calling them, it says its not responding. ive tried everything. fix this please. its been going on for a long time now.",
it was great! until i uninstalled it. now i have no way of contacting my friends because every time i try to log in it says 'this user isnt allowed to use this device' or something.,
I like that my grandson can only call or video with whomever I choose for him. The stickers are nice too. He really loves to video with his Papa who is an over the road truck driver and is only home every couple of weeks. Thanks for the app.,
They randomly deleted my sons account. He did nothing wrong and they came up with an excuse that he was repeatedly sending in appropriate messages. I control the baby's account. He sent nothing.... He's a baby. Beyond upset right now.,
"Unable to sign up either of my kids. I've attempted to reach out to the Messenger Support team, but have yet to receive a response after several months. I was born, raised, and live in the US, but still get warnings about certain rights for those in the EU.",
it's a really good because it provides u r kids to talk while u go to work or when ur out somewhere it also fun for kids to call an talk to one another but I personally think it should be nice if u could keep the messenger to be able to go out without needing WI FI I think it better that way because what if there out somewhere and can't call u back so that what I think thank u wrote down from Erica F.,
"For the most part, my son really enjoys the experience of communicating with his friends from school and cousins and family members from around the country... However, if I were to have an option to be able to erase a video msg that was received to the MSGR KIDS account I would give it 5‚≠ê. It apeara to be pretty basic, which isn't a terrible thing but it def needs a parental option to erase mgs and conversation threads. If anyone knows how to, please comment. Thanks in advance!!! Mr. CdK",
This app is awesome. My kids play on this app. Even though we cant go out much to see family and close friends. This app saves that problem. I recomend your child get this app!üòÄ,
"It's a great app, but I would love an option to be able to link to/contact and speak to the other child's parent if I find something concerning.",
I LOVE IT! It is Controlled by Parents u dont get any spam calls no ads KIDS LOVE IT! And u can scroll up and see all ur Messages from the start. good thing to know is u cant Delete messages after u send them but thats not a problem.,
This is a great app for kids to safely keep in touch with their friends with parental supervision. My son loves to send messages and videos to his friends. It's great!,
Its awesome but when i call my lirtle cusin ot stop and i have to re call her lol So ya but its rely good i alwaya have my family and stuff and friends so ya it a realy fun app so but to when i text call her it stop and turns off my phone and ya but atleast it is for kids so ya and i gabe it five stars its a really good app install it for tour kids its fun you can play gamws and grow a pet so ya well my familys a face book people so ya ok i hope u and your kids or kid likes this app and bye!:)!,
My son gets no notifications when he gets a message he only gets notifications when someone calls him he doesn't get notifications when someone texts him hopefully they fix this bug in a update or something,
I love this app it's really cool and I can continue to communicate with a bunch of my friends and I just love it and but I do kind of need a little upgrade on it I wish it was like offline because like some people don't have really good Wi-Fi and all but yeah but I still like it anyway but yeah love it,
"I think it's a great and safe way to teach my kids how to safely use apps like these while they get older. It's also pretty funny to get stickers from my daughters while I'm at work, or while I'm away. lol",
"Absolutely love this app. It gives my kiddo the freedom, yet with some safety. I can see what images are sent and who they are talking to. Seriously recommend.",
"No sound when receiving a video chat, very difficult to get it installed, and hard to add certain people.",
This is the best game ever and because of covid 19 I Can't go to my frands house so I can video chat them so thank you however made this app thank you. Whoever made this happen thank you for making it because because it's a cool thing I can't do to help my friends but now I can and it's awesome so thank you who will remove this appetite like Dave from lamb's eye you will come but this is the best I've ever so thank you very much for helping us because it's really helpful for me and everyone.,
If I could give negative stars I would. It would be nice if I could actually login without it stating my password is wrong (which i changed multiple times). Fix this mess!!,
"It's nice thay my kid can keep in contact with his school friends over the summer. i do wish that it had a ""silence"" feature so if my son is unavailable I don't keep getting calls from his friends.",
"Great parental controls! Out of all the devices/apps we use for our kids this is the easiest, simplistic, and safest app. Love it.",
"i would rate this app a 4 because if u have a chrome book u can't turn ur vid around but thats all that i don""t like about this app and u can also have ur vid off and mute it and talk too ur friend while playing a game!!!!!!!! i also recomend this app its great!!!! so if ur not sure about it u should get it its amazing!!!!",
"Aside from the app being buggy, you removed the game we loved playing there. It's the 'build a wall' with zombies that are walking to eat you. Please bring it back.",
the app is awesome but the app won't let me in anymore the screen goes white for like 10 seconds than goes back to the home screen I don't know why.,
I do like this app it is really cool I can call my friends and like still play Roblox at the same time but something that needs to be fixed is I have more than 10 friends and I can't find one friend I can't find her on my contact so maybe fix that and I will give it 6 stars,
My son loves keeping up with friends through all of this craziness. It's great to see him interacting with other kids. I also like that the games are to use with friends and there are limits on how much time he can spend with the pets.,
I love meggenger kids I 10000000000 percent recomend downloading it. before I got the real texting app I had this I chated with my friends while playing roblox you can play mini games on there and take funny photos but you can only facetime through but yes it is a great app :)),
Love this app mostly because I can chat with my friends but can you maybe make it so you can exit out of the app when your on the call because our call gets Disconnected when me and my friend are trying to play Roblox so please fix that and can you make it so that you don't need wifi to call or text please thx,
This app is great! My only wish is that I could add adults to her friends list who are not on my Facebook. It's a good way to stay connected.,
Having problems with video chatting freezing on my daughter's tablet. Tried reinstalling it but it is still doing the same thing.,
no sound notifications to let either party know about a message received and days for some messages to send & come through on both ends. fix this and this will be a great app,
"This app only work's on certain phones... keeps giving error that no account was found. But when I logged in through an older phone it found it , so frustrating that only 1 of my kids can use it",
I love this app because its easy to talk to friends but I do have one thing wrong with this app is that I dont have a phone I have an iPod touch witch is just like a iPhone but it will not let me get the app on there so I have to use my grandmas iPhone to use this app and that promblem is if I want to talk to my friends at night I cant. Everything else about this app is great. Thank you for reading. Maya Pajak,
I give this app a rating of 4 out of 5 because me myself I'm (10) and I get to talk to my friends and family on it but there could better filters for pictures and send pics and videos quicker.,
It was fine until it stopped letting me add my kid's friends. It doesn't matter if I press accept or delete the request stays and the other parent can no longer see my kid's account.,
"The reason I'm rating this one star is because many people have left reviews about how the call has no audio, and you haven't done anything. I'd appreciate it if you fix this issue.",
"Good app. Only issue after awhile it stops notifying me of new messages, and I have to manually go into the app to check for new messages, which makes some of my family that I message upset, please fix this",
My grandchildren love it! They are so happy with it. But I really wish that they had stories so that I can see what my grandchildren are up to. I barely ever see them because I'm always traveling with my husband Ike. If they had stories then I could see what they are up to quickly before I'm off to do something.,
"My 7 year old loves messaging family and friends but I'd like it better if she could receive anything from at least me, like action emoji's or gifs. She asks all the time ""why can't I do that?"" and it's because it won't let me let her.",
Best messaging app for kids I am a kid and have normal messenger and still love it.The games are amazing and fun I also like how it gives you different options on games and activites.My friends and family think it is amazing as well.My teacher has a Brother the same age as me and she said he and she loves it her mom is no longer alive and her dad is but everyone in my class loves it as well it also messages parent every time you block some one or want to add some one.I personally think as a kid,
"Messenger kids is a kids safe app that allows anyone to chat or cal. My daughter is calling her friends and family all the time and I can tell it makes her happy, especially during quarentine!",
I am able to message and video chat my friends and loved ones. I don't know when to stop! OR if there is even an end to this marvelous app! You should definitely download this! √Änd rate this 5 star app!,
it isn't just the first thing you can halp about when 9you say you want a lot to get the best day to be going through a new level and you're still trying and doing it right and you're going through the whole situation to make it easier and easier and harder than that but it doesn't seem that the way it was dinner would make a great game .,
having issues adding adults that i dont have as a facebook friend that they want to talk to. i really dont want to have to add all these people to my own friends list so that they can talk to them..,
I'm a 10 year old girl and I'm giving this app 3 stars because there is a lot of things you can't do like you can't rate a picture sent directly to you or you can't play games while on a video chat. Please fix this! Thank You.,
My mom was having trouble getting this.It was wanting her to do in load face book and I'm only a kid. I don't recommend this if you whant your kid to have face book. I have vary close friends and I can't talk to them just why. I recommend mesinger.,
I would totally give it a 5 star if this app was able to go on an s.d. card because some people have a lot of friends on the app but then they have to do a factory reset so then they have to have a whole new code and lose all there friends and then there friends can find them if they have online school because there friend will have a whole new code and wont know why they cant find them or they wont respond please please pleaseeeee fix this,
Its an amazing app I text my friends but the only thing that bugs me is that you CANT USE FILTERS FOR UR PROFILE PICTURE . i mean c'mon you have filters to take photos and send them to ur friends but u can't use filters for you profile,
"pretty good but every time my daughters maddison, emmalin mira and mara. try to use it it always makes them update the app or it automatically unninstalls and it takes 4-5 hours!!!!ugh it is so annoying!!!",
"Love the idea, although I am Mema not the kid part of this app. Love to communicate with my family, but find this app hard to navigate. That's disappointing to my grandkids and to me also!",
I would have gave this app a five star if you guys could fix the typing and that's all I want to say and I just don't know if you guys could fix it like or is this why I can't download it because I just deleted it a couple of seconds ago and it won't let me download it again cuz I restarted my phone and it won't let me download it again so I'm super sad now cuz I can't text my sister and my cousin and my brother and everyone else that I have on here but yeah this is all I want to say bye guys,
"You should download this messenger for kids, it is so fun because you can text your cousins grandmas grandpa's. I have downloaded, and I have been talking to my cousin, my family members, and it's so funny, you guys should download it, you won't regret it. This app like 247, the time. You could also call the people that you're texting and you could play and send pictures in the soul fun",
"Ok. It's just ok. The app is wildly unpopular which is quite the issue for controlling parents, along with the fact that it is overly sensitive. Every. Single. Message. Sent. Is copied over to the parent, blocking someone notifies the parent 'you should talk to your child about this' and is completely obnoxious on the sensory. Please if you need a messaging app use something better. Not an app where your parents can spy on you as if privacy isn't a thing. I suggest apps such as discord/snapchat.",
"It is a good app to keep in touch with the young people in my life. Personally, this app is appreciated as a tool that allows a healthier relationship among family and friends.",
"My son really like the application since we're all in isolation for the future months. My only problem is that I'm using facebook in english and I can't seem to find how to switch his messenger to french, probably because mine isn't. Can we do that without changing my facebook?",
"Only bad part about Messenger kids is that I have twins and they want me to download the app for the other twin but it wont download again because i already downloaded it on my phone for the first one, they use the same phone. I don't know really how else I am able to do anything for the other profile",
This app is amazing! You can send funny pictures and play games with your friends and family! There's so much to do and play! if you want a fun texting app this is the one for you! like if you agree üòÅüòÅüòÅ love this appüíñüíñüíï,
"I am a 8 year old girl and I LOVE messenger kids! My mom or whoever set you up can monitor what you do on it. And I think it is good to text or video call people to stay in touch especially during these hard times. üòä or üò∑ü§íü§ßüòî with this app you can do this üòä with messenger kids! Highly recommend this app!!!üòä‚ò∫üôÇü§óüòÄüòÑ You can video call, text and group chat! I LOVE messenger kids!",
I love this app I use it to talk to my cousin all the time but I gave it a four because it's really hard to film videos that I want to send her or anyone else in the app because it's only one minute all otherwise great app,
The app keeps crashing causing my lil sis to be utterly disappointed. it's fine one second and freezes the next. too many problems to be properly functioning üò°,
"This app is awesome, I love it. When my kids need something, they text me on either a computer or a phone. Yes you heard me right, I said computers. You can download this app on your computer if you know how.",
It's a good app and all except I'm a little annoyed that when you sign in you cant change the profile picture and the only thing I can do is use the camera and I want to use and picture from my gallery:/,
I love this app! Very easy for a kid and parent to use! I understand that you have to put a face book account in it for it to work but either way it is a great app!,
Great way for family and friends to keep in contact from farand wide. But don't like the fact some of my contacts have sent my daughter friend request. I blocked the user..,
"This is a great app. I got the app cause I could not see my friends cause on covid. If you are a parent and your kid dose not have this app on their phone, download this app it is safe for your kids to have. You can send fun pictures to your friends you can play games when you are on facetime. I personally love this app and I can text safely cause I would text on a different app and I got scammed alot. So I recommend this app for kids.üòÅüòä",
It's a great app for my kiddo. My only complaint is that it doesn't let me send her gifs. But she can send them to me. Other than that I like the parental features.,
this is the funnist game ever and you can do lots of things with your friends and family you make a funny video for them I just love this app and it is better than messager it is for kids it is perfect for your little kids so they can talk to there friends that live far away thank you for reading be safe be kind and bye,
Account creation failure. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling Facebook and it still doesn't work. What a waste of time.,
so good my kid loves this app she text her friends all day and i can video chat with her to and meet her new friends and alot of kids are her age but she never talks to stranger she just talks to her real friends ü§ó i just LOVE the APP GO GET IT NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Its great app but the small choice of emojis sucks and when people send pictures it get really laggy and hard to type.. this app just kinda sucks... its hard to talk to people.,
"since update it will not open, as soon as you click the app it blinks then closes, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app but that did not fix it, even cleared the cache and data.",
"Well it could be better if my son was able to use a picture as his profile picture from the gallery, then it would be better. But the app lacks the nicknames featute.",
"This is the third time I've tried setting this up for my son. I got his messenger kids acct on my phone just fine but when I try to put it on my kids phone it keeps telling me ""check your internet connection"" I tried using the unlimited data which is 4g on his phone and then our wifi which was full bars and both ways kept giving me the same message. I have messaged fb kids messenger a few times before when I tried setting him an account up months ago and no one ever got back to me.",
Its definitly a 5 star app. Really easy to use and figure stuff out. And kids cant text anything bad without there parents finding out. I recomend this app for children and for adults if you want!,
i love it can FaceTime your friends have fun and yeah it's not like messenger.and my kids safe and sound who's always texting her friends on messenger and I think messenger is only for adults they should have their own messenger app this is why I love it because my kid is safe and sound and sometimes that your internet slow and doesn't work,
This game is awesome. There is NO ADS! And you can video chat and message your friends and family . And it is easy to set up . ONLY IF YOU ARE GOOD AT TECH,
"I for the life of me can't figure out how to add the other parent to my child's contact list. even after it sent a message to the other parent saying they could message the child, their messages wouldn't go through.",
"I hate this app first of all because what about the parents that don't have Facebook!!! You need to make it to where people who don't have Facebook can log into this!! I dont trust my daughter to not delete texts so that's why I thought this app would be good, but apparently not!üò°",
Amazing! I've never had a problem. If your a parent and you have facebook messenger it is similar but with kids mini games and is 100% kid friendly. Y'all should get it. üòÄüòäüòÄüòä,
It is good. But I think that each day you should make more than 1 or 2 filters. Sometimes you don't even get new filters for a week or 2 weeks It's really good tho,
pretty great app! but you can't send links....this really sucks....the FaceTime glitches like crazy..but overall a preTTY good app!,
"So, I absolutely LOVE that my son has the opportunity to communicate with family and his classmates. However, no matter how hard I try, I am not able to add my father (his grandfather) to his messenger list (yes we are friends on Facebook.)",
I am a parent and am unable to message my child on the app. I set it up and I'm not showing up on her contacts list. Very poor effort for a large tech company,
Used to not have problems with this app until now. My daughter accidentally broke her phone to where she got another and tried to log her into the messenger. Kept having me attempt to sign her in only to be on a repetitive loop.,
My son is learning how to read and write. Using this app has helped him excel in this because it is fun for him to keep in touch with all of his friends. This is especially true now with all schools online during a pandemic.,
Well I'm not sure if its a good app or not but I hear lots of people saying I signed in perfectly no problem on to my Facebook account and its says there's an error im very disappointed üòî and angry about this which is why I give 1,
"like 300 or MORE meseges were deleted! TONS OF ERRORS LIKE THE THING WERE U CAN AD MUSIC AND I DID IT WITH A GIF AND LATER I GOT PERFECT TIMING SO I SENT IT AND THE MUSIC PART THAT I HAD ON THE GIF WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT I HERD RIGHT BEFORE I SENT IT LIKE THE HECK! AND THE GAMES IN THE APP DONT LOAD EXEPT FOR THE WUD U RATHER, CLRING, AND GROW UR PET! AND WHEN I TRY TO SEND CERTIN THINGS LIKE PIC OF MY in game PET ITS MY APP-THEME COLOR LIKE TRACPARENTY IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN. FIX",
"just set this up for my child, started with it on my phone then got her new tablet and installed it. however it can't find my account when I try to activate it so she can't use it to talk to cousins and friends from her tablet.",
I love this app.. I love that my daughter can enjoy talking to family and close friends without me worrying who she's talking to. This app is the most secure then any app I've EVER used myself in my entire life!!‚ô°,
"this app is horrible. I'm trying to sign my child up for a messanger kids account, but I dont have an email hooked up to my account, so I used my alt email. then it said that messanger kids isint in my region. my child has snapchat and other apps she can use to text, but one of her friends can only have messanger kids because of their parents. so I know it's available in my region because my child's friend has it who lives right by us. I dont understand why it is doing this.",
While I was in the process of downloading this app I was reading the reviews and when I got to the one where her 11 year old son our don't his friends I stopped b/c that is the reason I am downloading this app to be more close to my friends so I pressed the cancel button and didn't even download it. I gave you 1 star b/c the reviews are not even being answered by the people that own the app. And if I go on another app they will at least have 1 review answered. I have reached my maxim writing,
"How come my child can't pick a picture from her gallery, but the other kids can? Is it because her phone is an android and not an I-phone. Please add a feature that allows my child to set her profile picture, from a picture from her gallery, bye and thanks",
The kids love it even though sometimes it has it's glitches where it doesn't allow me to add friends for them. But overall a fun experience.,
"It won't stop giving me ""your app went to sleep"" pop ups. Even as I was in the middle of writing that, messenger kids opened their OWN app, just to tell me I couldn't use it. Remove this SUPER annoying bug and I'll give a better review. üò†",
I checked my volume and I couldn't hear my friends at all because my volume is all the way up everything was up and I still couldn't hear them at all if it's a problem for everybody else please give me yes on this review please fix it if you have a chance thank you,
Love this app so good! Just 1 problem some of the good filters go :< and sometimes scary filters come and scare the childern like when your mount became your eyes thank god that got removed :< but it scares the childern even the older ones,
Loved this app but after the last update the app crashes immediately after opening. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.,
"I hate the inconsistencies. I had to redownload it for my daughter and create a new account, and when I did that she couldnt add nicknames for people, or play with her pet or anything.",
"Daughter loves using this to keep in touch with family members that don't live nearby. I love that the parent controls the contacts, and she loves sending funny pictures and doing video calls!",
I love the app for my son to chat with his friends but my son asked me why he cant set his profile picture to a picture that he likes. If you could add that as a feature then he would be very happy,
"I LOVE this app there is nothing wrong with it, but the only thing I would want to add is, backgrounds because the parents have them and the backgrounds are really cool.",
I love this app!! It's controlled by parents! I might be a kid but this app is amazing!!!!!! Its a great way for your child to contact friends/family!!,
4 stars cuz when im tryna do something sometimes i get a bunch of texts„ÄÇalso it lags sometimes„ÄÇ but i got to text my crushÔºåmy three friendsÔºåand my parents and grandparents„ÄÇ I suggest you download this„ÄÇ,
this is a good app you can make group call's but some time's the call with some v1one disconnected some time but this fine becuse it only happen's a little and plus it conneted and if not just leave the call and call back and you can take pic's and vid's play game's with friend's you can pick your color of your messenge's pick your name get a picture for your profile so if i was you i would of already get it and make it 5 stars but thats me not you but i would .,
I absolutely love this app. I am in complete control and i can talk to my daughter when im not with her. It's like giving her a phone without really giving her a phone. Thanks,
"I can't even get to the stage where you video call your friends. It needs a Facebook account to verify that your an adult. We entered these details and it just said 'no internet try again later.' Very frustrating, don't waste your time.",
"Its the best, you can talk with multiple friends and text! It is perfect for iPad or tablets that you can't message on. I love it!",
"The app won't recognize my son's existing profile when logging in. It asks me to create a new profile. The really aggravating thing is that when it asks me to enter my password, it shows me that he has unread messages!",
Freezing. Used this app for awhile just fine. Suddenly the app started freezing with each video call,
This is a great way for my daughter to keep in contact with her friends Durning this crazy time in life. I feel secure with her communicating with others with the ability to monitor the conversations.,
I love this app. Kids are communicating more with family that lives away. Would give 5 stars if...I want to add adult who has regular messenger but not a FB account. I can't see how to do this.,
The best app ever communicate with people that you haven't been easy in a while and you could but FaceTime it people but I would like the address of the people make the game that they make that you can just regular call them I really like this game and it's a really good game so I suggest you download this this is a game that it's so good that you should download it especially during quarantine,
"Just added my daughter and I cannot add friends and family, it does not allow me to do anything, waste of time to add.... No help button, menu or anything. Not getting any messages from her..... Extremely dissapointed",
Like this app also helpful because of covid-19 i get to chat with my friends but when your friends get annoying you can turn off your notification just that one person! Lol,
"This app,was perfect,WAS!Now that I've had it for a while it is really starting to suck!It keeps exiting me out when i try to text people!I wanted the app so I could contact my sister who live 3 days away!But,that wont work because this stupid apps exits me out!?Tell me why and how to fix it and maybe after I see how it works afterwards I'll MAYBE keep the app!Thank You for your concern if you truly care!",
I love the app but it would really be nice for the kids to be able to play FB games with their contacts. My son keeps wanting to play against me on some things but he cant.,
It's fun to text and call people that really all I like that you can use filters that's fun also its really cool you can play games with freinds during calls my only problem is the grow your own pet thing it's boring and gitchy so pls make that more fun,
"When I tried to set up an account for my kid it always claimed there was an error, after looking up how to fix it I found many people could not log in, this app needs fixed.",
"This app is total garbage... Just like Zuckerberg!! Whenever I try to call my kid it rings on the phone I am using. So it's like i am calling myself, Then I have to decline my call and my child sees the missed call notification on her end and calls me back.",
This is an ok calling app for kids but the.only thing is if you try to delete a text it does not let you and for blocking it sends an alert to the parents phone when they dont need to know but on the other part it's good for kids,
within the app is impossible to ask questions and get help . very complicated approvals process. Not well explained. very disappointed kid. it would be great if the app wd be user friendly,
It wont finish downloading and open up to use. I tried creating to different accounts. Neither finish downloading or opening.,
"I am a kid who is righting this.The app is amazing for kids if you dont have a phone with data.I have a phone(its my moms old phone) and i have no data meaning i cant call or text people.This app is totaly safe for kids and i completly recomend it to kids who want to call or text family or friends,while parents can cotral it.",
Great app so far. It's a shame you have to be facebook friends with the other parent to add them as a parental control. Other than that we've had no real issues.,
"I'm trying to create an account and for some reason I cant even create it. I want to talk to my friends but it doesn't let me I closed the app and reopen it. It said ""could not find account"" -)-)-",
Its horrible! I cannot talk with my friend! It keeps stopping our video chat every five seconds! This is the worst app ever!,
Great app! The only things are the games dont work or stick often and i wish there were more filters! A bit disappointed though!,
Its a good app but the one problem im facing is that my step daughter has a mixed family with more than two parents i cant find how i can add a third parent and its getting irritating.,
Hello i LOVE this app but two problems with it i cant change my profile pic and when ever i text my mom its veary slow but can your next update be that we can change our porfile pic with out bugs geting in the way üòä but otherwaise this is a grate app keep up the good work!,
So hard to add a friend using parents account (my account) It keeps on saying that I should have the updated facebook but then my facebook is up date. It's been almost a month and until now It wasn't resolve. Useless app.,
"This app is great! The only reason i rated it 4 star is because i recently tried call someone on this app and they did pick up but, i could not hear them. But if i could i would rate it 4 stars and a half!",
"I have tried numerous times to download this app and it never works. I get a message that something has gone wrong and to try again later. Changed my review, it is now working!",
"my daughter loves this to app. she uses it to talk to aunts, uncles, and cousins! ican keep an eye on it and know exqctly who she is talking to. and not just anyone can message her, everyone added has to be approved by me first!",
Nice app needs more work landscape orientation doesn't work. Has some bugs but my daughter's likes it and its a good way of keep in touch with her friends,
I have only used two times. It has nice features and is quite user friendly. It's super nice when you're social distance just want chat.,
Love MESSENGER KIDS!!!!!üòÜüòÉI am only 10 years old and love but my question is that why is it connected with Facebook?? Oh well overall love it you can do funny videos but i am only here to say keep up the good work!! PS.i really mean it.,
Its good app for kids so they can talk to there freinds but it tends to not send messeges.and gets really slow on facetime but other than that i defenetly recomend this app for kids my daughter loves it!,
This app is not the best it is so slow and wont connect to my phone. It comes up with stuff like pets and drawings anyways I can only FaceTime and it is so slow I am disappointed in this app,
This is an amazing and safe way for kids to keep in touch with their friends and family as its completely supervised by their parents but it's also fun and gives them that sense of independence too. Highly recommend,
Love this App ‚ù§üíØ I always know my daughter is safe using it. I get the alerts if she gets messages or calls from her friends. I can rest assure she will always be having fun and having a safe social media time,
Calls are really glitchy. And dosen't notify properly. Plus it often takes hours for messages to send.,
Doesnt Work. Cant get passed the screen to verify an adult is setting up. Freezes and blinks on the screen.,
A wonderful app for children. My son loves talking to and seeing family members and I have complete confidence he's safe. No weirdos picking up little kids online. Just chatting with grandpa and sending funny pictures to his cousins.,
It's been great. My daughter loves this app she understanding why I have done this because I shown her on my message how other are not all good so she happy of this app that daddy keeps the bad out but still feels like she has full run to do things like a grown up.,
"I love this app, Don't have a problem, just want screen share. So I can show people a game reccamenation to my friends or something. Other then that this is a good app.",
This is awesome for your friends that don't have their own phone. I have a phone but 1 of my friends doesn't so we both have this and our parents can check on their own phone and see what we do on there,
"This is a very nice App that allows my daughter to communicate with friends and family. She still uses it in conjunction with Verizon Family, now that she has her own phone.",
"Messenger kids works very well for me in terms of the communication aspect, but if I try to put up a picture of my face on it, it doesn't work, and I find it quite frustrating.",
No Account Found - Tried to enter my FB account info for authorization but it says no account found. I've tried to reach out to multiple sources for help but have received no response.,
I love it I can talk to friends and my parents get to be involved in it I have over 48 contacts the only thing is i want more filters but other than that I absolutely love my friends and family love its like messenger but for kids so it's not inappropriate at all I hope I helped you I think I should of used five stars it's so good.,
Really good but the call ends randomly sometimes but it is fine and allso my friend she has a i pad and for her profile pick she can choose from her gallery but i cant with my samsung tablet but over all great app and will telling my friends to get it easy to set u to,
"Messager kids is the best! I haven't seen a lot of my friends much cuz coved but I know it is great! There is so many things to do, you will never run out of fun!!!",
"I was able to open this app just fine on my phone, but it keeps crashing on my son's tablet. That's the whole reason i downloaded it! Very disappointed! Please fix issues.",
"It's terrible, I have all of my mom's contacts, but when I tried to add another person and my mom aproved it the stupid app doesn't do anything. I have been working on it all day and nothing worked, it's stupid.",
This app is fantastic! I use it a lot to call my friends and the quality is amazing! I highly recommend this app if you are looking for a free calling/texting application.,
Minors can't use the app. They HAVE to sign in using an account that is 18+ even though it's an app made for kids. I'd like to message family on here... but can't.,
"I am a kid so, it's a great app talking with my besties on face time and I get notifications even if I'm off the app! It's a good app to use and the funny thing is, we each get a weird funny code!",
"Not liking the factors and be used on both my kids devices. Donloaded it to one just fine, went to do it to the other end it comes up with the first child's info... Should be a way for both kids to have it separately",
Won't work. When creating my son's account a message keeps coming up saying something went wrong please try again and when I try again and again like it says. It says I exceed this function try again later.,
Great way to stay connected with friends and family and so caretakers know that you are being nice and not doing anything bad I love this if you want to help your kid ‚ù§Ô∏è stay connected with family and friends and being able to say what they are saying this is the app,
"I don't know what is going on, it won't let me log in it always has problems and I haven't speaked to my cousin in a few months...and I just really want to but, it always has problems to log me In. I get on the last part of loging in but it has a fail for some reason",
"it's ok for what it is but would prefer to monitor the content (what's being said in chat) . They are kids thus they have no need for privacy in my opinion .if I wanted complete freedom , I'd have created a Facebook profile.",
"It's okay, just time to time it logs you out which makes it worse. Would be a lot better if you could make nicknames and put it in dark mode",
"Good app except when you use a sound in your video, the sound is delayed REALLY BAD with the video.",
I really like i mean i do not like it i love ittttttt!!!!.....it is soooo great for my kids it is safe it is good becos whatever she messenge to her friend i can see it and there is habbit something and its like puzzle that habbits she was trying to do it after we had lunchü§óü§óü§£i love it sooooo much!!!!,
The games make this app useless and addictive for kids instead of actually connecting with their friends they play pointless games during video chats and don't even talk to each other. Simplify this app and it would be great.,
"Kids love it, but for parents there needs to be a way to sync the app between parents because it shows two instances of the child. Also make a simplier way to disable calling on patent device vs kids device if used",
I would give it full stars but I cant pick a profile picture from my gallery and my friend can cause she uses a apple ipad and I don't so can you please allow it on all devices so everybody can pick a picture from their gallery if they want.,
"The app is saying it's asleep when it's supposed to be available to use. Got logged out and now it won't let me login again, keeps saying something went wrong. Help please.",
I can talk with my friends for FREE I love that app the only reason I am putting 4 stars is fr some reason I cant change my favorite color anymore and games take a while but I don't really care I still love this app I hope this is helpful!,
It's amazing if you're a kid and you don't know how to text you can just hit this button and then you can text like it's amazing and you can face call it all I know you don't like just ready other high was amazing downloads out for free,
Ok app - a little confusing to set up. Would be great if images previewed like in the regular Messenger before sending.,
"I love those app. I use it all the time to contact people, but you can't set up 2 accounts for if parents are divorced because 1 of the accounts will be deleted.",
"So far I have spent hours tying to find a way to delete my daughter's account. There is no way to do it. I have emailed support, got no answer. Fun to use with kids but has no real account control at all.",
I love this app it makes all fun edits and calls and when you text someone you no if they seen it and when there texting back and you can see if there available,
it is awesome exept on my tablet it takes almost 2 days for a message to send when you friend is offline. but it amazing yuo have cool codes to giveto yuo friend to also text you. and parents can see it too. It De BEST,
App won't allow me to add any contacts to my child's account it just circles tried several different devices and the same not sure what's going on but I'm thinking about deleting the app,
It's very good and not very glitchy but my son has run into a problem with links. I gave him permission to send links but it still says he needs permission. If you fix this glitch it would be 5 stars,
I like the app. My kid enjoys talking to me and her mom and everyone else... My only thing I would like to see added is the ability to turn off and on video chat and calls.,
Now this is a game if you want to like talk to your friend that's not really a game okay it's like it's kind of like a phone you know it's you can text people I mean I suggested but I actually don't like it it's a good game but sometimes it confuses me and so yeah I suggest it but sometimes I would not suggest it just because it's little little weird you know,
Camera is blacked out when using filter in video calls. Sometimes the filter pops out but my face isn't recognized.,
"All of my friends has this app so I download it,so I signed up from Facebook, but it said that it's not eligible to sign up, so I tried again, but this time it still did not work! I've lost all of my friends just because of this app!üò†",
"It's okay, but no notifications show up for new messages or calls - which kind of defeats the whole purpose of it.",
"Good but theres a problem, it keeps saying ""not able to send message."" And you know? That's really annoying and it happens in the middle of talking to my friend. Please fix this.",
"Seems like a good concept. However, it won't let me add another child. Seems to be stuck on 1st kid and app gives no tech support on this subject. üòí",
It's a good app for talking but I always disconnect from calls when I'm far away from somebody and it gets so annoying because when I'm in a middle of a game I have to leave the game because it disconnects,
I love it because I can talk to my friends and l do not think there is one problem but l wish that it was easier to add friends on there become you have to put in the code and if you do not the code it is hard to get into,
It keeps messing up saying there is a issue completing my child's account. It won't let me add my husband at a parental control even though we are friends I can't find him!,
"Louie is NOT my child, he's my husband!!!!!! These are our grandchildren he's talking to! You keep asking me to download the app for him so he can talk to his grandchildren !!! He's older than me, he can do it himself, but I couldn't get in touch with you to tell you other than this.",
"the app should allow chat heads, my son never knows if i message him unless he happens to get online to msg me. we use this app while he is away from hime so it would be super helpful! other than that i think its great!!",
Still cant quite figure out how to set up. On my kids end it says parent confirm when they try 2 friend someone but i dont recieve anything. Still figuring out set up but i gave in lol. But i love the concept.,
Audio volume of party contacted is very low and barely audible despite all settings being correct. Can you please suggest troubleshooting ?,
"I love this app because it is a way for kids to have there own text app! You don't even have to pay for it and there is no adds! It is SO safe and you can connect to someone who doesn't even have Messenger Kids! They only have to have Messenger. But this app is amazing! You can even connect to friends! Get this app for your kid! Parents, don't worry, your kid has to ether ask you to request the person or have to enter the other persons code. Get Messenger Kids when ever you can!",
It is very good I am not allowed any other social media type messaging apps so I have this and there's no problems besides that some of my friends doesn't have messenger kids which isn't a problem for any of yous so yep basically no problems or nothing,
Absolutely love this app. My child can talk to my family without keeping my phone all day üòÜ and I can monitor her conversations while she also has a sense of confidentiality.,
i think that when i got this app my kids flew over it texting and calling with friends and they used it all day nonstop the only concern i have is that when they try to send something the press the thumbs up when they dont mean to thank you for making such a great app for entertsainment and saftey,
"It's great, for my 6 yo girl, it works fine, I can choose to whom my daughter can communicate, she can communicate easily using voice mail, video call, or voice call, it also has some drawing feature and many fun selca filter.",
"It's very fun. Me and my friend dont have phones to contact each other so we just use messenger kids. We absolutely are obsessed with warrior cats, so we do texting roleplay with made up characters. 5 stars all da way.",
its great for letting my younger children stay in contact with friends and family. But I would like to be able to delete some group conversations but cant seem too.,
I love this app I'm 9 btw and I'm very frustrated bc I can't text my friend anything I updated it and it says that I need to try again later I did that and nothing and I REALLY want to talk to her and ask if a can call her it's horrible please fix this,
"I have tried and tried to set up an account, now I have 2, that I can't get into...just a circle of death or a repeat of the same agreement over and over no matter how many times you agree.",
"get rid of the ""share Video answers"" thing. this is for children and there's no info on what that game does. my kids don't need to share videos publicly. a lot of parents are separated and aren't friends on Facebook, seems that i can't register the mother as a parent because of this flaw. it's really hard to try and find people to add. they simply don't show up even if i just found them on Facebook in the normal search before going to the parents dashboard",
My phone is ringing or buzzing all day and I have no way to silence it. I had to delete the app. You need to arrange a way a parent can still be notified about what their kids are doing without it ringing to their phone.,
"Great app it's amazing, but when text messages are sent I don't get notifications, I also can not get logged back in to my account even when inputting information correctly",
It's a Great app. I wish kids could be friends without me having to be friends with the parent. I also wish they or I could change the Main Picture.,
"You really need to fix the photi filters, they just keep scrolling and my child can not use them because she cant choose witch one to pick, and then her screen frezes.",
it is a very fun way to connect with your friends but it is a little glictchy and blocks people out.it also black screens us so we cant see each other,
Tried to download app and the logo would keep popping up but would not advance. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling it did the same thing.,
"Notifications are turned on, but I never get notifications. Kind of a worthless feature.",
Great way for younger school age kids to stay in touch. Easily find parents contact info to requests your kids friends if you've never met parents. My daughter likes this app and it keeps her engaged with others well,
"Not a very good app, in the sense that I had to create a Facebook account so that I could use this, only to find out that it wont even let me create an account. I've tried for a few days now and still the same issue. Very disappointed because I need something like this to keep in touch with my child. Something that actually works though.",
So this is one of the best apps in the world you can call kids you can text kids it's really fun even grown-ups can have the app it's really fun you guys should get it no bugs no nothing there so many games you can play it's a texting app but like those games you can send people it's really fun you guys should get it.,
"Took me from launch until today to get it to dwnld. many tries before, all failed. I reached out to support and never got an answer back, but here today, we have messenger kids. My immediate complaint is, I can't share anything with my kid. I added her on FB Messenger so I could send her videos from Facebook and fail. I think any ""adult"" she's allowed to talk to would respect parental guidelines, so please make this an option! I don't want her to have an FB, then she could/would see it all.",
I've been having extreme issues with Messenger Kids. I cannot add one of my daughters to the app. I've tried many many times and it still doesn't allow me.,
This is nice! My 4 yr old son have tablet and I want to videocall him without creating facebook for him. This is a free app and very nice. Very useful for kids and us parents. Thank you for creating this app.,
"It doesn't work for me. I link a parent account. Then input the child's name, then ask for the child's birthday. Then it says ""account creation failed"". With no other explanation and no instruction on what to do. And that's it.",
"it's great other than my child logged out somehow and when I go to log back in it offers me only ""log in with email"" but the problem is my Facebook doesnt run through my email so I have no way of logging her back it . if you could help that would be great",
"It is a fun app that I can use to video chat and message with my friends and family. It is safe for kids and it fun. When you get your own account you can have your own pet, earn badges and take fun pictures.",
I love how I can set times she is able to use the app. She used to wake up early and call everyone on her list or call at night but now she can't use the app between 830 pm til 830 am,
I'm in love with this app I can play games(plus no ads) and talk to my friend any time it even tells me if they are online or offline. This is one of my favorite apps.,
I love it my daughter has autisum and she loves android so i got her and Android tablet and she asked wheres the texting app and i said there isnt one she freaked out so in the play store i seached texting for kids and messenger kids showed up and shes loved it she wont get off the app when its dinner time and she calls her friends every day and shes in love with i am too and i recommend messeger too because its the same but for adults so yeah this app is her life and mine,
"This game is the best it has so many options that you can do. The reason i gave it 5 stars is because i can talk to my friend whenever i want, and i love the filters!",
"Very great app for kids, you can even grow your own pet! This app is perfect for kids, it has many activities to play with! I really recommend this.",
I like the game because you can play games with your friends and facetime them also text them and send them funny pictures and videos please get it but there's some glitches but still get ittttt.!!,
I do love this app the only flaws I could find were sometimes the quality of the facetime can be anoying and glitchy it's also anoying when you can't send a gif but over all a good appüòäüëç,
I love that I'm in control of who my daughter can talk to as well as that I can see who she is calling and messaging!!!I love this app and so does she! There are so many cute effects that's she loves!!!,
It's great bc I can choose who my child talk to but it would be better if I could see the conversations and messages. Not just the images.,
It says it was installed but it wasn't anywhere in my apps. I was actually looking forward to trying this out but due to the fact the I couldn't open it I am putting 2 stars.,
"Trash app. Half of people who try to make an account won't be able to. It will say ""account creation failure"" and never allow you to use the app. Trash.",
"When I used to have it on my old phone it worked but bow it wont let me sign in, it says check your internet connection and try again although my mobile data has full bars and my wifi has full bars PLEASE FIX THIS",
"Great way for kids to talk to their friends, family, and much more! You can make funny photos, and do a guess the drawing game every day one time!",
Its great that it is separate from facebook in a way and that its monitored by parents. The only down side is it cant be used on a computer.,
"i downloaded this app for my son and it glitched out so bad that it froze, i couldn't exit out. then my screen went black and i couldn't reset my phone or anything until i took my battery out!!!! im not happy.",
"I really like messenger kids, but my one flaw is the calls, when your on a call it is very glitchy and laggy and it ends the call randomly, but I would decently recommend this app!!",
This app is awsome!you can call and you can play games with your friends without ending the call!!!!this app can do eneything its so cool you can pick your own profile picture and you can put your friends and family on this app there are also games and filters you can use witch is also very very cool üòé I use this app to call all of my friends I can call eneyone all you have to do is put there code In!Its so easy to use!You can also grow a pet by taking care of it its soooo fun I love this app!,
It's awsome! I can text my friends without getting in trouble by using microsoft teams! I would reccommend this app to everyone,
The app is really good i 100% recomend but i wish that there could be like normal call and video call because somtimes i do not like the video. Call so please is there could be like normal call aswell then i woyld give it a 5 star!,
"Its a really great way to learn and be able to message your friends too! I would totally recommend it but just to let you know, you need your parent to log in too",
Messenger kids is the best thing I've ever had in my whole entire life like you can text your friends cousins your mommy and daddy whoever you want to text is just the best I'm a fan of letting their kids because it's just the best and I love it I'm it's just the best and imma never ever delete it or get it away Buzz Austin is the beso,
BRING BACK PETS ON MY DEVICES I uset to have pets but now I don't. I don't know why but I grew it up for a few days then it disapered. Plus all of my freinds have it. So I am mad I don't get to use it anymore. Please try to bring it back on my devices. Thanks!,
"Using Messenger Kids to stay in contact with my grandkids; receiving picture updates, short messages, etc. Keeps the grandkids messages all organized in one place and easy to find. Really enjoying the app.",
I LOVE THE APP. It's amazing you can text so many people and you can video call people. So you should use this app to text and call your friends and family. This app is only for kids üòÑ,
"As a parent, I can't set this up to message with my kids as I refuse to have a Facebook account. You better start looking at adding some other options for parents to sign up.",
this is an amazing app to communicate with!you have awesome filters missions and you can video chat too!it is so amazing me and my friends love it get this right now to text in a fun safe way!,
Its full with safety i had no worries i can actually check that who is she/he talking to etc from my phone its the best app for kids or teenagers i love this app u can get bagdes in it take funny photos u can play games in it u can do drawing in it and you can also share your progress with your family and friends ‚ù§,
"Wont let me create acc, even had to make an alt acc on email and facebook and it didnt work, tried to use a different phone and it didnt work, facebook continues to be horrible.",
It was very good when I first got it had a couple glitches wouldn't let me sign back in and that's why I gave it a four-starI went to just talk and it made me pay so I think that messenger kids is definitely the way to,
"It is awesome, i love it so much i can talk to freinds and family if they are on your parents facebook or with a code. The only thing i would change are the filters or just adding new ones.",
Still very glitchy. Doesn't allow adding new contacts. If it does it's takes months for it to accept the invite.,
"It's good but, I really wish the kids were able to unfriend who they want to unfriend. Not us parents, it's annoying to just get a text out of nowhere saying, ""dad can you please unfriend Aliana?"" Its so annoying if you could please fix this it would be great.",
"Pretty good app for kids to chat to their friends. But why can kids send gifs to each other and parents but parents cannot send them to their children? Adults monitor the app, so it makes no sense. 5 stars once this is fixed",
I've uninstalled and then installed it so many times ye when i click on the app it crashes i don't known whats up with it but it needs fixed!!!,
"Messenger Kids is a GREAT app for little ones! It contains no ads, it is super kid friendly!There is many different games for your kid to play on there own or with a friend.",
"could've been cool. problem is not many devices that kids have come with much more than 16 gigabytes of internal memory and messenger kids takes up 4.5 which is not movable to the sd card. could've been cool, just not enough room.",
"It's a amazing app but I don't know if it's because I have a android but it won't let me take videos in the app I have all the access turned on and it will let me take pictures on the app but not videos, I don't know of it's happening to anyone else",
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!! I love this because it can have your kids talk to everyone who can talk to them. this app is a great way to talk to people who are not around them.this app is a really good app :),
It is very good you can call and chat with them. You can also make chats with you're friends that are friends with you're other friends. Its really awsome!,
This app is good and all but I think there should be a way so you can message your freinds by putting in your phone number I had a freind in my class give me his number on a paper and I had no way to message him or call him but overall this app is pretty good,
We love it! Great games and filters for keeping in touch with friends and family. We enjoyed it before the pandemic but we're especially grateful for it now.,
It's nice to have so your kids can connect with family and friends but it is somewhat obnoxious when you can not mute the sounds for this app.,
I think this app is awesome because my kid loves it yeah she uses it all the time and yeah she is so in touch with her friend right now because I mean because of kids messenger I think this is awesome app for kids get the ear of 10 year old and you're not allowed to have real messenger you can use this it is awesome,
How can I talk to my friends and family without this app I have a big feeling that this apple get some upgrades from whoever made this messenger kids is just for me there's so much fun things on it and I get to talk to my friends and my family how other can I communicate with my family without this app I'm so happy I had this on my phone it's just right for me this app makes me feel even better when I'm upset there's so many fun games and you could grow a pet and it's odd very I need this app,
It's a great app! With COVID my child can safely keep in contact with friends from school it's great. The kids need this great of keeping them socializing,
It is good simple fun and nice to contact my friends but i miss the filters from normal messenger and i want them to be put together and i can't play like unlimited games but overall its nice,
this app was amazing for a year then after it took over my whole tablet I tried to go into Tik tok then it went to messenger kids I tried to go into Netflix then it went to messenger kids finally I deleted it and reinstalled it again and it eventually started working but after not even a month it had that same glitch again I suggest not installing this app,
Its protected and very secure for children theres nothing to change and that's why I give it a 5 star because it's a very nice thing because kids get to have there friends and it's very good that they have codes because if they never had a code they would just have random people that they dont know,
I love the idea but the parents controls/ overviews/ searches could be more useful. It would also be nice if only the kids had to have the kids messenger but it interacted with regular messenger,
"Personally It's a dumb app don't recommend, It's literally not giving me notifications when people would text back which is frustrating.",
It is okay i really like the games I would have given it a five star but I am saying my phone froze on that app until my phone died and the off button would not even work but the reason I gave it a four is because I'm not sure if it was my phone or the app,
I don't really know but it log me out so that something I can't really say anything about but it'still a very good app but I have 2 problems 1 you can not group call and that's something I need and 2 it's not a very good app for 3 and 4 and 5 year olds because they can be messaging a very very bad person and you wouldn't know because they will not give you the ipad so that's something very bad but it's still is a very very very good app,
"I just got the new design for Messenger Kids. I was so excited for it but then I tried to change my chat bubble color and there is no option to ""Decorate your app"" like the old design. Also can u guys add the cool color effects like normal messanger on the chat bubble s?",
"I give this a 3 because I like the app it's very good, but when people call me I don't heard a ring, it doesn't show up my screen, so could you fix it.",
It's a very good app but the problem is when u are on facetime there are not many filters but the other good thing is that I get new filters so yeah.,
"So I'm an adult (unlike most of the reviews on here I'm guessing) and I just got it so I could talk with my cousins, but that isn't the point. I noticed that there's a couple frames on here that say ""My day in emojis"" with little boxes to put the emojis in, but YOU CAN'T PUT THE EMOJIS IN THE BOXES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WRITE ON THE FRAME! I don't personally care, but if there's a little kid out there that wants to do this, they might be pretty upset by that. You guys should fix that.",
"I like it, a lot, I get to talk to friends, and do stuff, like that, but the only reason it is not 5 stars, is, I wanna nickname people, so it is easier for me to understand who I am talking to, and who they are to me. Otherwise, amazing.",
It told me that my Facebook profile wasn't found despite me checking my credentials. It told me my password was incorrect and basically didn't allow me to use it. So uninstalled.,
"Its a great app. Thing is you can't delete your message. Which is kinda unfair. But overall, it's a good app. You can play games,chat and even grow your own virtual pet.",
Messenger kids Is a great app you can video call and text your friends and it's free its so amazing and I use it all the time and if you don't have a phone number like me this is a great app to text people I rate this a 10 out of 10 it's so awesome,
"Reason for rating four star is that it was hard to login and can't delete the messages.the code are very hard to remember that I got. But u have a lots of fun with my dear pet in that app. One suggestion,can you pls keep an uptadtion on it.....you should more improve on this app.....",
"I really wish there were an option to change to name of the contact names for kids to names such as 'dad', 'grandma', 'aunt' to make it a bit easier for them fo quickly navigate.",
Fun and easy to use. My 7 year old son was able to video chat with his cousin for hours over Wi-Fi. They played the games on the app also and sent each other funny photos and stickers.,
"Its very silly and creative. and when covid came around the corner, it was there for me! And when you meet a new friend at the park, pool, school, or maybe just the store, messenger kids can help you stay in contact! I met someone and we are now friends or messenger kids!",
I keep getting a login error when trying to log my daughter into the app. It just keeps looping and won't let me log her into any device. Please fix ASAP.,
"My kids love this app. The obly thing is, I wish they had more things up on this app to have fun with like options as in filters so the kids can play with, like they have on the adult Messenger.",
"No ads at all. This is the best app for kids to video chat and message each other! And if there is a problem, you can report the problem to the owner! Best messenger app ever.",
"I wanted to set up an accpunt for my daughter, however you require a facebook account. My husband and I dont have have one. There should be another way to use this app, with out having soical media.",
its a good app but it doesn't have enough parental controls its to open there should be more options for parents to shut down. this app makea it far to easy for kids to add and chat with strangers,
its really cool because you can text and video chat people that are very far away and it can be downloaded on tablets to! but i give it 4 stars because when i was video chatting my freind i hadn't seen in years it said Video off...i was so sad i couldn't see her...so can you please fix this...?,
this is ridiculous I tried setting up an account for my daughter on her phone but when I put my info it says account not found. However it works perfectly on my phone. waist of time,
I love it I can talk to all my friends and relatives! The only thing I wouldn't mind would be that you can add people who aren't friends with them in because 2 of my friends would get along great if they could text each other too.,
It installed the app twice but wouldn't start. It flashed the logo over and over until it shut itself off.,
"So far doing great!!! Love how i,parent, get to manage contacts and view images or videos being sent to and out .",
"It's a really good app. But here's the thing. EVERY TIME YOUR PHONE DIES, YOU HAVE TO LOG BACK IN. Like, just yesterday I got logged back in, and now it just logged me out again. And my phone didn't even die! This app is a jerk. Stick to Messages. Zero Stars if I could, this app is so dumb.",
I do not like the fact that as a parent the trend seems to be these days is to video chat which cannot be monitored or played back for parents. If i knew this i probably wouldn't have let my child have the app. Only reason i let her was due to covid. No tracking really at all,
"It's amazing! I really like talking to my friends and sending them pictures, gifs, emojis, drawings, and would you rather questions!",
Add where you can name people with nicknames for all devices and photo from your gallery for all devices that would put your app over the top and have good ratings for ever!!!!and please add where your chat Buble can float add stuff like the regular messager but still kids safe! That what will help kids want the app maybe you could make a kids Facebook too idk but make it like regular messager but kids safe if you do that I'll change the rating and your get 5 stars!!!,
I give 5 stars for a reazon 1.you can make groups 2.it tells you when youre friends are online threr much more BUT.... thre are some things id like FACEBOOK to add 1. you can change your ringtone and text tone 2.you can use filters on your profile pic 3.you can send links,
Its a cute app but I really really wish you could block or shut off the calling. I dont want my kids making calls whenever they want or other calling at inconvenient times.,
This app is really fun you can play games with family and friends draw pictures and make people guess what it is communicate with family and friends you haven't seen in a while this app is really cool,
Haven't talked to my friends but also really bad way because my friend was being really rude to me and don't like that you I was like a little recording thing something I don't really like but besides that the game really really good,
Love it I can talk to my friends name Shay and we're best friends it's so fun to talk with her and chat even get more closer so we don't have to go on our mom's phones we can just chat on her tablet or phone‚ò∫üôÇ it gets more fun you can video chat even you can send pictures of you in others and animals or anything in the whole world!!!!‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,
My friend asked me to get this and now we face chat every day. This app is amazing every kid should get this app. It is a good way to comunicate with parents or friends during the summer.üòÄüòÄ,
"Garbage. It hooked up my child's account to someone else as the parent. When I went to change it, it would send that person the link. Total garbage, I deleted the app",
This app is awesome cuz I can stay in touch with my family and friends I love it cuz I can do these cool filters and cool stickers and my friend told me about it and I was okay I'll try it out and I I thought it wasn't as good as I thought of but it's the greatest app that I have on all my tablet thank you bye,
I give it a four because i love using this app cause out of all of my friends i am the only one with a working phone. So I can talk to them on my laptop and my phone using this app cause they have tablets and love this app too.But the only problem is that i cannot get on so my bff can go on.The other problem is that when i try to text someone it says u have the wrong #.My other complaint isthat my sister cannot get on cause they say u suck on the home page.My last complaint is that i just hate,
"Messenger Kids app allows my 4year old to ""FaceTime call"" his favorite people, ""play funny faces"" AKA masks & games, & makes him feel like he's one of the big kids, all the while giving me peace of mind knowing he is safe. I control who can add him on the app to interact, as well as set time limits, what content can be shared, etc.",
I LOVE THIS APP... it is so easy and good for messaging friends but there is one flaw. My phone dosen't ring when someone texts me?!,
I am trying to set this up on my daughters tablet but it won't install. All it says is cant be installed but no reason why. Plenty of space. It downloads the full amount.,
Due in COVID19I have been able to keep in touch. The best thing ever. Remember everything has an issue I personally haven't experienced any thou.üò∑üë≠üë∏üôÖ,
it has a lot of camera games easy and fun for the kids to use highly recommended except it's also easy for the kids to block if they're too young to understand pay attention to that,
this is the best text app you can ft and add a group add alt of people and latly you can change you texting coler and shang you profile but you will have a code!!!!,
For some reason when it's daylight saving time It won't work in the morning!!!!!!!! It should be able to allow me to chat in the morning!!!!!üòûüòûüòûüòûüòû‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è I tried uninstalling it but my dad was asleep and it needed him to sign in!!!!! I thought it would just be on my account but...NO!!!!?!!!??!!?!?!!? I am really disappointed in this app please fix this or Ima have to find an other app,
"Great app, fun face filters for both chatters. Connection issues and lag are sometimes an issue.",
I love this Messengee Kid App.!!! I'm able to connect to and for as long my Grandson's and I want to. We can chat or have fun changing facial looks from what the App. gives.,
This is so awesome I love it because I can stay in contact with my parents mom or dad and I get to FaceTime I get to send lots of cool stuff I even get to draw things and send it to people I love it so much I think you should totally download it it's a totally five stars my mom even likes it!!!!!!!üòçüòçüòçüòçüòé,
"This in not for kids. Even for me, it is very hard to operate this app. Please make it easier and the kids will enjoy. It needs IT to use this app. I should be 1 click away. Why need everytime to ask to download and need to select OS? And put password? Is this suitable for kids? Better to open youtube instead.",
"The app is good I just hope that they would add a feature where you can choose one of the pictures in your gallery as a profile picture. If that already is possible, can somebody tell me how to do it?",
Why when my phone is muted I have to hear this loud obnoxious nonsense?? So loud and annoying I have turned everything on mute. Still when I the send and receive I get noise. Only app that does it,
"Wish there was a notification the top of my kids tablet or phone S7 (only sometimes), this would be helpful for her know when. Trying to contact her, that's the whole point, and her pet disappeard, that was her favorite",
This game is the best because I can talk with my friends and mommy and daddy and Grandma and Grandpa if I didn't have this game I couldn't talk with my friends for a long time and there is fun games while you're waiting for people to send you something back you could pick a question or play a drawing game or grow your pet there's a lot of fun things,
Really fun to talk to my friends . glitches some but lasts for about 3 days maximum. could use an update . Has been the same for 2 years.,
It's a good app no bugs for adds one thing I would like would be if it would show the time when message was sent. And if you 3 rd pet after growing your second,
I'd give a 5 except the app doesn't always send notifications through. I have to open the app several times just to see new messages,
Terrible! There's no option to delete messages. Kids sometimes might send stupid things and there's no option to delete that. Not the control any parent would like.,
This has been a great app for the kids through all of this madness. But it really needs a time and date stamp function like in regular messenger.,
Excellent safe app- that puts my 11 year old in contact with his family and some close friends. This is so important now with covid-19! Thank you for making this!,
I love this app! One of my daughter has it and its awesome. My little daughter has no problem keeping in contact with the rest of the family. Very easy for kids to use.,
it is so great for my kids so they can talk to their family that's is in California Florida and all that stuff so they can talk to their family friends boyfriend girlfriend whatever yeah I can talk to me wonder and camp or the dad come pick him up from school or the Boys & Girls Club but yeah listen to kids is a great controlling app for parents and your kids putting times when they can't and can play on yeah but that's what she says is fun so thank you messenger kids,
"This app is really great for kids. The only concern is that every time i press revoew data, the app crashes.",
Great app for my children to communicate with family. Really great for privacy also I love that nobody can contact them. Thank you for making such a great app!,
I would give it 5 stars but Can you make it were only the creators of the group can add people and delete people it's very annoying that people add people that aren't spose to be in the group and that they change the name to something else,
"Love the app but it has a glitch- when I try to open the app on my device (parent) it closes after inputing my password and says ""ask a grown up"". So I'm asking youüòÇ why is this happening? I can only access the parent dashboard from within my main Facebook app- and only when there is a notification from the kids messenger. Please help",
"when i try to log in, it says account not found. i've gone back to check that my email & phone number were both confirmed and correct but I'm still getting the same issue & cant get into the app",
I could not get account to set up for my child kept getting account creation failure message. Makes no sence I have a facebook account and I cannot get my child messager kids this is crazy. App does not work.,
I love this app but it would be really fun if you could share your screen like watch a movie with your friends while still on the app. watch each other play a game while still being on the appüòÄ cuz that would be really fun,
this app Rocks I can take photos with face filters and send them to my family or friends. I love the new update too!! Every time I update it it is even better.,
I rate it 3 startls because I kept calling my friend and she wasn't getting a alert she was on another call but I think you should notify them that I'm calling them and I sent messages so please alert them other than that it's good but please fix that one problem,
"Works great, but needs a few things. 1. Needs a parent lock code. So, kids can't get on yours to change settings. 2. Needs to disallow kids to use block whenever they want and groups without parent permission.",
"I enjoy this app, I did not want my son to have any social media accounts and he does not have a cellphone so this app is perfect for him to use on his iPad, he can message or call me anytime with this app and only I can approve who he talks to on it",
This app is so cool it's kind of like snapchat with the face filters the only thing in that you have to have internet to be able to text\call and you have to ask your parents to add someone to be able to talk to and their parents have to be ok with it to and the fun thing is NO adds!!!!,
I love talking to your friends and family on it and it is the best messaging app ever. But you need to get tour friends and familys code first.,
It's a amazing app i can't lie i use it for texting friends most of the time i highly recommend it you can use emoji's to and you can play games with your friends while video chating and just play games in general if your a kid and you wanna text your friends or play games this is your game :3,
Everytime I try to verify that I'm the parent to create my kids account. It states that my facebook account doesn't exist when it does. So why is it so difficult for me to not be able to make my child an account.,
"It would be very beneficial to add the ability to change their status (Online, Away, Offline, etc.)",
It's very good because of the kids can talk to their friends and family and send funny pictures of them and they can talk to adults not only kids and play games with friends and it is funny and I like these funny pictures !!!!!!,
"Its pretty good but, the big boxes around the contacts also the filters there a barely any i just dont really get it thry act like its a really cool app, and it kinda is but i just wish there were more filters and no big boxes around contacts my lil sis doesent love it",
"This app is really good, especily for kids. There are fun games that are appropriet and I play them too. It also can teach so many things. So I recamend to downlowd!",
I love the idea of being able to keep in touch with my child and all his friends. The app allows me to make text and call video which is a plus.,
"This is from my new phone my mom put the app on her phone and I played on it for a bit and I liked it so I still play on it trying to install it now on my new phone, cool app, fun features, an do love being able to talk to my family and friends! üíïüòÅüíï",
Not liking the fact that it is telling contacts that already have messenger to download messenger kids. It should just connect with their regular messenger on fb. Other than that. Seems great.,
Evil have to call like probably 20 times just tosee someone clearly because they will normally be a voice problem so like you can't hear someone or you can't see someone. And today it logged me out so I would not get this app,
"Good looking chatting and video calling app for kids and controlled by parents. Now there is a new messenger for kids now! I am so happy that there was a new app like messenger so kids can play with their own family, friends and others! Good looking for kids.",
Looks good except I'm not sure how to be myself (on my own account) to talk to my child. I get all the alerts that both my child and i send each other. I seem to send msgs that indicate i am my child.,
I think it should have more photo filters I was thinking I'm going to leave the app if they didn't add more photo filters I also think that in should be more fun and more detailed and I just think they They should just chang the app a lot and update it,
I think there should be a little more for them to do since there is no actual Facebook for kids like adding their mood or more filters Adding their stories would be great.. idk it's a good app tho,
"I could not add a friend to my kid's Messenger Kid's account. I could only add people who are friends with me in my facebook account. I use Messenger Lite and Facebook from browser, not from App. Not sure if that is the reason but this is ridiculous !",
i love this app because i get to talk to my family and friends any time i want and i love the qustion the you to record and send them to pepole i also like the video chats and the video fliters. I LOVE THE APP SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Great app. I personally use it. Very good stuff and simple but its hella glitchy. Also connection and voice break ups. However good app.,
"I like it for my son, I would like to be able to transfer it to an sd card. It takes up to much space on his tablet. I've had to uninstall it just for him to download other games. I will try it one more time...",
"Unable to create account. I have just created and facebook account so that my kid use the kid messenger. When creating the account i get an error msg "" Account creation failure try again "" I have done the on mutiple device and multiple OS. Any Suggestions?",
"Great app for the kids to keep in touch and chat with friends and family. The parents have a lot of control over who they chat with and what is shared. More games would be good, but I think it's an amazing tool for the little ones.",
This is one of the only ways i can contact my friends and is truly useful! The only reason i give it 4 stars is because it can ne limiting. Second place only to discord.,
Nice and safe app for children. I love the fact that we get to keep track of everything and see what she's doing or have control of who gets added as contacts :),
I absolutely love that Facebook has made a Kid's Messenger app that's linked into the parent's Facebook account. It's an excellent way for our children to associate with their family members that live in another state or their friends,
"It's good not gonna lie BUT when we were trying to open it back cause we resetef my daughter's phone then it just says ""account fail wrong"" we checked the INTERNET and it was good it was fast fix it.",
This app is awesome my two daughters can communicate to anyone in the family (and their friends) safely without a worry. Unlike Facebook you can search anyone up in this case your child (or children) are perfectly safe,
Thank you so much for coming up with this. I'm so happy being able to chat with my daughter! I can also screen contact requests and messages. My children can use this app anytime!!!!!üòÅüòÅüòÅ,
It is so so fun you can do lots of fun things like vido call someone apart of you family of your friends but just remember that if you are a child make shore you write nicely because there perents could check so just remember to be nice!!!!! Oküëçüëç üëçüëç‚ò∫‚ò∫,
Its awsome for kids and family and it is great to use for entertainment. You can do video messege and video answer and take pictures or video with a filter. You can also complete missons. Its awsome. Totes recomended!,
I think this app is great for kids. This app will help your children communicate. It also helps them learn in a way if they don't really know how to spell they can see others messages. Thanks!,
This is a nice app since you have to have your parents do most of the things on there it is also nice since it is made for children and it makes me feel safer since my mother is doing most of the friend requesting and friend accepting overall it is pretty safe and I have been using this for around 4 years.,
Overall it's a pretty good app I mean I give it a Solid 4 out of 10 I mean like I'm trying to call this one friend and it won't let me before it will make it to where she can even hear it it just goes like hangs up and I'd rate this les figuring this out,
Messenger kids is awesome! Its a great way to meet new people and reach your friends. I did not give it a 5 becuse i had a promblem updating the app.üòûOther than that this app os great and i totoally recomend it!‚ò∫,
"Good and safe, definitely recommend for kids. And ZERO adds, I have not had one ad ever since I've downloaded this app, and I've had for almost 3 years",
"It is really fun, there are more than just talking there is games to that come with it. You have to put in your friends code and they except, you can now talk to your BFF.",
They don't get an alert that you're calling when they are online. So many calls are unanswered because they are young children. How about adding something to the screen that alerts them that they're getting a call?,
I enjoyed it it was pretty good except where your mom or dad could view anything you sent and you can't delete your messages only they can I really didn't like that part but other than that it's kids safe and pretty nice to use,
Trying to create an account. Get all the way to the end just to receive a message telling me there was an error and to try again. I've tired several times now.,
It works great on my phone but I would like to use it on my laptop. It says it is installed and compatible with all of my devices but it won't show up. Now I can't even contact my grandson on my phone.,
"ok i love this app except the timer when you could talk ot pepole i do not like that but the rest of the app i love except the filters they change and one time they changed to one filter only and other pepole had alot i but i like that you change filters just don,t like one but i love this app!",
"At first this app was good then when i texted my friends they never got it or my mom and it says ""messenger kids has stopped"" and i was not on it do not recommend if you are looking for an app to help your kids this is not it",
"I downloaded this for my grandson. He absolutely loves it! It's easy for him to use and it's fun! I love it too. Now when he spends the night with me, he can message his mom, dad, aunts, uncles, and cousins without me worrying about him. Great job Facebook!",
Yes i give it a five star cuz my doughter can talk to her friend in cali she has a lot of fun and im happy for her and thankfull for this app i recommend it to anyoneüòÅ and i know if she starts fighting with her friend cuz somethimes they fight and i can see it from my facebook its a great app for my kiddo and for your kids- if they like itüòÇ and she dosent have to borrow my phoneüòì phew,
"Would be nice to be able to remove messages that my kids send like videos .... and to be able to remove contacts , maybe the option is there but I can't find it.",
Once I set the acc can't reset. Once it goes to Facebook it can't change to phone contact number for my kids. Though I uninstall reinstall the setup is unchangeable. Fainted,
Touch ability is still not working for the games. Needs the ability to use Bluetooth headphones with this.. still..,
I love this app for my son and he loves it as well. It's a fantastic way for him to chat with his friends outside of school and on the weekends. I love that I'm in control of everything and because I also have it on my phone I see every message. I recommend this app,
So it's pretty good but I have one problem with it. Messenger kids will not allow me to add a friend without using a code! That really upsets me that the don't know their code thing does NOTHINTG! And I have no idea what my friends SIXTEEN LETTER CODE is.,
"Was working just fine until the past 4 hours. I have uninstalled, deleted some apps to make room on daughters tablet and its still crashing as soon as I hit open.",
"It is very nice, but I wish there was an option for chat heads my parents use regular messenger and I see that they have chat heads, and I want to have chat heads. Also I see their emojis and I want to have the same emojis as messenger!and I want different options for pets I don't really like how my pet looks I want to have a different pet like maybe you could have like a horse ball or cat ball or a albino ball.",
Super safe to use app! Perfect for chatting and video calling friends with many fun games for your kids to play! Very fun to use! Would recommend for parents with little kiddos!,
I LOVE THIS APP its my 2nd favorite but there are a few problems that's why I voted a 3 star First it kicks you off call second it has a beep sound but things I like about it it's the groups and You can get out of messenger kids and play other games which I think it's unquie,
"Can't download on PC for kids to get in contact with their dad, frustrating as my kids don't have mobile devices yet. Everything they need is on their PCs, why is this not designed for actual computers as well üôÑüôÑ",
I love this app!!! If you dont see skme of your freinds and family you can text or video chat with them.Alkost every day you get a fiffrent filter fir your camera.This app is one of my favorite i would reckmend this as a app ti text your friends and family.,
"I love this app and it has worked perfectly so far, however, is there a way to get the app on my desktop? my kids don't have phones or tablets and constantly have to use my phone. Can I download the app via the windows OS?",
i was able to set up one of my kids' phone up but when i go to set up the second i get a message saying my account can't be found. It's getting annoying.,
I love this app. Its a fun app but on video chat it will show a black screen then I cant see my friends\ family and they cant see me please fix that. Other than that I totaly recomend this app for your kid(s).,
"Would love to check out the app to see if I like it for my child, but have never made it past the account creation screen. She is of age, I have put in my Facebook, but nothing seems to work. Would appreciate any help or advice.",
This is the best app ever üôå I used it starting in February to contact my friends They were so happy that I got messager kids. I have no negative thoughts of this app so yea i love this app very much.,
"The app is good and I have used it for two years now, but the facetime glitches often. Aside from this, the app is great for kids.",
"Great way for my little ones to keep in touch with family during the lockdown :D we've had it for awhile because we used to live far away from family. But, we live in the dame town now and she still uses it daily to talk to her aunts, uncles, and grandparents safely",
"I got a new Facebook account and was trying to connect my daughter's messenger with it, and it's not letting me go any further after accepting terms and conditions. This is absolutely annoying",
"it only works on Ipads... not on my android phone. will not authorize, so I cannot see what the messages say... I thought that was the whole point to downloading this app üò°",
I like the idea but I don't understand why they can use gifs and moving stickers but cannot receive them. Would love to be able to interact back with them.,
It's fun when you can use it. it kept logging me out and I had to keep getting my parent to re-sign me in. It was getting very annoying.,
its a very kind app i for one dont have a phone!this app helps me to text my friends and family and i can call them with a diffrent face how cool is that well i do have a phone but i can not call people but on this both one site!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love my life by the way i am not wayne i am izzie brigee,
I love this app i talk on it alot and just one glitch is that i cant talk to anyone on my samsung tablet the video is frozen and theres no sound i went on my phone and it worked but i love the app and recommend getting the app!,
I love it so much I can play with my friends on call but the only thing is that I wish there was more customization because I wanted to have like two colours like pink and blue but you can only choose one colour,
"I LOVE THIS APP! I can connect with all my friends and my fam to. There may be poor connection sometimes, but that happens sometimes! What do you guys think?",
"Daughter uses it to see friends/family that dont live near us. Its kid safe, she can play games and draw pictures etc with her friends and cousins. I love it.",
I have a complaint that when I try to set my kids account up it says something went wrong. And every time I try it always says that. It is so annoying. I'm gonna unstall it and never get it back.,
This app actually helps me talk to my friends and family and this is a really good app because you all you need is a Facebook account which I didn't set it up but my mom set it up and it's a really good app and I think you should really download this app because it's the best app in the world that is safe and non-violent and you have the choice to block them report them and to add people and if you don't want to download it it's fun cuz it's in my opinion anyway,
Great app easy set up. So my 8 year old daughter would always use my moms phone on her facebook to call and text me. I got her a cell phone downloaded messenger kids and set it up. Anyone she tries to add from my friends list has to be approved by me via messenger message. Such a great app ty,
"This app makes get of of it ,but it is fun to, because you go to the camera and you can play, and you can draw things for your Friends and text them.",
"Honestly, this might just be me, and because I'm older and I'm 11. You really hate this, it is so childish, like a 3 year old would use it, swear year old don't like to really text her do anything, so why would they make this app so, like, 3 of 6 year old would like it? But I hate this app, don't install it.",
It won't let me make a account for my son it's very bad I do every thing but it says failed to create account try again then I press again but it pops up with the same message then I do it over and over and over and over and over and over again,
Its a pretty great app i can chat with family that live far away its pretty amazing but the only problem is sometimes it says your app went to sleep so i cant even chat at all for weeks and i cant use other apps like regar call and text so i would apriceate it if you would take it off cause my mom gets mad if i dont call her TwT anyways thats just a sugestion,
it keeps freezing. i unistall and reinstall and it still freezes. ive been using it the past year no issues but this past month probelms .,
Hi.. This is really interesting app. But I am facing issue with profile picture. Not able to set the profile picture from my gallery.. Anyone can please help me.,
"They deleted my child's account with no warning 3 months ago and have been telling me and the other parents they did this to that it's an error and that they are working on t, but after 3 months of no fix I dont think they care much about fixing it.",
"It's amazing üòç I love t talk to my friends on it and it's so fun to do it! It has lots of cool and cute filters, the filters are sometimes like games so that's fun",
I like the app a lot. I can text my friends and family with one simple code. Everyones codes are different though. I highly recomend you get this app.,
"if i could rate this as zero i would, ive been stuck on the log in page i have tried it so many times and a months ago i was using this with my cousin and our messages wont send for no reason it be saying something error stuff",
Good Concept but HATE the default Notification Sound and CANNOT change it like regular Facebook Messenger. It scares my dogs to death!! Will uninstall until option to change sound is offered.,
"Recent issues as others are reporting. Cannot login, just keeps looping back to login screen again. Please fix!",
"This is the worst texting app ever. I tried to put my Facebook account in, and it wouldn't work! I tried to use my mom's Facebook, it still didn't work! Worst app I've ever had.",
I'm really happy with facebook messenger for kids. I can choose who my kids have contact with and they are able to stay in contact with friends so easily.,
"I love this app it's good for talking and it has a lot of fun features to keep you entertained! My only issue is that I accidentally logged out of my account, and I asked my mum to help me log in again, but the login just fails. Can you please tell me what to do? I really want my account back.",
"I love this app! I do wish that I could get it on my PC tho. Also, I do think it should have a call button to call when you don't really want to video chat. Other than that it is a great app that I would recommend.",
Oh my gosh amazing app!!!!!!!!!! I just downloaded today i only had it only an hour and i talked to one of my friends and some people did not accept my request because they dont have their phone so please make more apps its the most amazing app‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•,
Literally says account creation failure with no explanation as to why. Tried to uninstall and reinstall and nothing. Incredibly annoying.,
"Not good because I tried to login to messenger kids and it kept saying ""the user is not allowed to use the app"" when I typed the temporary password with the correct or same digits it didn't let me login even with my Facebook account",
I can't create an account why? I have done everything right. My friend showed me it and it looks fun 4 stars because it won't let me make an account. ON any device.,
Its fun typing to my friends. I had no trouble with this app. EVERYONE that reads this message and is a kid. That wants to talk to there parents when there home alone. You can also call people.,
This app Is amazing!But why I gave it a 4 star is because I think You guys can do better.My complaints are that I wish you could search up friends Because my grand child has a lot of friends.And she just scrolls and scrolls.And my other one is that group chats should be able to play games.And my last one.My grand child has messager kids.And I have just messager I think both apps should be able to go games.Other wise LOVE it,
Keeps asking to verify account. Used code and email and password and nothing is working. Tried different versions but that didn't work too. Fiiiiix please.,
"I'm gonna try again but I've tried to sign up literally 69 times, I have everything right but it won't let me sign my child up. She was so excited to be able to talk to her friends but is now unable to. Please do fix this.",
"Good to let my daughter FaceTime me when I'm at work. But it would be nice to add bitmoji to the app. For some reason she can send them to me, but I can't send mine to her?",
The new update sucks I'm not getting notifications and my phone is not even going off when someone is texting me. Please fix this idk if it is my phone or the app but fix it if you can.,
It always gives me the run around when added friends on his account. And doesn't let you remove friends. Just bocks but they are still there. Really meh kind of app,
"I think I set it up wrong. I'm sending and receiving my sons and my messages, basically talking to myself. I like it so far would love to use it.ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
Great for your kids to chat on! You can choose who your child can text and call. Your child can make groups of friends to talk to if they are friends with them. Download for your kids now. Amazing app!,
I just don't like it because we have to put in our parents phone or email and we also have to put in a code and I just don't like it and also it doesn't let me sign in even though we put the email and number and it is saying you need to wait 24 hours and I have but it didn't work sorry but it sucks I would rather use actual messenger,
Facebook how come you are not acknowledging or responding to the messenger kids login issues?? It keeps looping back to the login screen after all the correct Information is entered.,
It is such a good app but whenever I want to add a friend it's so complicated so I would just like messenger kids to put a thing and be like a yes button so it would be easier for everyone,
It's a win win app. Child gets to chat with friends safely and I have control over her account. Finding friends and family is a bit difficult thought.,
"Like everyone else is saying- its stuck in an endless ""verification"" loop. Why are they not fixing it? If they are, why are they NOT RESPONDING telling us they're working on it",
This app is rather ageist for allowing parents to view their children's messages. Many things are simply not a child's parents' business and this needs to be accepted. Often times a child needs to confide in a friend rather than a parent (particularly during quarantine when this all was the only means of communication between many children) and it's crucial for this privacy to be respected. What sinister things are you expecting your kid to be talking about with their friends??,
"it's good but I can't use some emogis and the ones I can, it changes them to a different one than the other ones it normally shows.",
So trying to work it back up again and nope it wont send messages and keeps freezing. This is insane. I guess i need to delete and remake and account,
"I've been using this app for a long time now, but for some reason I am unable to add someone I'd like to talk to even with my parent helping me. I would love if this could be fixed quickly, many people are having this issue as well.",
"ok dont get me wrong i have heard SO many good things about this app and really want to install it. I did, but it said my parent has to have a facebook account and we have to sign into the account and that is what i really do not want to happen because i dont want to give that info.That i the only thing i HATE about it so i uninstalled it. please change that thank you.",
I have tried for 6 months to set up an account. I keep getting Account creation failure. I send several messages to FB and noone replied. I posted on the forums and noone replied.,
There is some problems thats why i give 1 star 1.when i call my friend it is black screen i cant see anything 2.if i tap a game it takes a lot of time to start 3.i cant send my friend a link it blocks if i do it 4.if i take a pic when i call my friend it takes a time and it goes to my friend atoumaticly. If u please solve this problem this app will be amazing app and i give 1 star because there are 4 problem so please solve this problem,
"This app is amazing, there is no ads at all its high quality and its very awesome. There are games, and filters and many more! Download this game right now",
"Daughter sent a picture she shouldn't have, not intentionally, and while you can delete it from your child's chat the person it was sent to can still see the picture! How stupid!",
Used to love this app as it was a way for me to communicate with my daughter after school. But it has not let me log in even after entering my information many times. I now have to find a new app to help communicate with my daughter.,
"Its awesome! It just wont let me change my profile picture on my tablet, and some of my messages wont send. But other than that, its great!!",
"I love Messenger Kids! I get to talk to my cousins who live in Ohio. We also have good connection when we are on the video chats, also, we get to play fun games, overall I give this app a 5/5",
"I love this, it is great when u are a kid like me and is really fun to use with friends, there is not much to it but u can use emojis while calling some one wich is really fun!",
"It's Fantastic! Just one bug. I can't take my profile pic in selfie mode. If I want my face for my profile pic, i need someone else to take a photo of me. ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫",
I like the app one thing that bothers me so much is that I'm not able to change my profile picture from gallery I only can take a photo I don't like that at all I want to be able to change my profile picture from my gallery not take a random picture right then there,
i love it becasue i can chat with my friends and my family but the one problem it gets frozen half of the time but not all the time and i also like the mini games and the filters it is like snapchat but for kids.,
Great app! But whenever my friend calls me when we end the call her screen goes black but mine doesn't so I was wondering if u can fix that! thanks bye:),
Great app for kids. Face time a little glitchy. Love the filters. The grow your pet glitches a bit. But overall a great app for kids in quarantine.,
I really like this app but I lost my phone and on that I had messenger kids but I lost it so I got it on my tablet it would be great if you guys could add a log in that would make it awesome but for right now iam not that happy I can't log in.,
This Is The Most Best App Ever For My Child!!!! My Daughter Wants You Guys To Also Make A Kids Facebook App If Its Possible Please Do So! She Really Has Been wanting To Share Her Art With the World And I Feel Like if you made Kids Facebook That Would Make her So Happy! Also Can you make It Where Samsung 6 Can Go to Gallery and Chose a photo? If You Could Thanks! Also Please make it where Your Child Can Change The Emoji And Have Flitters On Video call from adult version messenger Thanks!!!!!!!!!‚ô°,
"So, when I first downloaded this, it says to put in facebook password, I did that, and THEN it says that this user has not allowed this app to be active, something like that or so, can you please fix that? Thank you!!!",
Cannot make accounts for either of my children ever. I've downloaded the app on my own phone as well as their tablets and am always met with an error.,
"My friend thinks it's a good app so I downloaded it and it says it needs Facebook password or account or whatever but neither my mom dad or me have Facebook so I don't know another way to get into the app if they had a different way to get into the app then I would use that but it says "" to know that there is an adult setting up this account we need your Facebook password""",
It says a problem exists and I can't create an account. However it doesn't tell me what the problem is and my son is waiting to begin messaging his friends since there is no more school this year.,
"Great app. But would be good if you could change the contacts names or add 'nicknames' like you can on normal messenger. For eg, change names to say nana, grandad, mum, dad etc",
"No communication, ignores all messages ive sent. Someone has made a fake account with my 6yr olds photo and name, put themselves as her parent!!! I'm unable to report the profile following the instructions given. This company is in no hurry to address this.",
love how my kids can talk safely with their friends and I can monitor it. great for family conversations and lots of fun with the silly faces and games to play together. great family friendly app,
Worked great for my oldest child but now app won't let me add another child or log into the app at all. It says that my account doesn't have access.,
"my daughter normally uses this app to chat with family and friends , anyways couple of days ago she told me she can't connect ,it just blinks trying to open but then it kicks me out. so plz fix this problem.",
"It will not let me create an account for my kid. Just gives me a message saying that it can't create the account. Was looking forward to using it, but I can't even get past the account creation screen!",
"I keep getting an error saying ""account creation failure"" with no further explanation, no trouble shooting. This sucks.",
Its awesome but it needs a few updates 1) changing peoples names/nicknames 2) an offline app 3) adding Gif's That's all I can think of rn sorry if there is Gif's I can't remember but if you could fix it please do thanks! Best regards from Kaylee santamore!,
I love this app but i would love if i coupd be able two do frame by frame animation in thr drawing section it would help stimulate creativtavity in children and then they could send the animation to there loved ones that would be amazing i hope u consiter this,
Hopefully this helps get the devs attention. Much like others I cannot sign into the kids messenger on a new device. Regular messenger and fb work fine but kids just keeps asking to verify/sign in again and again. Please fix asap.,
Frustrating! I am unable to authorize the device in order for my son to use the app. Submitted a report to FB. Waiting to see if it can be fixed,
Love it. Great way for my kids to stay in contact with their friends and long distant family. I can control who they talk to (for safety) and I can see everything that is said.,
"I was on the Today Show advertising this app. It's amazing. It allows parents to restrict who their children chat with, has fun face filters, and is overall safe and enjoyable.",
What's going on with the app..I've tried multiple times to log in and it automatically logs me out and won't let me in?? Was a great app but now we can't even get in,
"Unable to create an account for my child, says account creation failure or something went wrong without further detail. Very frustrating.",
(Please reply) something suspicious happend. So my friend called me but when I saw the name it said just you and thats clearly not her nam so please fix this or tell me what's going on. I also get a lot of texts that I cant pass through my friend has it to but mines more often but it's for little things like hi or stuff like that. Thank you when you reply I may give a better review,
"I like talking to my family, and when I dont have a plan or service on my phone, i can just connect to internet and talk to my family and friends like that. I realy LOVE this app.",
"Just keeps asking for adult log in over and over, many many tries with different accounts, created new kids and new parents to test different attempts on different devices. Everywhere it is the same issue, cannot log in.",
can't log in to use it. I get a message that says no Internet connection. but.... I can use all other apps and search google. disappointing for my son who wants to call his grandparents.,
Overall this is a pretty good app BUT.. I dont get the pop up notifications and I have no idea why! I've asked and other people have this problem too. Fix it please! Thanks.,
"This is a really nice kid version of messenger, I like that they can't add random people without parents approval. And I can monitor there chat and everything! But can u add a option to shut off ur active status that would be great üëç And if u do my next update and review will be another 5 stars.",
I LOVE this app you can text all of your old friends and new friends and text other people like family you can call and add people I love this app so much I will never ever delete this app I love this app so much I am so happy my mom and dad let me download this app üòÅ,
"Great idea! My son loves taking his picture as it is. Now he can do it without getting in trouble. Lol! He loves getting messages, pictures and videos most of all!!",
It's awesome for me and other kids. It's a great place to communicate with your friends on a friendly social media platform. Thank you for Messenger kids.,
I love it I like everything about it especially because can put on filters and that you can video chat. But please make it so you can someone without video chatting.,
Can't even get signed in terrible app. Get all the way through the sign in process and it says something went wrong try again.. ..over and over.,
I love this because my kids can chat with their friends and I get to see everything from their accounts. I get alerted for friend request. Simple and safe.,
"Same problem as other reviews, can't log in. I have used this app on different devices and now can not log on with my daughter's new phone. Hopefully this can be fixed asap",
So awesome!! I can connect with anybody I want and I am really happy with it and this is coming from a 9 and a half year old!! Im glad the exists! But it needs more filters please and thank you -Izzie,
"I can't even make an account for them. It tells my every time that ""Something went wrong while making creating account. Please try again."" I've tried multiple times.",
This app is difficult to use. Was trying to add a friend for my child and I can no longer add th contact. It jus disappeared...weird.,
It doesn't have any problems for me but there is one whenever someone I have added sends me a link I can't see the link and I think that should be fixed that's the only problem anyways have a good night or day:>,
So cute for kids! They can chat and send pics with approved friends! Especially great for them to keep touch with friends during the quarantine going on!,
Over all its pretty good but when I got my account set up a STRANGER was in my chats and what happens if that's your stalker it would be creepy I recommend this app but a couple downsides about it over all I really recommend It if you don't get a stranger that you can talk to.,
"This is so fun! You guys should really try this messaging app, it has games, you can take care of your own pets, And most of all you can make a group chat with your friends! You should really download this app.",
I really like it but now when I go to change my colour it says Can't Load Favourite Colour. Plz fix it. But over all I really think it's alright I would rate it 5 if I can change the colour,
My childrens messengers wont open and it wont let me make them new ones! Not happy about it bc my kids are homeschooled and that's the only want they contact with there friends...Please Fix This For Us! And than I'll give a 5 star review back bc this app was amazing til now,
"Why all of a sudden my daughter can't send videos, pictures, or a voice recording. I reinstalled the app and still having issues",
Good app but more filters would be nice and the emoji filters should be longer and they should put the emoji on you more games would be cool and by more games i mean more on the calls. Now it loged me out and i can't do anything,
It's been forever now. My mom can't log back into messenger kids for me.She typed in her Facebook account and password she even double checked! It let her use it 2 years ago but now it isn't working.,
"this is a very good app , its just its always laggy like when i tried to call my friend it says the call didnt work and she accepts and it says call failed . its bad how laggy it is , but overall its a great app!",
Messager is like the best thing ever I'm so happy it's a thing but there's a pair my friend has this thing in her settings where she can put text themes on hers but not for me also I wish there was like a back button on call so of I need to text a nother person it does not end call,
Actually this is app is really good...But whenever I want to add a friend it needs to be approved..So I don't think that's needed.I am saying this bcz when I want to add a friend and should be approved I don't get the message also. That's I am giving two stars.,
Excellent for kids to connect together. My child is connecting with his cousins and my friends' kids in different countries .. at the same time it is safe and hope it stays safe,
I love messenger kids. Its great for me to talk with my friends!(üòùI'm 9 and I'm using my moms phone üòù) Nothing wrong so far.... just that when u r on a call u can't text anyone else but the person u r talking to... plz fix that its annoying,
I can chat with all my friends during this time and it's the best thing you can do for kids and you can post things you can say hi to your friend add people you can change your picture and there's lots of games it's the best,
It will not let me authorize my child on any device. Keeps looping to sign in again. My password is correct. I deleted app and re downloaded.,
It is the best texting calling app I'm glad it got updated so where you can call with more people than just 2 now but it did stop working so I've been trying to get it to work again for the past 2 days,
Havent logged in on a while and now it's telling me I don't know my FB password which I just changed so I could access. But apparently it's still not correct for the app what is going on,
Better than Google hangouts and i can enjoy talking to my nephew in a safe and familiar space. Haven't yet explored the creative aspects for fun with him. Maybe will be updating to 5 stars soon. üòä,
I love the app so much but I cannot seem to make my child's account I entered the birthday and her first and last name but it has a bug please check it out I think it's because of my phone brand. Please fix it now,
Doesn't work. I'm unable to authorize the account no matter how I try. I deleted and re downloaded multiple times as well. Nothing will work.,
"This app has been handy. As long as my kid has our tablet on wireless, I can contact her directly when we're not together. Great for when I'm running errands and she's at home.",
I love this game but it won't play any games grow your pet it would take an hour and it's still didn't work so 2 star is is enough but if you fix it i will give it a five star and i will change my feedback ok,
"Have had nothing but problems with it after I made a new Facebook. I can not make my daughter a new account or even be added as a parent or friend to her new account after my partner made her one for me. I messaged the Kid messagenger on Facebook and got no response, I will be looking for another means of communication for my children and will be recommending to my friends they do the same.",
This app keeps loging me out and not working at all. I am disappointed I been trying for 2 days to log in and it does not work it was fine till 2 days ago.,
I gotta change this review mk. This is from a consumers side. So i dont use this app alot sence i got a phone. But I use this some times. So when it KEEPS ON TELLING ME MY APP FELL ASLEEP 5 TIMES FOR NO REASON INTERJECTING INTO MY OTHER STUFF I WANT TO THROW MY TABLET ACROSS THE ROOM! And the app isnt open! God fox this please!,
There is a weird glitch that makes my camera not show when I call. When I try to call someone it doesn't make the ring sound.,
"it is awesome and i can text my friends and cousins and if you want to take a picture of yourself you can use filters and make yourself look funny. my older brother uses it my little sister uses it, and i use it i 100 percent reccamend this app to all kids from the age of 6-15",
I wish I could disable the games as my son's tablet is used primarily for education and the games are a distraction but I need this app on his phone so I can communicate with him when he is at his father's,
"Great, until it wasn't. We're now having to reauthorize our phones to our kids tablets.. except it's not working. Please give us a bug fix update.. üôè",
It is very very difficult when an old tablet dies to delete it from that tablet and download it on a new PC for them. I am beyond frustrated.,
"It keeps logging me out and every time I sign in, after I restart the app, it logs me out and now I have to repeat the process OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!! ARRRRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! üò§üò≠üîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅüîÅ",
I used to love this app but when we moved it stopped working. It said that calling texting for me was unavailable. It's basically useless now.,
my daughter has this. and I am not friends with her dad. and she wants to add him. but we are unable to figure out how to add him so she can talk to him. without adding him ad my friend.,
I love this app but some times for the gamse it takes a long time to lood but can u guys mack in like facetime and to Customize Profiles Picture and to change the name and last name And then be more colors for your text like Neon colors and lots of cool colors light blue?,
My 2.5yr old is able to communicate with her cousins (twins age 5) via this app. Parent controls all of the features so I feel safe when she's using it. This has been a LIFESAVER DURING COVID & QUARANTINE THIS YEAR,
"I like it but the only problem is that when you move your head away with a filter on, the screen says find a face and I feel like messenger kids could be better.",
"I can talk to 1 gbabie as long as she on her mom phone, the other 2 keeps sending me the link to add chat, thought we had it figured out but still say I have to download when they send me a message so I can't talk to them, their mom set it all up and approved me and their Nana but both of us grandmas can't talk to the kids....PLEASE give better directions on how to use or fix the issues I'm very very disappointed in this app, really want to talk face time to my gbabies",
"Might be good but cant get far enough to say. As soon as i hit ""create account"" it gives me an error notice and doesnt create the account.",
"pretty good but i wish when your kid called you it was also available to use voice call too, instead of video call everytime. My phone only allows me to answer & talk to her on speakerphone",
I love it ! :) But i put 4 stars for a reason thr game bear cakes sometimes the cake gets stuck and i hate it so i have to reload the game againüôÑ. Thats all my concerns i want to have an avatar in messenger kids too like normal messenger üòÅ,
This app is terrible. My kid wants to talk to another. Parents can are Facebook friends. Can't find them in this app to add as a friend!!!!!!,
"This app is amazing but I have 1 probelem when my kid signs out of her account to go into her other account it would just say logging out when you press it so now she can't use it so can you please change it so I doesn't do that, thank you so muchüòä",
It really wonderful and safe for kids. same as adult messenger. I'm so happy to see my kids on facetime & texting. My kids & I love it. Thank you!,
"IT IS AMAZING! The one problem i had with it is that it is hard to add friends, but a THE app is a great idea! Peefect for COVID-19 at dirst i thought this app would be voring but i was wrong, BEST APP EVER",
Hi so I really like it and things you could add is making the videos you send be longer cuz one minute to me is not enough and it is nice to talk to alot of my friends even with what is going on with the world,
"I like the app but I think that there are some things that can make it better. Chat bubble, stories, and chat theme's.",
"This is so good if your friend is far away from you and then you can call,text and have fun I love this so much so I think if your looking for a app for your kid get this one I go on it all the time 5 star",
"Didn't want to take gross ""quarantine-type"" photo of myself, so I photographed a blank wall in stead. Now there seems to be no way to update the photo.",
It is a safe and fun app for kids to chat. And the fact you parents can see what you text your friends is a wonderful thing so you know your kid is in safe hands while talking to there friends and family.,
This app is really a wonderful way for kids to safely communicate with their family and kid friends. I hope they add some features like allowing gifs with parent approval and also those present and fire effects that regular messenger has.,
I give it four stars because i cant update it and there is lots of different things that i havent been able to update it for like an year and there is but other than that its fine i can talk easly and i want to update it like the colours and filters,
"I have not used it for that long but for the time I have had it I have had little problems. It pretty slow for me, especially when it is updating.",
"So far it's an okay app. My family's not big on social media. But my daughter loves talking to her friends, and I can make sure everything is her age appropriate.",
I love it so much I get to talk to my friends since the whole virus thing you know but I wish that on face time and just the pictures still had the dragon filter I enjoyed it! üòÅ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòäüôÇ,
"I like it because I can see she is having fun, I just wish some of the chats that were made at first could be deleted because they are people that I don't want her to keep in touch with those people anymore so it would be really helpful to have that already set up to delete old chats.",
"I do not like the games they never work, so Laggy and can hardly hear on call even when I have 5 bars of wifi. Other wise it is fine. But the whole sign up thing took so long I feel ‚òπüò•üò´üòéüò¨‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüòéüòü‚òπ",
Your app is not functioning all of a sudden and we have been using it for quite some time. Extremely disappointed. FIX THE APP!,
Attempting to set up this app on my daughter's device and it keeps telling me there is an issue creating her account. Doesn't work. Don't download it.,
Very poorly done can't confirm the parents email so frustrating in a time of pandemic friends not being able to see their friends . You need to fix issues take away the confirmation can't get it to work fix it,
Very good. Very safe. Very fun and easy. Just wish you could make an account for more than 1 kid (how to make a Messenger kids for 3 children when there's only 2 parents?),
I downloaded this app on just my daughters phone so she should facetime with me and daddy when she was on sleepovers. But she really loves she is able to faceT. With bff who moved and her cousins she doesn't get to see regularly! üëå,
This app is amazing there are ABSOLUTELY ZERO ADS too! I can chat with all of my friends and family!! üí¨ there are new activities every day and filters for video chat and camera!!,
I gave it a 4 star because I really like it. I really do. But I wish there was an option where you can change the ringtone. But I get it if Messenger Kids doesn't want to but I would probably be really happy if you do.,
I like this but when I update it it does not look like what my friends kids messenger looks like . So if you could make it so Samsung tablets update like I Phones that would be great. Thank you !,
"It's a good app. I just can't sign back in. I accidentally signed out. And, now I can't sign back in. The only reason I didn't give it 1, was because I like it",
"Seem to be having the same problem as most recently. Logged out and won't authorise device, taking me back to login page. Pretty frustrating!",
Messenger kids is awseome but there are a few problem when I am calling someone they sometimes d not get the call same for me it is a weird glitch.Another problem is the microphone sometimes is very laggy or is echoing.But it is a good app.,
"Not sure why everyone is having problems with this app. It works perfectly for myself and my 2 children, they get to keep up with family and friends and I get to control who they talk to and for how long. All in all I'm happy with it.",
I hate it so much. It won't let me make a group it won't let me nearly do anything but talk to friends and family. Like jeez as a app I would recommend to kids I don't have it as a list.,
This app is good and all but i think as a parent you shoudnt put a facebook password and just put a username and your done but that my opinion and it just came out so im just being honest NO OFFENSE bit i mean it is good and all i just dont like that part i rate it a 4 tho good work,
"I love this app, it has games that you can play with y ur friends, a FaceTime, you can text and add people, I really recommend this app, it's great!",
We recently moved and this app has allowed my son to keep in touch with family and friends while he creates new relationships. With covid that has been hard so messenger kids has been amazing for him.,
"It is a fantastic tool while it works but currently doesn't work for anyone, frustrated to no end til I read the other comments. Please repair it üôè",
"I love that my daughter gets to keep in touch with her friends that have moved away. I approve who she can communicate with, and I also get to decide what times she cannot use it.",
i cant even get in the ap cuz i have to do some code if i cant enter my facebook acount but i dont even have facebook! you should just type in your first and last name and pick a profile pic and boom! your in the app and can do anything. other then that its good,
AMAZING! It is amazing its probably the best messenger on earth the only problem is I cant pick my photo I have to take it I have a galaxy tab A please fix it but other than that it is amazing!,
"if you have the space for this app, it's worth the download. my little loves taking pix and this assures me that she wont be exposed to anything inappropriate. well done!",
I love this app and it's designed especially for kids that's why I like it my love it just as much it's so good when I calls people I used to have another app that was called text free I couldn't hear anyone when I was calling them so this is a huge upgrade,
"I think it good but can't they be on PC too because the only working PC is me. I don't have a phone or anything just the PC. So if the creator made Messenger Kids please make it on IOS,PC,and others too so I can chat with my mom and dad Thank You!",
You should be able to delete anything another person says from a group chat because it may be hurtful for the person who sees it. But otherwise it's a good app.,
so ive had it since i was six and im about to turn 10 now and i still love it and there is so much to do and play! like since my mom wont let me have a phone till im 10 so this is great cause me and my sister and cousin who is my age but has a phone can talk to me and i can find out about things and be able to communicate with them and my other family and they can just call me from here so we can talk its the best and now its just a thingi do i have it on all my divices now i use nothing else!,
Was working but now it doesn't. Neither end of the face chat can hear the other person. Sound goes in and out of working.,
Its really fun to play with your friends! You can build and take funny photos! It's super fun I would totally recommend this !!!!!!!!,
"Not great I wish you could permanently delete pictures your children take. You say we can manage and monitor our kids, but it's only limited. You need to improve this app and the parental controls",
"This is a fun, safe, fantastic app that allows me to play with my school age grandchildren long distance. Lots of variety!",
Could you block the photo albums for the Kids Messenger so they can only send pictures that THEY took with the app? My daughter can access all of my pictures and could potentially send them to her contacts. Not all my pictures are kid friendly.,
"This app is trash ,you can't even make your account successfully.The worst thing is that if l put my Facebook password correctly suddenly it's wrong. Messager kids needs to fix this problem.",
Very good app lots of ways to communicate. But please ameo it so you can share a screen. There are no ads which I love.,
No easy way to review the kids actions. Installed because it was supposed to be easy to see what the kids are sending. Had an incident were the a kid took the tablet into the bathroom. Took two days for FB to provide the video and there is no way to remove the video.,
why does this app turn all my pictures that I took myself? like it turns to the left and when I try a Google image it doesn't? may just be a small bug but still. fix it please,
"Shocking, trying to set up for my Daughter but it just constantly asks for me to authorize the account over and over. Seems alot of people are having this problem. Not good",
This app is amazing it has good updates but the one thing i dont like is that it doesn't automatically update for you but its an amazing app and i would recommend it to any one with a child under the age of 13,
"Pretty cool app. Wish the parental controls were a little better, but its secure and safe for my child to use to call family so I'm very happy with it",
Im giving 3 stars because the only thing i hate is that i cant send GIF's to my kid not even pictures.. This is our account! If you guys would fix this issue it would be a perfect app.,
I love it but when I'm on it for like 19 mins it makes me or my friend freeze and I have to hang up and I try to call them back but I don't hear from them for a while until a week plz fix this glitch,
i cant do explore on my acount i dont know whats wrong it works on my brothers acount but not mine over all it oa very fun oh i also cant press when i try to change filters to different colors or different dances u dont know if it is my phone or a lag in the app but can you please fix itü•∫,
So messenger kids is a great app I love it because you can talk to your friends but right now it's glitching it won't let us turn on our cameras but whenever we do and won't show us so you probably need to fix that well I love the sack I'm going to give it five stars,
"Good experience, but would be nice if I can add more than one kid to my profile and my kids can be friends on each other's list. Maybe you can just I haven't figured it out yet....thanks.",
"I do not like this app, when i downloaded it it kept restarting and not opening. I'm trying to sign in to chat with my friends but it wont work",
"Messanger kids is AMAZING!!!they let u make a profile from your gallery,or you camera!!!!!!!they also now let you put an emoji next to your profile!!!!!!!its so easy to call or message you friend or family!!!!!you have a code,incase anyone wants to friend you!there are alot of filters!!!and when i say alot,I MEAN ALOT!!messanger kids is amazing for ANY age!your never to old or to young to use messanger kids!ü§©ü§©it lets you send photos,gif's,or emojis!And...you can also creat group chatsüòòü§©üòò",
This app is great and so fun to use. The only thing I don't like is not having a share screen feature. Other than that I LOVE IT and I will always use this to text my friends (‚úø^‚Äø^),
"There are some bugs that need to be worked out. When you're receiving a call, it doesn't pop up, so you don't know who's calling until the call becomes a missed call. Very frustrating!",
Great but one thing.Sometimes it glitches out and won't even call my friends and gives them only 1 second to respond but maybe that is just my device other wise this is a great app and I love seeing my friends when we are so far apart,
This app won't let me login my son. I have tried All day. Tried several different devices. This is before this last update. Did the update and still won't let me log him in.,
Not letting me add people. Every time I click on someone to add it will say request sent but then say add again so then I click it again and the name disappears and they don't get added.,
"Set up is very confusing, needs to be explained to adults a little better because of set up my mother and grandmother both have set up several pages for my son trying to tag or call him!!! And there's no possible way to get Facebook to delete them....",
"i gave it three stars bc when im typing to my friends and i hit send, it says ""Unable To Send!"" And it says that for everything i say, my wifi is perfectly fine.I literally have to reinstall the app",
I love that family including myself can communicate with my daughter without having to get her a cell phone. Plus it allows me to control who she can and cannot talk to.,
"It was working until I logged out and got a new phone for my daughter and now it won't let me log back in. Please fix it. Tried messaging y'all on Facebook, but I heard nothing back.",
I would give it a five but when your doing the facebook thing and it says authorise device and you click that it takes you back to add your facebook acc and I tried everything it did not work tho is this happening to anyone else?,
I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCHHH!!! me and my friends love it too! I only have 2 friends that have it sadly- but it's still super fun! This app is great for quarantine too! Really good app!,
This cant be a facebook safe app. Entered my sign in and said invalid. Got spammed hard when I downloaded this app and so did my wife. Notifications of not safe for work stuff. Definitely from this app as it went away when Uninstalled. Do not download this for your kids.,
SUPER GOOD! The only problem is that you can only do 3 drawings a day and parents cannot do drawings. Please try to at least fix the parent can draw issue. My Code is PEEL-CITY-GREY-AREA,
It was so awesome until I had to restart my computur and now I cant even type! Please can one of the desiners or can someone who made the game fix it! PLEASE!,
The app is awesome but there are some glitches when I try to video-chat my friend after like 1 or 2 hours it just randomly hangs up when nobody presses the button developers please fix this!,
I changed the setting to allow my child to receive links but it will not allow me to send them to her. What is wrong how can I fix this issue? It's not links to Facebook it's any link I send and Gifs too !,
"It is a very good app you can use face time, it has new filters posted every day. I love it. It's better than the Facebook messenger",
"The app will not allow photos to be received! Just keeps saying ""downloading photos"". Ive tried using mobile data, mobile hotspot and home internet.",
App takes up lots of storage with messages and no clear way to remove them. As the developer stated we have a app that will take all you storage space on your device.,
"All of a sudden, can no longer log in to the app. Just keeps asking for me to authorize over and over again. Please fix asap!!",
"It is a great app, the only thing is that android users don't get the new update, please fix this, also it takes forever to send a message to someone...",
"kept getting unable to send error, so logged out. Now won't let my child login. Keeps saying login fauiler. We have had this app for 1 day! Terrible, please fix!",
got logged out of my account on accident and when i tried logging back it just kept loading. reinstalled and tried many times but it still didnt work.,
The only reason im giving this app a 3 star and not higher is becuase i dont see a way to switch the account for me i set it up on my old fb account that got hacked and wanted to switch theain parent to my new account other then that the app is amazing,
friends or parents need FB account. My kids can't even text Grandparents. Friends parents must download app. I thought I could enter phone numbers my kids could text - but no. Probably just another way FB can get more data points on you and everyone connected to you.,
AWESOME My kids love this app they can text thier sis when she is away and us when we're at work even though we may be busy we love are kids and thats what matters most. You deffenitly should try this app for your kids if they bring home phone numbers constantly,
"I am happy with the effective use of the app and the options to use it for my 11 year old daughter! It does need a few tweaks to get the 5 star from me, but I'm overall happy!",
"Won't allow me to create an account for my child. I don't know what is wrong with your app, but it's ridiculous. Can't even contact through the app. I created a Facebook solely for this. Really sad.",
It will not open on my daughters phone. It is saying there is no active account and that i have to approve it on my phone. It is all set up on my phone please help with this situation.,
"It's AMAZING! Although I can only make videos for 1 minute, I don't know why. My friends can make one for longer :(",
This app is garbage!!!!!!!!!!!! Downloaded and asks for code and everytime i put code in it says not correct!!!!!!!!!! Redownloaded twice!!!!!!! Trash,
good app but the kids dont get alerts that they have messages. only if they open the app to check the messages to they get notified that a message is waiting,
great! it is a really good app to talk to my friends and family the only bug is that it lags me out sometimes and I know that it is probably just my phone but other then my horrible waif it's greatüëç,
"The reason for the 4 star and not 5 is because Messenger Kids doesn't allow you to add people as contacts unless they have an active Facebook acct. Eg, a family member doesn't have an active Facebook acct, but they have an active Messenger acct. Despite having an active Messenger acct, they cannot be added as a contact on Messenger Kids. Hopefully this gets reviewed and the app allows people with just Messenger to be added as contacts as well, as having a Facebook account isn't for everyone.",
"I signed my daughter up and the app thinks I'm her. So when I message her I'm messaging myself. It's really annoying. Also on her IPad doesn't have me, or dad of half her friends on there but I have them on my phone.",
"How can I fix the problem of no volume on any and all in coming chats? Out going is fine. It frustrates my g'daughter every time anyone chats to her because she had to answer ""I can't hear You, I will call you back""",
Absolutely RUFUSES to accept the CORRECT password. Continues to ask for the password. It's rediculous. Is there something wrong with the app? Is it outdated or something?,
"Can't set up an account for my kid, it keeps looping and asking my login info but never logs me in so I can set it up. Super frustrating.",
Has the logging in issue been rectified as yet? We havent been able to log in for days with the same issues everyone else seems to be having!!!! Its pretty frustrating at school holiday time.,
This app is terrible. I have been trying to text with my nefew for months and still can't figure out how. it can't even find my account.,
I love this app! I mostly go on this app a lot because I get to chat with my friends! This is a great app no ads no glitches! Well for me idk about other people but still a really great app!,
Fun edicational experience my son knows how to type and he was writing and reading and able to communicate with all family members that live abroad or out of the country and city it's a great app!,
"This app is amazing, there is never lagg and it is super safe for kids! And everyone, no one can contact your kid(s) unless you and the parent(s) of that person approve",
"Great app overall, but I would like to see some things like being able to edit texts and kids can create little bits telling their friends abt themself",
I can't log in with my Facebook account it says that it is incorrect I will add more stars if it gets fixed I logged on though husband's account did not work! He has not dumped his account anyway so I used it.,
I like this thing you might think that I'm a parent but if you see on your profile there's that little girl which is me so I'm seven right now and I'm in second grade lol and I'm just rating this app I'm smarter than you think... I know all types of things üòâ‚ò∫Ô∏è I know where I'm emojis are because I just use them but anyway I give this app 10 stars if I could but really I love the filter part,
"I like the app! But there's one thing I hate some messanges I send, they take a while to send! If you fix this I will give it 5 stars!",
Great app for kids. During pandemic this became a life line for my daughter to stay interacted with friends. Like that its parent controlled and no conversations can be erased without parents doing.,
"Works well to talk to other kids but not adults. Tried to add my kids grandparents, which works, everyone can see each other but he can't talk to them. Messages dont arrive.",
I love this app. It's great but you can't send stuff freely. I wanted to send a gif to my friend but it said that my parent has to verify it first which sucks. Anyway plz get this app I totally recommend it to anyoneüòú,
I really do really love this app it's like the only like you know adult messenger except for kids and kids can do whatever they want on this take pictures have fun and just you know everybody all kids should definitely like this app and I raided this app a five-star just because I love it so much!,
It's good but when I try to talk with my friend sometimes it doesn't let me send anything and it will say 'Ur message didn't send' I still like it but that's the only reason why I took 2 stars off of it so yeah,
"I've been trying to log my daughter in to stay connected with friends after school and family members that live out of town, but after I put in her information and click authorize it says it's unable to go further. FIX THIS.",
Will not let me connect with my granddaughter. My daughter and I have been trying all morning. Account creation fails. Authorization fails. We updated app. Removed and reinstalled. Nothing helps.,
It won't let me move further than writing my kids name. He was so thrilled I allowed him to get it. It's quite sad as it wasn't available in my country until recently. It says failure something and I don't get why. It recognises my Facebook account. Disappointed....,
Have been having the same problem most people have. Try to log in but keep on getting the loop which doesn't allow me to login to authorize.,
It is perfect for us kids when we wanna talk to our friend's/family and you can put filters on your pictures ask friends questions and play game I absolutely love this app you can call text and what I mean by call I mean video call‚ú®‚ú®‚ò∫Ô∏è,
"The app is great but i have one issue. Whenever i go to another app or tap on my phone, it goes black. Please fix this issue, thanks",
"It was accidentally uninstalled, so i installed again, but now when i try to put in my login info, it continues with ""logging out"" then back to the ""get started"" page. Ive tried everything, i cant authorize my device.",
Fun and interactive app for kids. Safe since there's privacy settings that the parents control. Great for long distance visits and social distancing. My son can interact with my friends kids.,
I can create one messenger kids account for one kid. But on both my device and my kids device I try to make a second one but at the end it just says account creation failure with nothing else no matter what I try.,
Messenger is a great experience. Only problem I cannot add my sons grandmother (my mom) to his account. She is my friend but won't show. Down to 3 stars. Needs a slight fix,
"I love the app, I use it all the time but when I'm on a call I can't do the dog race because I can't tap the screen even on my new tablet so that's why it is 4 stars",
I love this because i can connect with friends and family. I 100 % recomend. I had 1 issue with the games though. It would not load. But i still like the appüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,
"I like how I can pick everyone she can talk to, I get the same messages and can see any images sent to or from. It's a good start for a 10yr old girl going on 17 already!!",
"This app is great for my children who are 9 and 5. They can connect with friends and family members when they want and play games as well. I like being able to see the messages, and who they have talked to each week. Pretty cool app.",
"Great way to stay in contact with people, but you have to stay in the app to see any notifications üòû I don't like not being able to see chat messages unless I'm in the app",
"I would appreciate if the developer allowed to move the app to SD card. Our device space is not infinite. Had to remove, too bad.",
"It was kind of hard to use on phone, iPad was pretty good though, the only part I really disliked was how it opened when ""it went to sleep"" which was really quite annyoying",
The app was perfectly fine until I got a new tablet and when I called anyone it made this ringing noise. I tried everything to get it to stop but nothing works :/,
"Not user-friendly. Editing children accounts is an unnecessary challenge¬° Adding ppl is awkward. App should be geared towards all ages minors, not just very young children!",
"This is the greatest way to keep communicating with my great grandchildren especially with they mother because she is my granddaughter Ashley. I miss her so much. This is really wonderful and now I could keep in touch with my grand granddaughter especially with her sister and brother, most of all her mommy too. Grandma Elba love you all.",
"I am really glad this app was released, as it gives yungsters a chance to stay connected with clise family and friends and the perental control options are outstanding.",
This app isn't bad but i think it is for kids under 8 years 'cause it is so babyish Its games its theme ...... That we can't delete a messege we sent.And we can't make a normal call it should be a video call So these things make this app very babyish,
I love this app and II can go ahead and I'll call my mom call my dad even Even call my my cousin and all of my friend family family nice except my sister she doesn't have it yet Get it usually stay touched with your family and other things you can send thanks to them and you can also play with the game in the app I mean but it's so great you can go download it it'll be so fun fun buy by do you stay touched by the but Internet if you go ahead and get off the thing without like everything off the,
I love seeing my kids and talking to their friends and they're always loving this app and they're always on it like every single day wants before they go to school when they when they're off of school and I just love this up I really recommend it,
It keeps saying they can't log in my child . Have tried a few times . It is downloaded on his phone and mine . Be great to get help,
"Will not sign in and says to check internet connection. There is no internet issue with the device on any other application. This hasn't worked in many months, why have there not been any bug fixes in place by now?",
Wont let me create account for my son. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and still no luck. I have reported it as a problem and got no response from facebook,
I miss all the other filters when I am calling my friends but all together it's an amazing chat place and I still love it I just miss certain filters. (Bring back the floppy balloon person please),
"My 9 yr old uses this app, he never gets notifications that someone has messaged him. It doesn't pop-up on his screen or anything.",
This app is broken. It works for all my friends but my moms facebook account. She got banned for a while because she apparently sent something innapropriate but she didnt and now it stopped working. Please fix this so i dont have to have crappy call/text apps just to call 1 person,
"Great app has funny things to put on your face, also when you call someone you can play roblox, One thing that's not nice is that it gets glitcy. That's all!",
I think this app is really helpful for kids who just get phones and need to stay in contact with their parents. I highly recommend this app because it works and children can slowly get to messenger.,
Kind of disapointed i got this so me and my son could play games together like basket ball or pool and stuff but it doesnt allow it he cant even set a regular image as his pfp but its safe for him to be on which is very comforting and it even notifys me for everything so thats nice,
Excellent model. Safe for children. I would like to be able to send photos to my grandchildren on this app but I do understand why this option isn't available.,
I love this app because I can text my friends that have Facebook when I cant! The only down side is it dosen't alert me if someone texts me until i open the app,
I'm the parent in charge of my daughters account.. i can't send her things i want her to read. Like articles... I Am THE PARENT. NOT FACEBOOK. I SHOULD DICTATE WHAT MY CHILD SHOULD READ. i can't even send an article to her messager from her teacher during this covid-19 homeschool. I'm going to repeat this facebook. You are not the parent you should never dictate what the parent can send their child. You are impeding education... either give the parents better control or get rid of this app.,
"Doesn't work for some users, there is also virtually no support, my spouse cannot add my account and I cannot create a new account, seems this is happening with alot of people for months but no fix insight , no one gets back to you by the looks of things going off other users, still waiting for my reply",
"you can talk with all your friends, but if your playing a game it will most likely put your profile picture on the screen and say ""video turned off"" other wise it's great",
Same issue as others... Login loop that keeps making me cycle through and add login and password over and over but never goes further. FIX THIS.,
This is a great APP! Recommend! Ok so it's been about a year and the app stopped working I'm going to undoenload then down load it again then try,
This is a great app for kids and parents to talk to each other I actually have this whenever I was little so any parents mom's dad's get this for your kids if they want to text you just my opinion,
Been using this app for a long time now. But now that my kids have new devices I cannot authorize the device to log them in. It just takes me back to my Facebook page to put in my password and then nothing happens for them. Any chance someone can help?,
"I love this app so much. but something weird happend with my friend she said ""someone randomly popped up and the name was Santa Claus."" she was scared because it said ""were you a good girl?"" please fix this bug.",
"When ever i try to call like every 3 days, my android shuts off when i try calling my friends and it gets annoying because it turns all the way off then turns back on. Sooooooo annoying üò©",
"I added to app to both my daughters tablet but cant access into it on one , it keeps saying I dont have a facebook account no matter how many times I enter in my info.",
"Its so cool I have so many friends and family and you can text, call, lipsink, and make videos and edit them. It is so fun!!!!!",
"Will open to create an account but then will say error or something went wrong after the terms and privacy policy, does anyone know how to fix? I would give more stars if it would work.",
Please help! My daughter's messager app got deleted. I redownloaded it but it doesn't give me an option to log back in to her existing account. It wants me to set up a whole new account.. Is there anyway to login to her account or does a new account need to be made?,
"Its Great. Safe for kids, and if some random person texts you your parents can see who it is on their phone. Whatever your doing, your parents can see on their phone. Its very fun aswell.",
"This app is great overall for my daughter but it dose have some issues, sometimes messages won't send and sometimes the app just needs a plain update but it doesn't work but over all good app",
"I love this app and I really appreciate the security measures that are in place. I wish other social media platforms (facebook, instagram, tiktok) would follow suit to help provide kids safer access to social media. Otherwise they find ways to go around the age policy either in secracy or with parent permission, putting themselves at risk with internet safety concerns.",
I love that my kid can safely stay in contact with her friends and family without all the scary stuff that comes with being online. I have full control over who she talks to and it's easy to operate!,
"I love this app but it ends my calls all the time and I hate how you cannot save videos. If you can please fix these, ty very much!",
"Over the top big-brother like control over users, no control over consent regarding message content given to parents. My 2 daughters used this to message me and each other, however, FB takes it upon themselves to not only monitor,but delete any and ALL messages sent, regardless of parental consent(because it doesnt allow for it)of messages sent. It will then spam your inbox with messages telling you to monitor your kids messages, even if you authorised a message to be sent BETWEEN YOUR OWN KIDS.",
you should be able to type in what contacts you're looking for to add to their messenger.. and there should be more than just the quest's to do. also they should be able to edit the contacts names to fit who they are to them.,
This app has logged me out and wont let me log in even with the correct password. It keeps taking me back to the log in page. Please help,
So it's great BUT it won't let me change the color of my app and now its just boring. It lets me change it on my tablet but not on my phone its been like this for 2 or 3 months now.üòëüòä,
"my son love this app, but when I rate apps on my phone, it puts up his name and profile picture! I have lookednfor settings to change this and have found nothing!",
"HORRIBLE! Everytime I use it, it always says messeneger kids isn't responding can't do anything. It used to be good but now it is worse than rip off among us games.",
"this is the worst app because, you have to update it every seconed.even when you just did.this app stinks 100'/, to the max!this is so cringy and it is crusty, musty,dusty,and a wast of your app space.",
it is a great app over all but i cant seem to get it on my hp laptop and i have a friend who can change there profile picture with gallery i go and press to change my profile picture and the option was not there and still isent,
"I have been trying to connect with my niece through this app. I have downloaded it and every time I try sending a request to connect with her, I get the error ""something went wrong"". I have an android and my niece has an iPhone. Would that be the reason I can't connect with her?",
i love it but we wish we could have a ring tone for each person üòï and it glitches from time to time especially with pictures but other than that I love this app,
"I've had to many troubles with it since I got it. I've not been able to add people, so I've reinstalled it. But now I can't log back in with my Facebook accountüò°.",
Amazing app üëçüëçüëçüëç it's great me and my friends talk All the time and if my mom or dad we away and I wanna talk to them I just go to messenger kids ‚ò∫Ô∏è and for parents this app is connected with Facebook and you can see what your kids are talking about and what they're doing if they blocked anyone ur parents would know. But I love talking to my friends specially seen it Covid-19 but if you take the vaccine I can talk to my friends in real life ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ but great app,
"Excellent app, my 6yrs is able to connect with school friends, family and I feel it's a safe way for my child to communicate. Thank you",
"I love this app because my mom would not let me have messanger and my freinds said to get this app so I got it on my phone and I love all the features about it, messanger kids kepes putting new things and I love it!!!!!",
Overall I love the app it's just a little stupid how I never get updates but my sister have like thousands of update and I just don't like that because it makes me feel left out please fix this plus it doesn't let me watch videos that have sent recently or few months back or any of that and video chat is a little off because it glitches a lot and the when you get to the pictures on the video chat is just very confusing because it doesn't have like no face it just has a little magic wand plz fix.,
I love talking to my friends and getting to use so many funny filters I think it should be able to screen share but other than it not letting us do that I absolutely love it,
It is a very good place to get to talk to your friends and family no ads you can silence people who are texting you to much for a free app for kids to communicate with others it is AWESOME üòä,
Doesn't work. Been trying to set this up for my kid for over a week and it fails to create an account every time and makes me start over. Have tried on multiple devices.,
This app is great but it's not very good if you don't have facebook because then you cant chat with all of your friends.And sometimes there app is slow with the service.,
"Its great I use it to call my friends in qaurtine and aslo have fun, only problem is which is probably only my problem is that all my friends have this thing called `Try This` And I don't have it. I aslo don't have the games and stuff on there. Please fix this problem",
This app is fun but sometimes its annoying. When you call your friend it goes beep beep beep beep forever. And to make funny videos it deletes them before you can send,
I have to be honest I have been trying to make an acc for my daughter and it kept on saying stuff like an error has occurred I would change it to a 5 star if you could fix this,
I love this app I thing it's completely safe for children and is amazing for kids to message friends/family parents can see everything your child is messaging and what other people have messaged them so what are you waiting for get this app,
"Keeps sending me through a loop hole with my fb account info have tried several times loved the app before but this idk what else I can really do I've tried everything I could think of even tried suggestions from good nothing working, sad day!",
I recommend this app to every parent! My son can message and video/call people whenever he wants. And I can see everyone he talks to through my phone! Its 100 percent safe!,
"Please include the games with the ""emojis"" like basketball. That would make it perfect so I could play with my whole family.",
Its really good but the only problem i. Have with it thats well go on a call the go to a different app to play on but then it randomly will hang up.,
This app is so amazing cuz I can talk to my family and I like this app a lot because it is fun to message and the quality is amazing and no it is not I do not use apple I use Android so either one if you have an Android or Apple you it'll still work perfectly fine so yeah the quality is amazing!,
"i was using the app when i logged on and it said ""session expierd please log in"" ok. ill just log back in! nope. i have to uninstall the app and reinstall it! this is so annoying!! please fix this but otherwise great app.",
I love it you can interact with people and it is so mutch fun there is games and you can face time your frends and it is a good way to ceep in touch with people with cover 19 and that's why I gave it five stars and I live it,
"I LOVE the app, but there is one thing I don't like about it. My friend from Japan can't use the app. I think that Messenger kids should have an update where they allow it to be used in Japan, and other countries.",
"I can't delete it, I tried to make it because I thought I needed to so I could talk with my nephew, but I don't. I tried to delete the account I set up, but cant find the option. Needs clearer directions, like you DON'T need to make this for yourselves.",
It is a really helpfull app to have but sometimes it gets really anoying because it won't responsable or something like that but other then that it is soo really good app and I definitely reccomend it,
I'm a kid using this app and it is great for any kid who wants to talk to their friends and a good way to stay in touch you can create groups and talk with more than one person. I give this app a five star. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,
Incredible app. I'm not a kid I'm 14 but I use it to contact my cousins who are kids. One thing I like is that there is minigames you can do so the app isn't boring . Truly it's for kids. Good job,
I love this app. it gives my daughter a way to speak with her friends and family that's afar but I can control it. I just can't figure out how to change her profile picture,
My baby loves that she can video chat with me and I love that she can do it without actually being on fb :) Kids Messenger is helpful because I already use Messenger and now it's all together. I'm a happy parent!,
I HATE this app if I try to play games it will black out my screen and once it wouldnt let me hear my friend we had to end the call over and over again. Super slow,
"Made my son an account, and now won't let me make an account for my daughters. Tried everything, don't know why I'm unable to make anymore. If all my kids cant use the app, then why bother with it.",
"Easy to follow, sounds like fun. I miss my girl sumpin' awful! Now we can communicate, and in a safe environment! Yay!",
This Messageing kids game is really cool! I can call/message my cousin. I can also call my little sister that lives in Melbourne! I absolutely love it no ads üòÄ Definitely recommend üôÇ I love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è DOWNLOAD THIS GAME SO COOL!,
It won't ket me connect with my granddaughter after I installed..very frustrating and Noone willing to help ..I tried support and they only sent me a link which I already had so I had no help what so ever..very upsetting,
"Unable to install in android phones. Was able to install in iOS but having trouble approving contacts which always encounter ""An error occured.""",
This app is so good for your kids. At first it is slow but when you use it couple times it works great. And no one can hack you.,
Simple. Just wish there was more features like being able to forward post like in regular messenger and that you did not have to download when a frien invite you to connect with their kids,
Horrible app in order for your child to even be able to talk to anyone that person has to download the app.and every person has to have a code.too much extra stuff to do.,
Amazing for kids. Mine talk all day. I strongly suggest it for kids all ages. Sometimes the filters won't download üòí.,
"This is super horrible! It was amazing before, but now everytime I wanna chat it says that it cant be sent because I'm in sleep mode! (Which I'm not) please fix this glitch, it's so annoying and I cant chat to my friends;(",
I appsalutly love this app it is amazing but despite the fact that it can not be used off of Internet and because it kicked me off and said my app was asleep when it was 6 30 and it was set for 10:00 so weird but love it so awesome I recommend this so much,
Its a really good app. But sometimes theres some gliches but other than that its good but do u think u could add more filters please. But other than the glichs its a five star app to me,
"Cannot get past log in screen. Once I type my information and click log in, it then goes right back to the log in screen.",
Something went wrong creating your child's account I've gotten this all week I've installed and removed it a dozen times to try and fix this issue so one star it is.,
"For some reason I am not able to send messages it just says unable to send and my calls does not work, other family members are saying the same thing.",
"Please... Stop stop STOP pushing this app on me. I don't have kids, nor are there any kids I wish to contact on this app. Facebook is constantly telling me about this app and I'm sick and tired of it.",
Same issue as mentioned by others. constant login loop. Can't log my child in so now she can no longer speak with her friends and family. Fix your trash app facebook,
"I love messenger kids it's the best app for me and my friends, so we can contact each other. But I would love you to make a kids Facebook that would be amazing thanks!",
I would give this a five-star but for some reason when I'm trying it I'm a 11-year-old to but for some reason it says connection and I tried everything restarting it deleting it even my mom couldn't fix it,
I like this app but there seems to be no way to delete group conversations. My kid went group chat crazy and added everyone in his contact list. Remedy needed.,
"Can make messenger calls and video calls or do voice messaging with it, there is lots of stuff kids enjoy doing and your child only gets to talk to who you allow them to talk to. My kid loves it.",
But I wish that they do is they'd add the time work filter because I've been really wanting to use that but I can't and I can't get tick tock so I can't use the time warp thing,
The one major Improvement y'all can do to this is give pop-up bubbles like we have in regular messenger for adults. So when we message our kids as well as our friends it pops up. Do this and I'll give it a five-star,
Great app. Perfect for adults to monitor kids and easy for kids to use. Approve who your kids chat with and let them loose. They'll love it and so will you.,
"It looks like a nice app but I can't make a new account it would say ""account failure"" I've done it multiple times but it still won't make my account",
"I can't add other members to her app, I wish it had an emergency feature to signal help if needed. but my daughter is 3 and can use the app",
I üíñ that it tracks every move my kid makes and informs me of all he does. And that it is very kid friendly but most importantly it is like ft knox on child safety and that's the most important thing,
I like this app but here is the thing why do the kids need to confirm with Facebook that don't make sense can you fix that please some parents don't have or use it and sometimes well the parents have the night shift.,
App still doesn't allow parent to login unless using the one-time password. But at least that works now. The rest of it is broken.,
"A can call everyone on my device that i know,if you all want to download Mesenger Kids,if you did listen to the rules and have so much FUN texting to people.Please say this text is helpful,because it is really really really inportant.Thank you for reading this message.",
"This app is my favorite because first of all, I love taking selfies with my friends and family Second of all, I love calling friends and family Another reason, I love all the new filters! Lastly, I love making group chats with my friends and family!",
"Great app, If I'm lazy then I use this to talk. I love doing funny photos. I often spam XD. The only thing I wish it has was a home you can design.",
Can't access the account after the last update. Please fix it. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Still doesn't work.,
It's a really great app to keep kids connected with other kids and with parents it says great that you can improve and disapprove people you want to connect with your child,
"this app sucks. people send me messages but I cant see them. even though I already downloaded the app 5 times, I still get prompted to download the app in order to see my messages",
"Please fix this issue, I have been trying to login for weeks now. But it keeps taking me back to the login area, please fix your app:/ I really wanna text my friends",
it won't let me get past the second page that says this part is for the grown-ups. It won't find my email or number even though it is showing up in my Facebook that my son has a message.,
I can't talk to my friend these calls don't work please do something about it and if this happens to you too then you can do this as well but the rest of it is fine everything's fine but calls so yeah,
Im just going to say its AMAZING! I love it. I can text my cousin now. I can text almost my whole family. Its a amazing app. I recemend you to get it!,
"its good but it acts like every parent only has one child, because you cant make multiple profiles with the same parents Facebook account, so if a mom has two kids and signs them both in on messenger kids with her Facebook account, they will literally have the same contact like if the kids cousins try to message one of them it'll literally send a notification to both of them and when they reply, their cousin won't know who is even replying because both of them literally have the same messages.",
"I love this app and it's a great way to contact my friends, but I have a few problems. When I video call I can't play games, other than that it is a great appüòÉüòÉ",
yessjsjbdjxjxjxjjjjjjjjj has been the first to go on to win a series in a few weeks for a moment and the beast has a sqwiggle in a 66th round match that is the first to have as much art in a game as the game of thrones in a few minutes and then the other one of them and I have to do that to the club in a way to get to at leaste be in love and the rest are the only land in a country that has been a great person for a while now i realy like the perfect way of doing the work and I am not sure what,
Messages and calls I sent to my daughter rarely go through. I know it's not my connection because I can call and message everyone else and my daughter using her tablet on wifi so I know it isn't her connection.,
It doesn't show my FB contacts for parents. It won't even find it in search . The codes don't work either. Thanks,
I cant even get back in my account it was 1 in the afternoon and the app was asleep its supposed to sleep at 12 wake up at 10 but no its ASLEEP at 1 PM this app is stupidly dumb if you dont fix this my parent has even changed it and i left this review to tell you that this app needs fixed,
Great App for kiddos that aren't quite old enough for their own Facebook Profile but you want them to be able to Instant Message & Video Chat with Family and Friends in a safe and monitored environment that is a win for both Parents and Younger Kiddos. My son loves his Messenger Kids App.,
This is the best app for my children they are able to video chat their friends and family and I love how I got control of everything. And I can control how long my kids can use the app,
"I had it in my tablet, but it b r o k e. Its still fine, and really cool how you can contact your kids on the actual messenger app! Awesome, and if you want to message your kids without messenger and 13+ stuff, get messenger kids. it's FOR kids!",
It's a really good app. I love how I have control of who can talk with my child. I know what they talk about and what pictures are being shared. I recommend this app to any parent.,
i downloaded this for my daughter when it first came out. but i went to add an account for my son and everytime it wants me to log in to give permission it says my facebook account doesnt exist. ive reported it but nothing has been done.,
This made my family get really upset when we accidentally pressed switch accounts it made us unable to lg back in again coming up with an 'error it has happened to other please fix this!,
its really complicated to set up and sometimes they force the kids to do stuff on the app that they dont want to like take pictures and send it to people or to call someone.,
"My kids love the app,but it logged us out and it keeps going on a loop trying to log back in üòï.Please fix this at some point of time.My kids miss talking to their friends.",
"This app won't even launch. It used to. Now whenever I try to open it, it opens up and then closes right away. I just made her a Skype account for now.",
good for kids i love this app for my 21 year old even she used it for 7 years when she was 6 then she got bored then she smashed her phone but anyways thank you kids messenger and people that want it for your kids watch then because one minute they will be playing then the next they will be smashing their phones (this is a joke) thank you and sorry for your time but for real this app is good for kids again thank you and i'm a 10 year old with very fast fingers so this took about 10 minutes.,
awesome app I can text all my friends and family it's so cool and you can add people whenever you want if your parents say you can if you are a parent just tell your kids if you want to add someone and you can have them awesome and I give it five star,
Ok so this app is amazing i love it it is lots of fun i can talk to my sister and mom and aunts and uncles but one problem I cant make a group with my friends unless they have contacs like me and my two friends wanted to make a group chat but they werent contacts so please change that other wise its amazing ps this was a kid wrighting,
I really like this app. But I wish u didn't have to have Facebook to use it. I don't nor want Facebook. Just a safe app for my kids to have fun with their friends.,
"Love the simplivity! I just wish we could use Gifs like the kids can in messenger, parents are blocked from sending them to their kids. I would like the ability to adjust what my kid can receive such as gifs, images, web links, etc. As the parent we should not be limited to what we can send our kids!",
"Disappointed, app use to work great but since having to log in to a new device it keeps asking me to authorize device without going any further and all info is correct.",
This app has me all levels of confused. I downloaded it on my phone and on my child's divice but every time I approve of someone I'm told to download to child's divice but I did that. Several people have accepted friend request but can't find them on the app. So I'd like to say 0 stars,
I love messenger kids so much but I wish there were more games to play his little special features that there used to be games with them and now there's not overall I think it's good gaming I think everyone should have it,
I loved this app! However i got a new phone and it wont let me log in. I log in all of my details and it sent me back to the beginning. Truly disappointing. üòû,
Awesome app my girl loves it she can talk to me if something is wrong and she loves talking to her ate ca and more cuzs and family and friends I highly recommend you get the app for your kid.,
I would love to be able to use this app however when setting up an account on the last step I keep getting an ERROR message .... WHY? SO frustrating!,
"Omg!! This app is sooo good!!!! I just have to add some stuff to get in and Boom! I'm in, It's good you have REPORT and BLOCK.... It's not that helpful when the person you reported/block can chat with you in the group chat if they are mean.",
This app is amazing. But I wish I could play the games every time I tap it doesn't work and it takes to long to load. But overall I love this app.,
"It's not a bad app. I will admit to that. It's the 400 GB THAT REALLY ANNOYS ME!!!! I HATE THAT SO MUCH AND NOW I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE. ALSO, I HATE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICES, meaning the filters.",
"It's a really good app, but there's a problem that been going on with me my friend. Recently, it will not let me text and it will not let me call. PLEASE FIX",
"At first, I was skeptical about my kids using ANYTHING FB. However, I decided to test out the safetyness for myself and am pleased to say that Messenger Kids is VERY SAFE!Parents have TOTAL CONTROL of everything and most importantly- OUR KIDS FRIENDS. All friend requests MUST BE APPROVED by parents first! Now my kiddos can keep in touch with family & friends, on their own. Great job Facebook team!",
my kids always seem to have a hard time receiving and delivering calls from this app on their tablets. it is becoming a hassle. im close to deleting it,
Too difficult to navigate from parent account I've had to delete and remake my original account and cannot log in as a parent to control settings for my kids. I can only log in as a friend or contact with my kids accounts,
"Gives me an error that I can't create an account for my kids without any explanation, it's been months and nothing. Even reached out to Facebook to ask but 0 support.",
This app will not open on any android device. Gives me an authentication error. Facebook help is worthless. Nothing in the community except people with the same probelm.,
This app i soo nice and my kids can text each other and have fun chatting and all of that is nice bc i can see all texts and i think that is amazing bc if something gets sayed bad i can see and block them so i thing it is a five star app!,
"Unable to create an account. Log in as parent, authorize device. Then once it gets to create account for child it fails with all sorts of errors. The most prominent being ""Account creation failed. Something went wrong when we tried to create your child account.""",
"I downloaded this for my kid but kept on asking me to verify, couldn't get past that screen. Verified 10+ times but uninstalled due to failure.",
I absolutely love this app because I can see for a minute to minute what my children are doing period. Who they speak to on a daily as well as how often. ...I love it,
I really like this app it's helpful I can talk to my friends and family simple just get on the app press the buttons and I'm texting and calling simple! But Then there's discord... Known as the master of chat mhmm üòâ,
This app. Also is very usefull. For family members with having situational. Memory and. Medication issues. Also. Filtering out. Predatory attepts !,
I love kids messenger but I wish it would give the option for Samsung users to make it dark theme,
"Letterily i was tryna call my friends i heard them all but when i called someone else it didnt let me hear them so i suggest if that happens to you delete the app and re install it, or wait 4 days cuz it happend to me 2 times!!!",
I love it I can talk with all my friends and family and I don't think it cost anything I really like the games there are two I wish I could review higher than five stars,
I can chat and talk to my friends all the time with these amazing filters!!! I love this so much I RECOMMEND 100% it's so useful and takes up like no data,
"Fix this app please! It will not verify our device! Tried on three different devices, same error! Please fix your app so my kids can communicate with their family!",
"It is a pretty good app, I can keep track of who my child is talking to online. Gave 4 stars because I cannot send gifs to my child as a message.",
This is the best app ever I can talk to any of my friends and family but it takes a while to get to my pet so I am rating this 4 stars but the long time thing is everytime,
I love the app because i can msg one another. I can block someone that someone makes me unconfortable. I can msg funny photos and videos and also draw! Thank you for creating this app so much ‚ì£‚ìó‚ìê‚ìù‚ìö ‚ì®‚ìû‚ì§!!,
It will not let me get into my kids account now and I have tried everything but I keep getting notifications that they have messages.. but can't get in to accounts to see the messages,
"This app is great. I use it like everyday but it takes up a lot of my storage space, Its an awesome app in general but I got a notification that it logged me out.",
Every time I try to create an account it says something went wrong. I uninstalled it multiple times. It's not working fix this problem please.,
Awesome app me and my best friend talk every day without a problem it sometimes glitches but we also can have internet problems me and her play roblox and she uses the same tablet she is calling me on so you can go in another app at once anyways a terrific app I highly recommend it ü§©ü§©,
Great is just been very very glitchy and it gets annoying very quick when you're talking to your friend/ family member and you start glitching a bunch,
It is a really good app but when I started to use it more thats when it didn't connect or we couldn't see each other and couldn'here each other so other than that it is a good app.,
"It's not letting me log in, I'm stuck in the same cycle as everyone else is. Also the app malfunctions a lot. I just got a new phone too so it should work fine but it's not.",
"Loved this app for months, now all of a sudden it tells me that the licence is expired, my daughters heart is broken and I can't seem to find any tech support.",
Wow! this is an amazing app! You can text family and friends! You can grow your own pets. Create group chats you can text big emojis and a big thumbs ups and parent vision if you want! I love this app and it is free!,
"Great for communicating with friends and family. Unlimited source of kid-friendly filters, gifs, stickers, and emojis. Detailed parental controls.",
The experience was great but it doesnt work so good at time the visual quality gets dark n grainy sometimes at night n it doesnt alwAys connect i put the app on my kids tablets it wont let me add people as fast as on the regula raop connecttake off the premission part that the kids have ta send jus let the parents decide who ta let the kids connect ta when they first set up the app n after no more people can be added unless the parent do it through their phone,
"Listen, I may be a child. But this is a messenger for kids where I can actually text my besties, my mother doesn't let me use her. phone. So when I got my own tablet and download this, my life changed, this is amazing, just because I'm a child, doesn't mean you shouldn't take it from. me i know what I'm talking about child or not. You should definitely take it from me. This is the best app ever, please download now. ( ò·¥ó ò‚úø)",
I didn't have a parent log me in bc personal things and my friends can't have anything other then this. So I tired to log myself in with 2 dif acc didn't work I think it should work bc things like this. So yeah this app sucks,
Your app sucks. When I try to log in it just wont let me log in and make me do it again. The it would not let me log in even after a 100 tries. No ones gonna buy your app unless they are stupid like you,
This is a good app but one time I was using the camera filters on this app and there was a doll filter and I tried it and it was a doll face and then when I pressed the screen it shows a REALLY CREEPY doll face .üò£ Some of this app is not made for kids. üòØ,
its good to chat with friends that live far away and the parents would be able to see EVERYTHING but it is a fun way to connect with friends for sure!,
"I love this it makes my social life active, because when I didn't have it my social life was goingg down. And I was not spending time with my friends and family ‚Ä¢‚àÜ‚Ä¢ so when my parents realised my mum showed me the app and I really love it toght now! I use it to do roleplays with my friends on calls with it and yea!",
"It is fun but sometimes it glitches and it doesn""t have a lot of cute face filters ,you should update ur filters like snapchat.btw i am the daughter of this person.‚úå",
"Not happy it won't let make my child profile it just say ""something went wrong while creating your account try again""and I try several times but still don't work so will never recommend this app. üëé",
I love this but it has... something in the eyes of the cat a house at first I thought it was my house but me and my friend had the same home look in it (not sure if that makes sense) and we think maybe there are hackers but i cant delete it bc i cant talk to my friends bc they moved and covid is still here but plz help bc this could mean me and everyone who has could be getting hacked,
I get to talk to my son directly when I'm not home . It's a cool app plus he can talk to our family members. Especially my mother that he loves very much and he can see her now whenever he wants in his ipad instead of asking me to use my phone all the time lol .,
"This is a very good app, I do have so advice only have the app on ONE device. this is because your notifications will go crazy. But in all very nice app.",
"I really like that i am able to approve the friends, see their messages, see who they messaged most in the past week, and message my kid through the app.",
My kids messenger is a great app and I love it very much though there's a few problems like whenever I text someone too fast it ain't let me text them for like 5 minute's plus the connection on call is kinda bad please did this messenger kids,
I love it it's very easy to you is but there's one problem you have to go into settings to call people from time but I gave it a five-star it's really good BOM but boom it's amazing,
i love this app because when ever i need to block someone i can and there is no lag and i don't need internet for it and i recieve notifications and calls. Keep up the great effort!,
This is an awsome app because you can make a bunch of groups u can talk with friends and add as many peeps on there as long as u parents say yes take lots of photos is a thing i do it is super fun try it its awsome,
I love this app because it is a kid friendly environment but the calls are very annoying because I can't tap on the games I love this but can you please fix the tap thing,
"It's alright, but when I'm playing a game and calling with my friends the screen flickers, Please fix.",
This can be a good app to talk to ur friends. But it won't let me call them or see the text messages,
Super fun recommended,
"I love this app. I have a best friend, and we are distant friends but this app makes us feel closer than ever. RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.",
"It has logged me out and I can't get it to log back in. I have rebooted, updated and turned my phone on and off with no luck.",
The games like grow my pet and healthy habits didn't work when I had tried to play them but everything else was fine and good it's kinda like Skype but for kids!!,
Its definitely a 5 star app all my kids have it and love it üôÇ.But for some reason it won't download anymore and no more apps can be download so something is wrong with the appstore.,
The app does not work at all. Will not move past the login stage. Update: 10-5-22 The app opens it just doesn't let me add anyone,
I thought I was going crazy trying to log my child in but now that I came to read everyone's review apparently I'm not the only one having troubles. Hopefully this gets fixed soon because it is a great app!!,
I was in for a few years and now I got kicked out well I did not get kicked out I have to accounts and I wanted to go in the other one and I keep trying to sigh back in to my normal one and it would not let me. I do not recamend this app because what happened to me I do not want it to happen to anyone else But other that that is it a great app. You should get the app just don't do what I did. Good thing I have a phone and a tablet and on my tablet I still have it I just really want it on my phon,
This app is amazing i love it because its easy to call text and report people if you want üòï but i do have a few complaints its really hard too get people on your messanger kids so yea my opinon good luck!,
"This is a great app for child messaging and protection for them, they can be on a platform that can only allow who you feel is right for THEM, only 1 complaint when my child is logging into their other accounts it always logs them out?!.",
I was trying to log in on a phone (I'm on a tablet) and I was looking to see if there was a button to add my account on the phone and some how I axadently pressed log out and now I'm having trouble signing in. Can you please make it when you press sign out can you please add a ``are you shure you want to sign out`` and a button to press that uses a password or something to add it to a deffrent device?,
"During isolation this was a great way for my daughters to still be in touch with friends, but allowing us as parents to be in control of who they were friends with. Works well and my daughters found it easy to use.",
Good apps for my kids to stay in touch with their friends. Easy for parents to monitor and control who their kids can chat with. Love it for them to talk to my parents and other relatives without my phone.,
Be aware there was a hacker on the game if you hear send me a message it is the hacker and you are probably thinking you are doing this to scare people but I just wanted to tell people not to get game if you do not want to be messed with and seriosly it is not me I know he is a male and is 23 and likes to scare people I hope you can read this and make it not possible to get hacked anymore and there is a lot of gliches that make th game creepy.please fix before I delete the app.,
Fix the looping login issue. Apparently may people having this issue. So why isn't it fixed yet. Yall have plenty of money and resources to fix this.,
i rate this app a 4 because you can talk to youre freinds evenb tho you dont have a phone and there are lots of games that you can play .Something thats kinda hard is adding youre friends but either than that this app is great I recomend it,
"i've used it for while it awsome children can actually communacate and blah blah blah but the only issue is that sometimes if you or a friend are calling eachother it says ""cant chat right now"" and its annoying",
"Messenger Kids is a safe texting game for kids. I have it on my phone, my computer, my iPad and even on my mom's phone! Parents, if you are reading this, it is a Facebook Messenger type deal. Like I said, it is very dafe for all kids and since my mom has it on her phone, she can make sure everything is fine. Parents, you can also have it to make sure your kids are safe. I love this app so much and you can text your friends and have so much fun! You can also play games! You can make GC too!",
Really really love the app am 10 years old and I love it so much I can text my family and friends the only thing I don't like about it is it's kind of hard to add people overall I really love it,
It's awesome it's the best way to contact family!!!!! but maybe put in that it works without WiFi and with WiFi?,
I've been trying and trying to make a account but it keeps failing :( idk what to do but I gave this 2 stars beacuse of the issue but and this app looks fun I guess I have to delete it since it won't let me make a account,
This app is by far the best app ever it is safe for children they can't delete messages. And the app allows your kids to play games with their friends,
I think its alright. They only thing is that it needs a friends code why cant we just use names because if i have a name (fanim) and i enter it and someone else has it i could put another name. I also think the should update the call so i can screen share and the other people who use the app and rate it 1 star are quite dumb like the 11 year use a sim card my son is 6 and i want him to use no sim card because is young. And i think its decent still needs updating....,
I think this app is ok I have a little cousin and we face time every day and she don't know how to spell she is only 4 she can talk but not spell so she can speak into this thing and it leaves a recording massage and we would send them to each other so I think this app is oküòä,
Amazing. you can face time and text. You can also send pictures and there are a bunch of filters and you can send videos. It is pretty simple to get friends too. You can even text your realitivis and parents. You also can make groups. You can also play games by yourself and with friends. You also have missions and badges. You can send gifs and stickers. you can send old pictures too.,
"I'm 14 and my parents make me use this, I'm not allowed any other form of social media. üò≠ Other than that, good app for 8 year olds. Also, too difficult to add friends.",
Awesome app my daughter loves it but the filters are gone with no warning and it makes her sad. But overall it's a great app!,
I can chat to my friends and do everything like that it's just there is one problem I can not click on the eggs on one of the games on a fliter I can't pop the balloons is there any way you can fix that?,
"Everytime I try to log in it just keeps saying "" invalid password"" even though I picked the right account and the same password it just says invalid please fix it",
I rate this 5 stars but idk if it's just my type of phone my my freind has more up dates on messenger kids and idk why I dont have the same ones??? But beside that this app is wonderful I've been using it for around 2 years.,
"Yeah, horrible. This app tryna be clever. You can't uninstall. The only way to uninstall is to go to installed apps and games. Only for facebook users. Doesn't consider the parents who hecking DON't have facebook.",
I'm giving this app three star cuz I don't like when I can't talk to my friends after nine' o ' clock So can you fix that? And all so can it be possible to talk to two people and two calls?,
For parents: you can see what your children is texting there friends. And for children: there are lots of mini games and if someone says or does something inappropriate you press the X and press report,
"Works great. I haven't had any issues yet, but I love that I can add whoever I want to my kids contact lists and I can easily get ahold of them.",
"If I could i would i would rate 0, the reason is that you can't CALL when your outside the app so when your kid is having a sleepover you can't call them with thg is. It's better to use an actual phone number",
You can always message your friends and play great games,
Having to keep messenger kids on my phone in order to control their settings is an extra app. Would be simpler if we could make changes from the original messenger,
This is a great app I love it but my kid friend is getting games and she can't do it first i see a lot of people have problems that i can fix.,
I love this app just a few request 1 can we name our contacts and 2 i pressed decline on my friend request and i meant to press yes and it wont let me add her anymore so can you make it to were i can add people that i addicnetly press decline,
This app is trash it's absolutely for babies and I deleted it after mind because it's not for 10 yr Olds and it makes no sense and it's laggy! Also it's a copy of.... onstage am snap chat AND most of all what's app I am NOT happyüòß,
This app used to be great but now it won't even let me log in. I put in my password and it just brings me right back to the log in screen.,
"It keeps on saying the message ""Application is not installed"" and my child is getting fustrated and confused on why it keeps on saying that message. But other than that, its pritty good.",
This app is very good for ur kids u show try it I'm a kid and my mom has control of my messenger through her phone and I can only add ppl through my moms phone ur kids should try it and u can't only call and text ppl that have the kids messenger u can also call or text ppl that have the real messengerüòÉI like this appüòòüòò,
I have been trying to sign into kids messenger on their device's but it keeps looping and asking for the same details. I have uninstalled/reinstalled and updated app.. Help!...,
It's a great app but all of a sudden the app won't let me call other people. When I try to it just says connecting until I hang up. Please fix this,
Wont even let me create a account no matter what I do I alwase get the same message telling me that it cant create a account do to a error. Seems like a good app tho.,
"This is ridiculous, my mom or anyone else can't send photos to me and i have to keep logging in all the time..I hate this app..I absolutely HATE IT!!!",
This app was working great and recently it does not let me in after authorizing the device (again) I am in a never-ending loop.,
I mean I guess it's okay to talk to my friends but seriously every time I try to talk to my friend it breaks up every 5 minutes it is so annoying and we hate it can you please fix this,
"Love this app, got all my friends on it but I'm never able to make a group or share something with friends like game results and just has a loading screen. How do I fix this?",
"Okay so, this app is so amazing and it is super cool and all but whenever you send a message it says unable to send. Please please please please fix this",
It's pretty good I can talk to alot of people without a disturbing but one. As I send something it says unable to send sometimes and I have to eiat an hour to talk again,
My kids use this app to talk with family and friends. I just don't understand why the middle finger emoji and angry face with symbols referring to curse words emoji would be included on it. That should be fixed.,
It was working up until the last update. My child can send messages but it goes unrelieved. I sent her a message and she doesnt get it.,
Px xd I have to go out and have a few look at the house and get the rest in the morning to get the rest in and out of the office to get the rest of the work done so I'll have an update on the rest of our side and the other other things we need to sort out before Christmas as we are going to be away for the weekend and the rest of the week will be a bit of a mess at all and for the rest of the week so I won't be able to make it Px xd ÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂæàÂ•ΩÁöÑÊ∏∏Êàè,
It's so good you can text your friends and call them and when you text something the parents can see what you said. Plus you can add more friends and grow pets.,
"its good for talking to friends and family, but theres a big issue on when i try to text my sister it always says, ""Unable to send"", please fix this problem.",
We've been trying to sign my child up for days and it says Account creation failure and to please try again. Not worked once in three days. Very frustrating!,
This is so hard because i am a parent and i try to log in for my kid and it doesnt allow me so i dont have no experiences,
It is so epic i can belive i live witout tis app befor but i ave problƒómes sommes time it say ex[...] acte now wen i constumize my pictures and wen i clic into the x who is in the top and the message is here it open hour conversation and if i go back my costomize pictures ar gonne befor i send it so is really anoying but messenger kids is really helpfull for privites convesation whit my friends so install it if you did int do allredy,
I cannot get this app to install on my childs Samsung TAB A 2016 model. I get a cannot connect to internet pop up when trying to authorise my Facebook account. Frustrating.,
"I love it and it's concept, but I would love to be able to upload my child's picture with one I have already taken, rather than taking one directly and in the moment.",
"App broken for me. The login flow is a loop. I enter my password, give an auth code... It takes me back to login. This is new, didn't happen before.",
"It needs more parental controls such as when they can use it. It's ok, but for younger kids still a little too much freedom.",
I love this app!! I can text my friends and call them it is an amazing app and one thing you should add is more filters.thanks great job with the app!!!!!,
"Can't sign into kids devices, it only lets me create a new account which I don't want to do. Not user friendly for signing in. (So angry and frustrated. )",
This communication app for kids is amazing . The games the photos the pets all are amazing but the problem is that from a few days in the Video call the games are not coming pls see that,
Doesn't work half the time. Glitchy. Sleep mode goes on when you shut it off also. And doesnt fix itself to go back on,
"Have not been on this app for a while, but I will try to keep my grandchildren updated on what Gramma is up to - what they are up to, too. Love them & their Mom dearly!",
When I uninstalled the app and got it back agen it wouldn't let me sign back into an account it keeps on saying that my account wasn't successful like I just want to take with my friends let me do what I need to do stupid app,
picture is good and the stickers are fun. But I can't hear the person who I am trying to talk to and my volume is all the way up.,
Overall This Child App of Messenger Is Really Bad Tbh My Child Accidentally Logged Off There Account And Now They Can't Log Back in And Why can't they send links? that's really dumb to not allow links what's wrong with a child sending there friend a link of baby shark or smth and the chat limit oh you don't know how many group chats my child and her friend had to make because of it and why can't they delete the photos/messages they send? Maybe they sent accidentally send something personal yk.,
I love this app it is so cool and you can play games while listening to your friends. You can get many friends. You can also make groups!!,
"I can see other people but they can't see me. When I hit the video icon it says it can't open my camera right now.....I have allowed Access to my camera and all that. Please help,then I'd give 5*",
"My kid messed something up and now all my contacts have been added to the app and I can't remove them, this app needs to be fixed.",
Agreed. Having same problem as Ryan. Also same dates as well. Been trying for 2 days. No help in getting sorted . Frustrated as kids are suppose to be calling ppl when away,
Won't let me authorize my account to login to my daughter's phone. So frustrating!! It was working fine now doesn't work at all,
I love this app honestly but I am having trouble downloading it now i had this on my old phone but since I got a new one it's not downloading and i wish you where able to delete text messages,
I keep trying to set this up for my son on his tablet and it keeps telling me their is n error to try again. I try again and it keeps saying it. I can't get past the terms and agreement,
Sometimes when I call my friend we can't hear each other and when I send multiple pictures from my gallery I can't open the picture I want to it just opens the first picture,
Super bummed that this doesn't work for us. I've tried to setup for my child on different devices and no luck. Really sucks.,
"I can't get it to work, waste of time and a bother to send invites only to discover it won't allow the kids to log in on their phones, always an error",
"It's a great app but, whenever someone sends me more than one photo, it glitches and I can't even save the photos. Please fix this",
i rate it a 4 because its a really good app for kids and all but some people are saying its really glitchy for them and thats why im not giving its another star.if it wasnt glitchy then i would give it another star.,
"I have the same issue as everyone else, I keep putting in my password and it just keeps asking for it again, forever and ever. My kids are very upset about it! Please fix!!!!",
"I think there should be an option to give contacts ""nicknames"" like in regular Messenger. It would be much easier for kids to find the correct contacts if the names could be changed to ""Grandpa"" or ""Aunt _____""",
"Great app. This is why: 1. Very funny, creative, and fun filters. 2. Amazing quality. 3. Just over all a amazing app",
"This app is so good,it is very safe and a parent can see what your child is senting like pictures,messenges and you can also delete a partisapant and your child CAN NOT delete a message!",
It's a good app for my kids and they love it they love the games and talking to the family and friends on there they it a good app I can see what they are doing on the because they can't delete their text messages but it's the best app,
its good and all but Everytime I try to create a account for my kid I Dr ont want my kid using messenger yet because my child is only 11 years old so could u please add a feture for example where it says use messenger kids anyways or | or use messenger kids and add your birthdate and put your profile that way it's easier instead of letting my child see messenger my child isn't ready yet so please create a feature for this thank you.,
"There's a glitch where I am not able to send texts out of nowhere, not even images. However you can still call.",
My messages never go through to my own son. Messages and calls never pop up on his screen therefore it's useless because I can't get ahold of him when I need to.,
I like the idea. But the other massaging apps are a bit better. Still is really good! I love the doodle thing.,
This app is amazing but you will need Facebook to do it but it's a great appcyou should install it. I am a kid and my friends told me to download it so I asked my nana and she said yes so I use my nana or Pappas Facebook to enter messenger kids and by the way it's a kid face timing app!,
"This App Is Terrible. I Tried Signing Up For My child And Nothing Worked! It Said Something Went Wrong While We were creating Your Child's Account! I Reinstalled It And Tried Again But Nothing Worked. My Child Really Really Wanted This App Because She Wanted To Text and Call Her Friends. This Apps Horrible I don't Recommend This App To Anyone. So, Don't Waste Your time On This App.",
I think that my son should be able to upload a profile picture and the contact list should be formatted in a more space appropriate fashion.,
"It wont let me make account even tho all my Facebook information is correct. So i never even got into the actual app. Please fix this for me, bc it's very ignoring.",
"It's great to see I am not the only one experiening the above issues. It's been great for so many years now, now the children aren't able to use the app.",
I can't really give any stars as I can't actually log in. I enter my email and password and it loops back around to ask me for my log in details again and again and again.,
It Is So Cool And Even Better Than Any Social Medias!!!! A Perfect App To Go On If You Feel Like Taking Funny Pictures With Your Family And Freinds!!!! Totally Recomend!!!! Filters Are Amazing On This App!!!!,
this is a great app for your child to chat with there friends but they might take atvantage of it and call there friends on ot all the time or gossip about another person without anybody else knowing,
"I think ths app is great i wish they could let you send links like roblox pokemon wallpapers and all that stuff, so yea but the app is still pretty cool and there is no app like this in app store but i will still put 5 star rating!",
Listen i love this app and it helps me talk to some of my best friends but it only notifys me if i have the tab open and please im begging you add a feature where you can import pictures as your pfpüï¥,
"it keeps freezing. my kids get one message in & it freezes and kicks them out. i know its not their tablets, they are brand new. so its the app.",
Have tried multiple times to make an account and I continue to get a message saying that there was an issue creating the account but no suggestions for how to fix it.,
My 5 year old uses it to send pictures and voice messages to her family. I like that I can see what she has sent to people and manage her account. It's a great way to introduce children to social media.,
"I love this app, but the reason why I gave it a 4 star rating, is when you try to set your profile picture, some of the pictures will be flipped, or sideways.",
"Not easy to invite others, does not notify my child's device when I call half the time. But, when it does work it's a decent app.",
It's amazing coming from a kid I love this so much ‚ù§Ô∏è I can't wait to have more convocations on this app only thing I don't like is I can't pic a profile picture from my gallery I have to take it right there and then witch I don't really like,
"I hear the app is great but I can't seem to get past the ""authorize device"" screen on either tablet or phone.",
Idk but I don't have a Facebook account and I don't like Facebook,
It's a great app but if I set my child's thing to were it says that she can add friends by herself it doesn't work. I don't know if that's normal or not.,
Used to be great for video chats with my child while I am away. Now it doesn't run on her chromebook anymore. It just crashes.,
"It's been great! Especially during Covid with schooling at home and restrictions to visitors, my kids have been able to keep in touch with their friends",
"Weeks ago we were logged out of the kids messenger accounts. We have tried everything including using a VPN, password reset, different devices, apks of old versions. Kids messenger is broken ""The user is not allowed to log into this app."" Please fix this Meta.",
"This app is amazing my kids are In love with it,they can play games",
It is impossible to authorise my account and with no valid reason. It keeps circling back to the same page. This needs to be fixed asap.,
I good experience and this is really fit to her age thank you messenger kids to invented this kind of apps. Because in our years many of people older not showing and this is not good not suitable for a age of kids. I hope you invented a program a facebook for kids for them.,
It doesn't let me download it on a pc and it says its for all of our devices and it says it will be on your device soon and it never downloads.,
The perfect connection for kids during this time. If there was higher than five stars it would one hundred percent be that 10 out of five. LOVE IT.INSTALL FOR YOUR KIDS NOW.....,
"App doesn't work. As others said, you enter login info and it takes you right back to enter your login info. A giant loop of nothing",
Same complaint as others...the app won't let me log in. Takes you immediately to the sign in page after you've entered your correct log in info. Fix please!!,
"I like that this allows cousins and friends or whoever to chit chat with each other. ******However, I wish that this app had an Away button or a Sleep button or something.****** Little kids are so excited to 'call' their little friends that they don't realize they're blowing up that kid! >Please install an 'AWAY' 'BUSY' or 'SLEEP' button!<",
"Really could use some new gifs and features. Also why does it have to alert me when someone is online?, That's a bit annoying.",
Will not authorize FB account. Keeps looping through the same questions over and over. Officially giving up and finding another app.,
I give a five stars this app is really good but the only thing is I wish we could have just voice call so if we can't video then we can voice but other then that I give 5 stars,
"I would like my child to be able to use this on a laptop. Our tablets are too old , they are garbage. My kids can't have my phone. So they rarely get to use messenger kids. They play all the other games on laptop.",
"This app sucks. Waste of time we got this for my little sister in order to keep in touch with family while they are away. But it dosnt work, locks her out of the app, deletes everyone on the app, to many glitches.",
Very convient and set up the same way adults is but better for kids..Has tons of games and features specially for kids..helps the adult feel more comfortable and at ease with this messenger app,
I have used this app for about 2 years and it is awesome. I keep in touch with friends and family. And the funny filters and games are a perfect touch.,
The app is ok but I don't like that you can't delete stuff you send and the updates aren't you the same on Andriod and apple and on Android you can't be online and have video off and there's no call it's only video chat,
I give it a 5 because I love hanging out with friends and family and now I can!!and I play games with them and send all kinds of videos photos and filters!!,
This app is not that bad but I don't want to take a picture of myself. I want to get something from my gallery of pictures but it doesn't let you do that. I don't like it because it doesn't let you choose something from your gallery. You have to take a picture on the spotüò°,
"Good for messaging friends. There is lots of glitches and sometimes it lags thought. Over all though, great app!",
Not a bad set up. Easy enough for any age. I would suggest adding QR codes to share so that the linking contacts is a bit easyer.,
This is a great app. It allows kids to feel included while keeping them safe. The safety features are really good.,
I was trying to install this so i could text my kids. It would ask for an authorization code that it never sent and wouldnt allow me to resend one. Very disapointed.,
Great option for younger kids. My little one is able to chat with friends & family without having a social media page. Great idea.,
"I like it, but would really like to be able to see the chats. Haven't been able to do that. As a parent of a child with challenges, it would be helpful, even though we know all contacts.",
The mic causes problems and does not make sounds or freezes or boes not show up when you get a text or call.,
Pretty safe and fun for kids. You can't even send links! It is a very nice starter texting app.,
It will usually work but recently I have been having trouble texting my friends it won't send the messages or even show them in the bubble that show your text but thats my only problem with it,
"It's a really good app but one problem, you can't save videos, if you make it so you can save videos I'll give it 5 stars",
Seems to be a bug happening. I am unable to approve any new adults to my daughter's messenger. I've been trying to add two family members for 2 weeks and I keep getting an error message saying try again later.,
Alot of glitching when I call my freinds they get frozen then we just don't call its pretty nice otherwise but I would suggest keeping the old filters cause they were really fun!,
So basically I like the app and all but one of the big thinks I dont like is it doesn't support wireless bluetooth audio headphones wireless earbuds ect so if messenger see this please add this feature,
When I was signing up it said sign up with face back and I don't have facebook and the app is really slow and phone is fast I had to reset my phone two times to get the app working.,
"It would be great if parents could choose to allow (or not!) video calls. As well as ""snooze"" a contact for a certain amount of time.",
"I really do like messenger kids.the only thing I dont like is that if a message is sent or received, you can't see when it was done or sent like you can on regular messenger. It would be great if I knew the day and time .",
My experience with this app is that it lets you communicate with your friends and your parents can keep track of what you say. Things you say can't be deleted unless your parents delete it I would definitely recommend this for kids if you want to keep in touch with your friends,
Awesome app Perfect for kids to text there friends and I can see what they text. Adults can use it to so it is nice because they can text there family members like aunt's,
"I love this app, it makes it easier to connect with my family and friends but it is really easy to accidentally press the video chat button which really sucks",
"This app is an amazing app to have. You can call family ,friends and more. You can text and call which is nice if you have no other way to call or text and it is just a great,amazing app to have.",
I love this app! It is a perfect way for children to comunicate with friends and family! Without payment to!,
Please Fix Android Login!! This hasn't worked for quite some time. We have tried everything to get it to work.,
Good cause I get to call my friends and im kid:),
I love this app even though i would really injoy if my friends that have messenger would be able to send me videos from that but it says that it was deleted from messenger kids :( I hope this fixes soon,
It is fun cause you can talk and see your friends even if you are far away there is a little down side I mean it might be the phone I have but it glitchs a little bit down times,
My 7 year old loves this app. Its very user friendly and fun. Links right up to my account for keeping tabs and making sure she's safe!,
Its great and easy to use. I found out turning the ringtone off fixes the popping noise,
"this is the best way for 7 through 12 year old kids to communicate with friends parents, it's the best app ever! You should download this app right now if you have read this rating!",
Greqt app but now it keeps saying unable to send message. Ive uninstalled it like 2 times amd its still doing it. Can receive just cant send. Please fix!,
I would give this a lower rating if I could. The fact that this app is still not working correctly and the moderators are not giving any updates or comments as to what is being done to correct it is just beyond frustrating. THese poor kids. This was their only way of communicating on off days because we trusted this app. NOw they are stuck with no way to talk to their friends we just got hit by a hurricane and my poor daughter just wants to talk to her friends. I am beyond disgusted.,
It is a really good (and fun) messaging app (and kind of a game) for kids but sometimes when I am on another app the call just stops. So I give this app 3 stars.,
It's greatüëç my friend had it so I got it then my 6 year old nephew got it leading to some of my other friends getting it too! Even my 5 year old cousin got it but it's good for all ages would recommend!!,
I think this app is thery good for kids to use. Everything is kid friendly. And can you please make a feature that nobody can call you because my friends call me all the time every morning but it is a 100 out of 5 rating for me,
Well well I love the app when I get to call my friends. But the bad part is that sometimes I get calls from someone called just you and when I answer it's my friend why did you call me but they say I called them and I say no . But overall I love the app.,
"Hi! its a great app, though i cant talk to one person. Everyonce and a while it says unable to send when I did nothing! Please fix this.",
I love this app‚ù§ but I would love for it to have some other colors to choose from for the settings like maybe some greys blacks and white.,
"I like this concept. Signed in both my kids who have WiFi only phones- no numbers or Facebook accounts since they're too young. It says I can see and manage their accounts but I can't figure out where to do that. It prompts me to download the kids messenger, which I did, but then it says choose your account (as if I am the kid). If I do that then I am logged into their own accounts and would have to back out to log into my son's and see his. It would be nice to be able to manage their accounts though regular messenger or be able to see into their accounts without logging into each one by itself.",
"I LOVE this app!!! It's very Easy to use, and your child cannot add anyone without you knowing and he/she can stay in touch with family.",
I love this app I can talk to all my friends and family but Im having a problem I can't turn my camera off I don't have the little button on the side if you will look into helping me that would be great,
I recieve call my my kids and it never rings even says i have missed calls no notification everything is switched on even happens for them takes 20 secs to connect even on wifi poor app needs to be fixed,
It is great. I love having my kids being able to have fun talking to thier friends during covid 19. There is also very funny filters that they love,
Absolutely love this app I go on it every day.i go on call with my friends cousins and all my other family members this app is amazing and I really recommend getting it there are also no hackers or anybad people on it it's very safeüòÅüòÅ,
I love the app for my daughter!!! I just wish it was easier to delete people that she is no longer able to contact.,
"Horrible! My kids about to fly cross country and as her parent I can't add her family to account!? Thanks but no thanks. We'll stick to THE REAL MESSENGER APP, cause yours is nothing but problems.",
Keeps telling me to check internet connection everytime i try to log in. Tried several times uninstalling and reinstalling. This is the only app doing it,
Cant ma an account for my 9 year old daughter I follow the prompts and when i enter my daughters details and press authorise it says error has accused while trying to create the account. I have been trying g for days to make it. It's coming up the same thing every time,
"I wish I could send my daughter video links, because when I see cute kittens n puppies in videos on YouTube, I like to send them to her. She can't look at my videos I send. The parents should be able to send them, even if no one else can. We should be allowed",
It helps me talk to my friends and things I can get to my friends but they don't have his messages kind of hard so I'm reading it at 5:00 or out of five because I want to be like that and it's actually really good,
This app is so amazing my kid loves it and she can talk to any of her friends and me and her dad she loves it and I want her to be happy so it's so amazing that's why I rate it a five-star rating and oh my gosh there's so many cool apps and the update is so cute cuz my daughter changed all of her friends backgrounds to Pink and hearts oh my gosh and her profile picture is so cute,
Love my grandson having access to chat or call. Hate that I cannot locate a control to have the app ping me when they message or call. No sound.,
"it does not work if you try switching to see if you have other accounts i lost all contact because it ""couldn't find my account"" please fix this i need this app.",
"Love the app, easy for my kids to use. But I do have one complaint... The chat always says at the top ""so and so asked to chat with _ _ _"" Even though it's been accepted it still won't go away.",
My daughter loves this app very kid friendly takes some getting used to for her but she nailed it to the wall now she knows what she is doing and can safely talk with family amd close friends!!,
For some reason when I download kids messenger from Google play it won't let me sign in but when I download it from the galaxy store it works fine so I don't know what's wrong with Google plays version,
Great app! This is the new way to text and call my friends. Thr only reson I give it a 4 is beacuse it takes forever to load.,
I really like the app but I wish that there was an option to turn off the camera since I dont like to show my face if you could please put an option to turn off the camera when in a call,
I really like this app for my daughter to be able to talk to friends & family. Nothing can be erased. It works just like FB messenger but it's designed for kids.,
I'd give this app 5 stars if there was a way to save videos.,
"It's a good app, but it keeps saying to confirm my guardian, session expired. When I do, it says login failed try again.",
This is an amazing app which allows me to communicate with my son when I am out of town but also gives me the security and knowing that he is safe from the online negativity that can affect a young child's mind FaceTime Works amazing,
same issues from the others it keeps asking for password and it won't login even if password is right. try it on other device but still the same.. why we can't login?? any help?,
I love this it is so much easier to contact with friends that don't have a phone but I would like there to be like a car driving emoji so that you can tell people that you are traveling or in the car,
Vary fun for me because it can help me chat with my friends. And my family. Also because I can call them. And also I like having texing and calling joined in to one app.,
I really like this app for my daughter to use. The only thing she doesnt like and myself.....are the filters. My daughter complains about them all the time and wants to use my messenger instead. Honestly none on the filters are inappropriate on messenger. So why not include some or all on kids messenger also ... i would love if you would do that. Then my daughter would stay off mine and stop complaining about hers.,
"Great, gave it 4 stars because of bug in video calls where I can't hear a person even though I updated it just now. Please fix it!",
Glitchy. Constantly has errors. Won't let me add people for my child or accept requests also errors when trying to report issues. So can't even report the issues,
I love this app! It's amazing but one thing about the profile how come you can't go into your gallery and take a picture from the gallery to make that your profile,
Been trying to log in for days rather passwords keeps taking me to the authenticate someone needs to fix this issue it's obviously a huge flaw in the system doesn't even deserve a 1 star,
"The app was great, but now myself and the kids cannot type using the app (on Samsung platflorms, phones and tablets). Would be 5 stars if this is fixed!",
Thos is a great way for kids to talk to there friends and parents can see what they do. I have this app and ot is the best so rate it a 5 star.,
"Love the app, but hate that we cant upload our own photo instead of taking one. Also there is no Dark Mode. PLEASE PUT A DARK MODE! love the app!",
I LOVE THIS APP and I'm 8 years old and I can safely text all of my friends and it's free with no ads I use it all the time definitely recommended,
I love this game it is sooooo fun i love the effects and filters and the games you can play with your friends and family i love to draw funny things and be able to text and call people you should also rate it 5 OUTA 5,
I can't sign in. Keeps telling me to verify account. Same thing on multiple devices. I hope they fix it soon.,
I tried this app but it kept saying error everytime I tried to do something on it. So I erased it. It wouldn't even add my fam on there.,
i like it but i think there should be more things to do with your friends like more games. more face thing. more gifs thats all.,
I was exactly after something like this I just love this can't believe that all the control is in parents hands . Thanks a lot Facebook for making such a great app I still can't believe that I have got something which I couldn't believe I will get one day Once again thank you üôè,
"THIS APP IS A SOMETHING EVERYONE NEEDS! THIS APP IS amazing because you have filters, games and so much more this helps me every day so I can talk to people who are to far to walk to.",
It's really awesome and it's my favourite app in my life! it's got stickers and it's the best way for kids to chat all day long!!!!,
I absolutely love this app it allows my granddaughter to be able to message me every night. She also loves it because she can talk to her friends and family,
Anyone know what is going on with the App? It only opens for a few seconds then a white screen closes immediately.,
"I can't describe my experience because I can't use the app yet. Not every one wants to use or have a noseybook account. So how can I verify I'm the parent without a noseybook account? Yes I know there's some smart person wondering what noseybook is, its FACEBOOK.",
"Most of the time when I try and send a message to someone, it doesn't send and Judy says ""unable to send message"", this is very frustrating.",
AMAZING!!! Both of my kids have it and when there is drama between them I can easily just block them and unblock them. And you cant delete texts so I can always know whats up!,
"A great tool for keeping track of who is talking to your child online while giving them the freedom to keep in touch with friends and learn ""netiquette"" as well!",
It's great for video chatting with grandparents. Wish there were games like in regular messenger. He likes playing them with everyone. My baby is 2 years old.,
"if i create the account for my child, i should be able to to send her web links, pics, gifs, and attachments. the controls that i have over her account are almost pointless.",
"Its a great way to talk with people you habe not talked to in a while and want to! And you can video chat, its like....the best app on my phone!",
confusing and it won't let me let me give permission to my daughter top be friended by her mom unless I'M A FRIEND of her mom. or wont even find ber mom on the search even though we're aren't blocked (we just aren't friends) and those extra hoops to jump through make it frustrating,
"This is app is glitchy but I still use it, I wish I can send more than 1 min videos and I can give the poop emoji in there, and a update about where you can give a custome code like ALWS-SKIP-ZOOM-CLAS or SKUL-ISNT-COOL-ATAL, uhh more games and games for 8 year old and older, and idk",
My daughter is enjoying all the fun parts of messaging but it's hard to tell when someone is messaging her and not me since the apps on my phone and i also use messenger.,
I lost my account yesterday. With the same email! But when i used my email it said it wouldn't work and i used the correct password still it did not work!! Please add saving password üôÅ,
Alright I have to give it 4 stars BECAUSE I finished every mission and now there is nothing for me to do. And also calls are great but sometimes my friend doesn't hear me even when I am unmuted!,
"Doesn't work on android! All my iOS devices were able to complete the setup, but on my android device it just loop in on the login/guardian permission.",
I love this app getting to talk to close people and getting to catch up with friends. Honestly I love this app and thats my opinion and it doesent have to be yours.,
its great for kids and an amazing way for kids to contact their friends my only problem is that when i try to log in it says no internet and at the top of my screen it says full bars soooooo... idk,
Love everything about this app. Except the video calling. It splits the screen in half so you only see half of a persons face.,
If I could rate this a 0 I would. All this app is is annoying. Turns your entire device off every 2 seconds. I hate this app so much.,
When ever I'm trying to play a game or something my phone would turn off and on over and over and it's really annoying. And sometimes the messages don't come up..,
Its so cool That its so fun and not any thing can get me off of it and its so cool That you get to call humens That you no its so cool!! Like its so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü§óü§óü§óü§óüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüôÇ,
Uhggccvvvvhjiytg bbn iyghhuiiuwhz hi jdjrjfjrirjeidjsb TV 9 The show is a great time and a 3time for a few of them 3or and I can get a few of them to be a little more of a fun game and I think it's really good for the people to get a better look and get better with the show and the better 3they 3and is the way the game's 2was play played in,
When I call my besties it's fine but after a few minutes I can't hear them When I call back it's not letting me call so I have to reset my tablet and that's a problem but it's still fun,
I cannot authorize the device. I put in my Facebook login information and it keeps looping back to the same login screen!,
"When completing the last step with the Create Account button, I get an error that says something went wrong.",
I love the app but you have issues sometimes the camera doesn't work and sometimes when you call it won't do any sound our the camera doesn't work please fix thisüôÇ,
"The app is super awesome and it helps for the parents too, to make sure there kids don't make friends there parents don't know about and if you are a kid you must ask you parent or parents to add your friend in the app then chat.",
This app is really good to hang out with friends and to talk to parents and family but I wish there was an easyer way to get friends but still so your parents know.,
Only issue I've run into is when changing profile pic. The gallery option to choose a pic from there as my new pic does not show when I tap on my current image on my info page,
This app is honestly amazing the onl6 thing I don't really like is that if people send me photos I can't look at them.,
"All I can say is this app is horrible. Cant type, and keep losing groups. Don't recommend. It's sick, they never debug",
I think it's fun and safe but does not change filters very often and it should and I think it should have more games not just drawing games üòèüòè,
My daughter loves being able to keep in contact with friends and family. She can video chat Android or Apple. I love being able to control who she is connected to.,
This is frustrating as I can't add my grandchildren!! Please fix this issue especially for android phone as we all don't have Apple!! Thanks!!,
"I like that I have total control of who my child talks to, I have the app installed on a seperate device, my only let down is that I have to access said device to see who she messages, I wish I could access them straight from my phone should I need to so I don't have to bounce back and forth from devices.",
It is a good app it is good if you want your kid to be supervised but I wish you did not have to always video call I wish you could video call and a regular call,
Honestly its not bad it actually cool but the thing is that 1. You can't close you're cam 2. THE WHOLE RESON I INSTALLED THIS APP WAS TO CALL MY SISTER AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT I CANT DO 3. if thers a group chat created on actual messenger you can't enter calls call or text WHATS THE POIIINNT I suggest just getting normal messenger.,
It's very good but could you add things like messenger the adult one because I wanted to show my screen but I could not I also wanna delete massages. But it's still a very good app for kids,
"I love this app but everytime I try to make my child an account it will not let me, yet I do follow the guidelines and whatever I need to do to make my child an account but it just won't let me. please fix this, If you can.",
I am not getting any notification sounds or badges. I checked to see if the ap is allowed for those things and they are. Just doesnt workü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,
"My wife created an account for my daughter, but it will not let her add my account as a parent or friend to chat with her. But she can find everyone else. My name won't even show up. Anyone know why this may be happening?",
"I really enjoy talking and playing games on this app with my granddaughter when she is away visiting her Mom in Houma La, Great fun for young and old. Oh and sometimes we even add grandpa in on the fun as well. I highly recommend üëµüèΩü•∞",
"Well i think this app is good for kids because it has fun games and it is family friendly. I woild type more bt im lazy this is a good app for your kids, or just texting.",
Messenger kids is amazing .you have to get it. my kids are able to be safe and have fun. I see who they text and what they text. And they have so much fun .the Corona virus is here but messanger kids let them call their friends and family. JUST GET MESSANGER KIDS ITS AMAZING!!!!,
It's a great easy to use and good little of a learning experience for are young daughter to begin to obviously get into are electronic era but also get her the experience to not use and abuse the use of social media and to interact with family friends responsibly.,
I like this app because it's like good for kids to communicate on this can my kid always communicate like this and I should be one like put on my real-world message and I said no cuz this one is the right app for her to get on she has her own phone she only thinks she likes to play with Tik Tok Instagram Snapchat everything she be doing so many Tik Tok but I love this app and that's all I had to say I love it I love it I love you my other daughter is 9 that's a phone and gets on this app,
It is a good app for me for my kids to talk to there friends with out them sending bad stuff. Sence this world right now is not that great right now this app helps me very much,
Not showing any of the friends in the friend list and not able to chat though friend request has been approved. Really disappointing so far,
"This app is SO GOOD. But... one problem, when I connect a Bluetooth speaker device, I cannot use it.......",
The app has shut down and won't open or accept credentials any more. The app support also refuses to reach out to anyone to help.,
love it. a app that my young daughter can use like her older sisters but just right for her age. And any add on's i gifts approve before she can actually talk or message that person.,
"Really nice I get to see my daughters conversations you have to authorize the contacts before you get them, also my daughter said she could play mini games on there, but there weren't that many filters.",
"Like everyone else, I can't log in. Another thing- if kids send a message that is automatically deleted because it is against community standards, send a copy of that message to parents so we can see what it is to discuss why that type of thing is bad and should not be sent.",
"Cannot let me send messages when just restarted, when I play a video it declines and it won't let me access the decorating app with the turning off camrea thing when you call üòû",
"I love the app, u can talk to your friends, even if their rlly far away. This is a vary loveable and good app.",
This app is amazing absolutely fantastic i do online school so I use this app to talk to my friends i love the app is is also useful for school projects so we can talk for that i really recommend this app for kid but if it for kids why do you need Facebook password?and other stuff and yes I am a kid but you should add more stuff in the app and incase you send a wrong message you should be able to delete but the person has to agree for you to delete get this app for your kids plz i am a kid and,
This app is horrible I have not been able to view my photos and it gets super slow and shuts down.,
Cannot login to the app at all. Keeps returning you to the parent authentication screen. Very frustrating,
"this would be a good idea if it would actually work like adult messenger and you could type and search up first names of kids, because a lot of kids have Freinds at school that we don't know their parents names, but just the kid...This app is not user friendly for the parents end. Great idea, but terrible execution...If y'all don't fix this app I'm going to uninstall in mine and my son's device.",
This app is not available to every kid!! My granson who lives in Miami communicates with me with this app but I live in Puerto Rico and this app says its not available in my area!!! WHY!!!,
There is one problem when my daughter sent a pic to everyone she could not find her best friends in her contacts! She was so disappointed please fix this also please make a Facebook kids,
I love this app üòç it is so much fun and I can have it on all of my devices. I'm going to give it five stars because it's truly an amazing experience and I hope people download it and have the time of there lives.,
I really love this app i love it bcs i can chat/video call with my friends and family and ur parents can also see what u do in the app but if your not comfortable tyou can tell your parents about it and you can change the settings and app color theme its also ad free and has A LOT of ganes for i to play alone or woth friends.u can also chat with other ppl who have messenger or thos app,
"Too difficult to get started!! Offers to send a temp password, but Never SENDS!! to my email!!! Won't allow me to finish install!!",
"Often glitchy sending messages to my kids from regular Messenger. Also, why can't we send stickers & gifs from the ones built in to messenger? Those seem safer than photos, yet photos are allowed.",
"In this Isolation time, ut is a great way to chat to my grandson. Sometimes on Facetime it is hard to stay on task. I love his messages.",
Won't load. Keeps asking for password to grant permission over and over. My granddaughter sends me messages and I can't even see them or reply. Total WASTE!,
"Wish could send gifs to my kid, since she can send to me. Love parents side can see pictures sent but wish can see a bit of messages to stay safe. Like where it shows who messaging, just have a bit there.",
It took for ever to download it is can't wait to see how it works because on all of the other apps didn't work for me and it wouldn't let me do it on Instagram ether it cep on saying that my password was roung so if you know how to do it let me know bye,
"I have installed it a few times and keep trying to get the app to work to see if my son likes it however it will not open.. Screen just keeps flashing messenger logo, will not open",
this app is good because it when she talk to people you can barely ever talk to and because it's just a really good app but it glitches a lot now so you might want to watch it and updated,
This app is currently not able to be logged into. It just keeps sending me back to sign in over and over. Please fix this!,
Wow. Truly an amazing app. Imma kid and its rly easy to contact my friends that don't have the real message app. I love this app. Definitly reccomend.,
"I love the app it's amazing there's no glitching or bugs and what I love is that there are no adds so you can chat with your friends with no interruptions you should download this app I recommend it, it is the best chat app ever!",
"It's a good app for chatting but there's been problems that when I log in, It immediately logs out of my account so it makes it not possible to chat.",
Works good for kids. Two problems though: 1) chat doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. 2) notifications don't always show up,
"0 stars... your last update ruined the app its not even usable anymore, way to go Facebook. Wouldn't even let me in. Password not recognized, get your stuff together!",
I really like the idea but I have been trying to create an account for 2 weeks and it keeps saying failed to create an account. I have contacted them but no answer.,
For the most part I live this app. My kids are able to keep in touch with their friends and family which has brought them closer. My only complaint is that I have to be friends with the parents in order to approve them being friends.,
I love this app one problem my kid is complaining that she is having trouble playing the games on a call with her freind and it glitches out and then it ends the call otherwise great app!!üòä,
When I go to play a game with my friends it kicks me off the call. It is ok but fix it please and when I go to call it does not ring FIX IT ALL PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Extremely frustrating it will only allow me to install on my phone not the laptop. Makes it very awkward for my child to catch up with friends,
This app is good but I can't see who I'm talking to they can't see me but I just take them inside turn the thing they could see me and I can't see them though so I love this app so cool and even if have games for you to do this is the best to you guys having videos you could play games with another friend so coolüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä‚ò∫üòä‚ò∫üòä‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫üòåüòåüòå,
"I love the app its amazing,I just don't like how when i'm trying to video chat my friends it keeps saying connecting and will not go through.But that only happens when i'm video chating one person.Not when i'm calling the group chat.",
Amazing but everything my group call or only 2 ppl call are playing roblox with me or other things it disconnects but we never hang up on eachother unless one of us says I have to go then that's when we hang up but we have amazing internet,
I LOVE this app so much you get gifs and stickers and my mom likes that she can know what I am doing or my messages and she can add pepole to my tablet plus you can take funny photo effects and new ones come out every week put there isn't a lot of activities so if you can change that plz thAnK u,
"Theres thia error coming that the account could not be created, i done everything that seems to work for that problem but nothing (NOTHING) my child is desprate to see his friends, please fix this issue",
"No sound when recievn video call, all notifications are on. Always miss video call when not at tablet cause no sound alerting me",
"Great app for kids, and in general. If it got an update where you could screen share, that would be amazing.",
This app is amazing. Totally kid friendly. I had very fun to play with. It has games and other things that every kid would love,
My son was logged out of his app and I have been unable to log back in. I can't get past the log in page. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled and it just won't work.,
Love it some of my friends that dont have numbers I just add them and were out of school so it is really good to talk to them you can facetime and text and it is amazing hope you enjoy,
When your a kid and you wanna set up the account it doesn't work actually eat trash and make it better,
"First it was stuck in an endless log in loop for weeks. Now it says it's ""failed the find accounts"" when I enter my password.",
When my 5 yr old not home w me n able ti get wifi for her kindle then she sends pics stickers n we video chat..n she learned fast n easy hiw to use n able to see n send to other family members who live in other states.... Easy n fun n me n 5yr old daughter enjoy it. Ty,
Good app I would say like it I like it it's great for your child and also if you have a Facebook account then you need this app like for your kid if your kid wants to like talk to your friends their friends üëç,
My 8 year old daughter LOVES it! It let's me control how long she's on it. Best texting/video calling all for kids! Two thumbs up!üëçüëç,
Great way for my little ones to a way to talk to fam & friends under my watchful eye. He would like to change his ringtone as it isn't very loud,
"I love this app because I get to chat and play games with my friends but it's always glitching out when we call. And we always have good wifi but other then that, I like this app",
"What happened?? This used to be awesome, now all of a sudden we can't access it. Tried creating a new account and ""ACCOUNT CREATION FAILED"". PLEASE FIX!! We've been trying for over a month!",
This app is so much fun!!! Now even kids can talk to friends and family with this kid-friendly version of the classic Messenger. But I can't send poop emojis (üí©) or cussing emojis (ü§¨) or any SpongeBob SquarePants stickers.,
I dont like that you have to be an ADULT to sign into a KIDS app. I was doing this when my dad was asleep and my mom was at work so nobody was awake but me. I had no idea what my moms password was and I really wanted to go to school and tell my friend i could text her now because i have messenger kids now but i can't because i can sign in! That really ruined my morning. I was really tired and i just want to get that over with and sleep. I hope you can make it easier to sign in. Thanks.,
I can call people and it's very fun to do the pictures and do challenges to my friends and I dont need whats app or any other calling app because this is the most perfect one to me,
I have the app on a different tablet and this one Its ok but whenever I try to see the pet it just loads and never lets me and sometimes in calls it gets glichy but either then that it's fine,
This app is wonderful because I get to get together with my friends and family much easier during other crisis in case of an emergency I can just call one of my friends or family,
Easy to use. Good parental control & happy with the privacy because your child doesn't need their own Facebook account to use it!,
"I LOVE this game! It gives children a very fun,and SAFE messenger app. No pop ups will show, and YOU chose who your child can, and can't talk to.",
I really like the app but I can only give this a 3 because every time I get in a call 10 seconds later It stops responding.,
It kicked me out and left the redo the password and I forgot my password cuz it's my old one,
This app is very usefull for kids. My child really likes this! Its great for calling family members so this is very good! 5 stars! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,
I could not find out what was wrong with phone until I found out that kids messenger was taking SO MUCH STORAGE! You have to go to u.s. cellular and let them delete all the videos and photos!ü•∂üò±üò°,
Im so aggravated!!! My son loves to talk to his friends on here but now it wont let us login. It just takes me to the login page over and over even when i put my password in. Im so upset!! Please fix this quickly! Edit: My whole family has android. My friend came over with an apple phone and i was able to login. Still cant login on my own phones though. Please fix this! Its been two weeks!,
"This is a great app, But PLEASE STOP KICKING ME OFF! Everytime I'm in a certain spot it kicks me off. Great job guys. (That was sarcastic) #FixThisApp",
It's pretty cool. I only have 2 problems. 1 is the fact that I can't change the ring tone 2 is that it doesn't send notifications,
"My child is disappointed her version has even less filter options and no games, unlike the original. Please make them available on kid version",
Well U think it is a very good app for kids to talk and laugh with friends. The best part is your kid can't add and people they dont know or exeptexept see,
"Was working fine and now cannot get past the login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled, correct passwords and even used the one time password and will not login",
the app is amazing I just wish it had notifications and that is it. Otherwise if your looking for a safe messaging app for kids I would highly recommend this one :),
So far a good enjoyable app and so much fun for kids connecting with family and friends ‚ù§Ô∏è The updates are good and my kid enjoy it ‚ò∫Ô∏è it's getting better by time,
This app is great for kids to keep in touch and play games without contact. And parents can see their activity as well as approve any of their friends to connect with.,
Messenger kids is great but there is a problem. I can't text my friends on it because of unable to send and it only happens when I solo chat someone so please fix it.,
This is super awesome. My daughter can practice literacy and stay in touch with her family members in a fun and interactive way.,
"I would suggest showing a time stamp when the message was received. Plus when messages are replied back too, sometimes it doesnt show up, and i dont see til later",
so there alright I have to restart my phone MULTIPLE TIMES and then it says unable to upload my gallery and i'll get notifications and it takes forever to get it.,
I don't see options to turn off games and pets. I don't want my kid using this for something other than a communication app.,
This app it's great. But it would be better if they added fun backgrounds to this app so they could pretend the kids are somewhere fun or enchanting,
It's a very good app to call ur friends and text but the only problem is for me whenever I'm calling my friends my screen turns black when my finger goes near my screen I'mnot sure why.,
I personally think that messanger is a great app for kids wait h I am one and it is very safe for kids and hase great features and everything on the app is free so don't worry about that!! üåºüòãüòÅüòÄüòÑüòâüòä,
"Doesn't work. You log in, enter password, brings you back to log in.......obviously a widespread problem as many have the same problem ....so.fix it!",
Can't get past login loop. Apparently this has been an issue for a bit now and still is unresolved and no support.,
"I usually us this app I also really like it and it is üëå really good, it's just I have one problem.My problem is that you can send links to YouTube videos and stuff like that.Not a long review but yeah",
great app i have had a great time with it exect for one time i kept geting on but i would not load and crash but i restarted my device and it worked perfectly fine so i love this app and im obsessed,
This is good just add a turn off video button and make more groups allowed because when I want to make a group it will just take me to a group I already had.,
I tried logging in doing my password and it got it correct but It kept on doing a loop then my child got disappointed and we kept on trying and trying but we can't log in.,
In use this app 24/7 but for some reason I can't change my pfp to screen shots I can only use my camera because I'm trying to change my pfp to one of my gallery photos but other then that the app so awesome üß∏ü¶ãüëë,
It keeps crashing on my daughter. It won't let her type anything. Had to uninstall twice for it to work again.,
"My daughter loves the app! Now, we're stuck in a log in loop and the app is USELESS!! Numerous parents have complained about this; please fix!!",
Great that I can control who my kid has access to on chat. I feel better knowing that she cant be approached by random strangers to chat but she can still chat with other approved messenger users. Biggest criticism tho is that the video chats aren't recorded and saved. I generally trust my kiddos and don't need to check their accounts but a specific incident had me wanting access to her online convos and much of it she did on vid chat in her room... which isn't replayable to her or anyone.,
I had this app open while I was in the US and once I came to HN I had to reinstalled it and it says now IT ISN'T AVAILABLE IN MY LOCATION.... This is very unfair and discriminating.,
Cool I can always talk to my friends when I want,
Is good but if your parents or any one doesed have Facebook it's a waste of time and data but they need a account like a username and password for it to work other than that it's a good app,
Its such an AMAZING ap I can call all my friends with no problem so download this app and there's games on the app so you can have twice as much fun üëçüòúüòäüòÅso download this app and you'll have just as much fun as meüòÅ,
"I do not enjoy this app much because when I use it, I have to wait to add a person bc the parent haves to add them first and it's soooo annoying to meüò°üò†it's better to just let your child use real messenger.**I said I used it because I tried it out to see what is was like bc my sister uses it and complains about it so I wanted to see why and now I know it's kinda good but mostly bad so that's why it gets only 2 stars .",
Messenger kids is a smart way for kids to hve a conversation with each other from any part of tge world. It is an a mazing expericence. Thou you can make it better. But other than that i love REGARDS 12 girl,
i like this app but the only thing is that i dont get notifications for the app and then it's annoying because when someone text me I can't see until I go on the app and my mom can't accept my friend request,
"I like that the parents have full control over who their kids add. There are also time controls, so if your child sneaks on it they can't talk to anyone.",
Excellent! Allows me to have control over who my child has contact with so I know they're not talking to strangers and it notifies me of any changes ect.,
I accidentally loged out then it said that i had to put my email and Facebook password and at the time i didn't know my password so they tried emailing a code and it work as so i thought i pressed enter and confirm and said the same thing over and over again. Please fix this.,
"I was pulling my Facebook account, and it said there was something wrong, and I fixed it, and it was still telling me, you're something wrong. I give this app a one out of zero, no more than that.",
it lets you talk to friends and family and there is no bad language so it is very safe for starter kids this app I have had sence I was 3 years old. I love it and know I am 10 years old you should let your little kids use this amazing app.GOOD LUCK KIDS HAVE LOTS OF FUN ON THIS APP I LOVE YOU ALL THIS WILL ALSO L..................................... HELP YOUR KIDS LEARN HOW TO TAKE PITCHERS AND HOW TO LEARN TO TEXS,
I love messenger kids I get to see all my friends and everything the only problem is if the call my friends sometimes I just hear beating sounds and then it just says call ended now bye! ‚ô°,
Great app but emoji's and stickers stopped working today! Very frustrating. Hope it's fixed soon.,
I love this app!!!üòçüòçüòç. Its super safe fun for kids and everyone can stay in touch. you can text play games take pictures and video call.üìû,
very safe and kid friendly and my daughter absolutely loves this app although from my standpoint there could be some more options for the children to feel more as a dependent body in more freely,
This is so annoying I cant call my friend it keeps making that connecting sound when I'm at full bars. This app is the worst to use,
account creation failure is all I get when trying to get it to work. Deleted& reloaded 3 times& still does not work.,
"I have bluetooth headphones and anytime I try using my headphones with the app when I'm on a call it doesn't work. Please fix this, thanks üòí",
App seems to be bugged for a lot of people. Doesn't let you log in. Just log in over and over in a loop. Crazy a company this size can have an app broken this long .,
Great App!!! This App Is Especially For Kids. A Fun App Just For Kids. I Love It I Can Facetime Or Chat To My Friends Or Cousins. Great App!!! I Totally Recommend EveryBody Should Download This Fun App Just For Kids!!!,
Amazing app! Use it almost every day to contact my friends and there are rarely any glitches. The app is also very safe for kids,
"The most frustrating app ever, it won't let me create an account for my daughter I've been trying for 3 days now and no luck. F@#$ing stupid, no help anywhere!",
This app is trash I can't even create an account for my kid without it telling me I'm having an account creation failure!!!!! I even tried reinstalling the app still TRASH DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,
My daughter's friend can't see her due to covid 19. Now I can't get her off of her phone talking to her friends! Great app.,
Keeps saying no account found. I even tried changing my password and it wont work. Very disappointed that it didnt work! My son would've loved using this to talk to his grandmas and nana! ü§î‚òπüò°üëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº,
"This is good for my kids to be connected to friends and family. Play games, emojis, stickers and even learn their writing.",
This app is amazing for kids to text other friends!But the parents have to either be apart of your face book friends or the parents have to accept them as the friends!,
"I love this app but I can't change my text colors and i don't have many filters, other than that it is a great app!",
"I loved it so much. you could talk to your friends and family members. it has you make a profile so you know if you are talking to your friends, and your friends know that they are talking to you. I love ot so so much. I Hiley recommend this app you will have a amazing time on this app!!!!!üòâ",
It's alright but I can't add a majority of family members for some reason because it says they're not friends with my Facebook however they are if y'all can get that glitch fixed I'd give five stars,
I love it however... The new play games part were you can send an attachment to your freind and play a game with them is do glitchy I sent one and I did not see it sent so I sent another one... Could not see it so I sent it one more time and my friend got so annoyed that I was sending the same thing over and over. And my freind sent me a message and I was not on my phone but it said that I read her message so she was happy then she said hi and of course I was not on my phone so I did not respond,
I think that it is safe for children it has so many activities and then In case of an emergency you can text or call!,
was working well then a few days ago it stopped. The screen flickers and closes. Completely unusable.,
"This app is AMAZING! My kids can face time and text family members,friends,aunts,uncles,And grandparents without using my own phone.I definitely give this 5 stars!",
"It works perfectly for my cousin that I set it up for, never once did it not let me login. Overall great experience.",
Super nice and I can talk with my friends that have iPods and it's so much easier to talk to them now even though I have an Android!!,
It's a good app but every time I call one of my friends but every time I have to call them back in the middle of a call because it glitches out and I can't here them,
It was great until I upgraded phones went to install on new phone and now I can no longer authorise my daughters log on and we can not access her account or make a new one.,
The app is amazing but I HATE sleep mode update:it hung up on my friend and I can't even talk to them to say it hung up and it wasn't my fault ;-; The app sucks I would give 0 stars You can't even use bitmoji and there isn't that much filters I can't use filters anymore ;-;,
I have had this app for about 2 years and it great way to talk to friend and family and I love also because I not allowed to do real texting and calling so this is just such a great app,
Were having trouble getting connected to our grandkids. It doesnt pull up their names or anything. We put their name in on the one app then hit next thinking were gonna see them but here it was creating them another account. We dont understand how to work this crazy app. üò° very disappointed!!!!,
It works great. I don't have to remember her email or password. I know everyone who are or want to be my child's friend. It's perfect for any child,
Same issue as everyone else Im seeing.... Wont allow me past the parent log in.... So frustrating! I have unistalled and re installed several times and still nothing....,
Good app but there is glitches when you can't see your friend or it just will go mute for some reason and then you need to call back and if someone sends too much gifs your thing lags big time,
Hi I love this app but I would like it if you can delete messages because what if you send them to the wrong person I did that and now I'm embarest so I would like that update please!,
This is the best app I use to message my friends. One of my friends don't have a phone number so I have to use kids messenger to talk to my unnamed friends,
Garbage Keeps looping back to device authorization screen. Very very frustrating. Fix your apps Facebook!!,
I like it because I can communicate with my friends and family and texting and calling but no one really calls me anymore I try to keep communicateing with them so they don't block me,
On a iphone u can get pics for your profile from your gallery other phones cant and now i have to make me all dressed up just cus of this plz do SOMETHING about it. And for all of u who dont block but want to unfreind people here is what u do turn the notifications of.,
"This is very helpful as parents don't allow kids to go on Facebook! I really like the games too. Awesome app, keep it up!",
"Great app for kids! Gives me the ability to see who my daughter speaks to, what photos etc are shared and contact requests are approved by me. Love it.",
Hate this app both parent and child's is way to complicated with to many steps and just overall sucks plus it was always having issues. Would not recommend üòï,
It's a good app but it dosent work sometimes. Texts and calls can have delayed messaging. Also there should be BTS GIFs and poop emojis,
Messenger for Kids is terrific. It gives me a safe outlet for my children to be social using their mobile phones. It's easy to use and such cute designs.,
I think it's dum how you have to have a Facebook account in order to sign up.you should be able to sign up with one.When I try to sign up it says something went wrong and kicks me off.,
The app drains your battery and constantly crashes your phone. Avoid it at all costs.,
On my Phone I could not select a picture on it I had to take one. And i love everything else but also when i looked in settings everything was on so i have no idea. I am on Android,
It is a great app! I would totally down load the app if I were you. I haven't had any ads yet. Totally recommend it! #awesome app!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,
I have mixed feeling's about it. I'm still getting used to it. My son is only 2yrs old and going to be 3yrs old in August. He doesn't talk much so we only use it once in awhile.,
Pretty simple to use. I love knowing who connects with my child and the option to update the contacts.,
Can't log into either child's account on any device! This is their only way to talk to their friends at other schools - please fix this üòî,
"Horrible, not parent friendly whatsoever. How do you delete an account after you create one on accident. Its better just to wait for your kids to have their own account until they're of age. Absolutely ridiculous.",
"I love this app with my daughter but, sometimes she gets obsessed with it. It is fun and can help me communicate with my daughter.",
On one of the people I talk to every time try to type it restarts the app and it really aggravating me . Also I JUST put this person on there soooo.,
Theres only one best messanger kids and its this one.And I use this app to chat with my best friends.Its also the best way to interact with friends and family!!!,
This is a good app i use it all the time but i take two stars because i cant send people anything and it really gets me mad so i have to call people just to say a sentence.,
For all the kids and parents out there. I love it sooooo fun I call my frends all the time and you can call your mom and dad and frends and your parents control some things but I love this app get it I and it helps kids who love to chat with frends and you can play games while you call üìû‚ù§‚ô•üíôüíñüíï thx to who ever made this app. Stay same kids and parents alike,
"This app is the best of the best!! I love it so much!!! I love how you don't have to have a login or a passcode, you just put in a code and begin chatting!!",
Kicked out of app it is not letting me passed the login stage and says user not allowed access. Which makes me so mad as my daughter uses this app to contact her cousins. Keeps telling me user is now allowed access to app. This needs to be fixed RIGHT AWAY.,
"I cant find a way to log out or mute so, I dont have to hear all my childs message notifications and video calls. Extremely annoying!",
"Parental controls are locked behind the Facebook app not messenger app. I can't change any of my children's settings without installing Facebook, even if I have Facebook messenger installed.",
"It seems fine, but it never loads anything. No icons on buttons, no games, I can't even get to my contact list.",
Can't log in if password is wrong it tells you but when you put in the right password it loads and makes you log in again so you can't get past the log In screen,
It's amazing my daughter uses it on a cheap android phone but because of this app she can video chat family in other states! & I get notifications of when who and where!,
"I love it it's safe and my mom can control it, however latley if someone sends me a group of photos and I click on a Curtin one it takes me to the first overall I love it!!!",
Awesome and I love the way you can make funny faces and chat to friends and family of any age!! It's and awesome app,
Bluetooth only works on video messages. Does not work for video or regular calls.,
"I cannot find any info on how to transfer an existing messenger kids account to a new tablet. My son has a new tablet and when we open Messenger Kids app, it wants him to start a whole new account. He wants to keep his profile and all of his friends that he currently has. When I open Messenger Kids from my facebook profile all of his original content is still there so I am so frustrated. Any help or suggestions?",
I am able to talk to friends and family easly. It has super fun activities to do aswel as the filters they have they are super fun and you get a new one every day.,
This app is a great way to connect with friends. I've used it a lot especially over the pandemic. I highly recommend this if you have friends that live far away from you.,
I am in touch with my child all day while she is home with the babysitter and I am working. She loves the filters and that we can see each other while talking. She also loves being in touch with family. I love being in control and monthly updates of her activity.,
My daughter and my niece love this due to the coronavirus this is the best way that the family can get together. I recommend this to anyone super easy super fun,
This app is amazing because you get to text people and you get to have friendsit's just really awesome because I don't get to see my friends that much,
I love this game is so perfect for me to call my friends we really like chatting and I like the colours that you can change the colour of your texting and stuff I also like how you can like change your picture,
This app is great to text but lately I haven't been able to send any messages because it says its in sleep mode.,
"This is a very fun app, but it tells me to exit out a lot and is very slow some times. Over all it is a pretty good app.",
Same issue as below. Keeps looping back to parent email screen. It never allows authorization. Please fix!,
This program has stop working after the last update. Says it cannot connect to the internet. Have tried reinstalling with not luck.,
"Its slow and glitchy, really bad when sending messages. I sent a message and it actually sent to my friend 2 days later.",
It's not letting us create an account for my child on her phone or on my own phone. Please fix! I really want her to keep contact with my sisters. They are in the army and it will be the only way they can talk to my daughter.,
"This is such a great app! Its rarely laggy, and only works on wifi. You can chat with anyone your parent aproves, call them and take fun pictures and videos with fun filters, games and lenses. Also works with Facebook Messenger.",
I love it.i can send pictures to my friends and I can get friends and family on it I really recommend you get it is just aoo fun and you can call and its fun bc everything is just so fun with I before I did not have it and I wanna talk to my friends I could not call or see them so with this I can see them If there far away or if I am far away,
Been having trouble with this app it wont open soon as we click on it it says unfortunately messenger has stopped uninstall and reinstall multiple times even reset tablet back to factory settings still wont work,
i love this app but one day i turned off my phone and it had reset and it would not let me sign in if you could fix that it would be great!!,
Just a difficult app for parents to use. Can't add yourself as a contact to call your own child. What's the point of a kids app if parents can't call it?!,
I downloaded this app and it freaked my phone out!! And then it said I was trying to post something that was against Community standards. It locked my phone and now I can't post and I cannot do anything because of this stupid APP!! Unlock my account!!,
I wish after a certain time the messages would delete. My child's phone had no more space because it saved all the things she sent to her friends,
Nice all people i can communicate with works very well but i hate it when it automatically lags in the middle of my texting if that will not happen again then i will give it a iternal 5/5 rating for this app.,
I love this app. You can't call random people. There is many fun and appropite things you can send anybody you have asigned that you can have on the app.,
I try to sign up through the app and my Facebook and it won't let me. Says there's an error. Extremely irritated.,
this game is amazing well I wouldn't really call it a game but this app is amazing and I get to text my family members and it's kind of like message but for kids and it's really fun!,
I like it but in pledge planets the game called rough reviews there is a cat he or she is showing it's butt but they are covering it so it's kind of good for kids but not that much because of that i need that to be off because it's bad for kids but i like this app‚ò∫Ô∏è,
It's keep saying something went wrong,
It's is amazing and I feel secure knowing that the girls can only talk to family. My daughters went out of town with their grandparents and we talk all of the time.,
I love the app i can talk to my friends =) i love it but the only problem is its imposible to log in please fix it and the camera never works so i cant see my friends ever sad please fix ur app,
"Nice app, but its now stuck in a ""please update"" loop. I do, then it returns to the ""please update"" and wont leave it except to update it again.",
Guys the only reason it's laggy and buggy is problay because you have really bad WiFi and every body says that for everything it's laggy and buggy it's doesn't work when really you need better WiFi just use the real messenger and I'm 11 really people just give a actual review not just say it is laggy and stuff like thats not going to help the person make the app better is October 18 who don't read this are really stupid not saying your not smart I'm just saying get better WiFi and it will,
This is very good for me sometimes I go on it sometimes I go on different stuff like like like as going on this it makes me feel kind of good because for my because you're myself it's really my making a difference I got to text it on my friends and stuff I can't see them and stuff,
Pretty good but it won't let me send some emojis and won't let me update on my android tablet I wish it could just call to not only text and video chat but over all its a really good app,
"Imagine having to keep images on your device for other people to see your image text or not being able to delete texts you didn't mean to send, could you imagine?",
The app is really good you can call and text your friends you can get this on a phone tablet or even a computer thier is nothing wrong with the app I highly recommend this app,
This is awesome as my 8 year old is able to contact friends and family. Along with I'm able to monitor and view it from my very own Facebook.,
Why not make a computer version of this application? Not all kids have hand-held devices but having a way to communicate with other kids and family members while on a computer would be really valuable.,
That is really good because I can't talk to my cousins and I can when I go on sleepovers I can actually talk to people and I think it's very cool down messenger kids and it's always like having message with adults like you're a teenager,
You can text people all around no matter if it's across the country I have had it for months and it hasn't caused any problems highly recommend trying it out,
Unable to sign into my account to see my child's messages. Also unable to create a new account for additional child. Continue to get error message that I am unable to log in.,
Really fun it's good that you can play games and stuff but I think they should add a night mode really fun but I think it could improve,
I give it a four just bc there's not a lot of good filters and there's only a face time button and no call button but other then that it's it's good,
Unavailable on my region I hope this gets activated or be readily available in all regions.it sucks as it is not available to everyone. This is very disappointing and a little discriminating.,
"Can't login, parent can't even login even after resettig facebook password. Very ireiratin and annoying. Looking BETTER app.",
I love talking to my friend on this app my friend is moving and where ever your friends go you can still text them from far away this app is the best app i ever had its cool,
Very good apk,
I keep missing messages and video calls from my niece and nephew because this app does not tell me when anything is received. These kids think I'm neglecting them because of this issue.,
Can't authorize the device. Seems to be an issue for lots of people but has not been fixed. It's very frustrating.,
Loved it when it first came out. The app keeps crashing & can't even use it since the last update a few weeks ago,
"I love this app, but in the morning it says unable to send, so I can't talk to anyone in the morning. Please fix this. After a few hours, I can talk again.",
"It's a really good app don't get me wrong but, they should add a phone call button so if you don't want to text or video chat then you can call people",
It is the best app ever I can text my friends and my parents you get to take funny photos and play games and it has no ads and that is awesome but it dose need inter net.üòÅüòÄü§©üòú,
With everything going on with the virus right now I'm thankful friends told me about this app. My son has been able to stay in contact with love ones and friends.,
This app has been great for helping my kids adjust after a move. They are able to keep in touch with all of their old friends.,
"Its an amazing way for kids to communicate safely! Don't worry about what your kids are texting, messenger kids has got your back!",
I liked it at first but when I put in my profile picture it would always be side ways or upside down but if they fixed that I'd give it 5 stars overall.,
I love this app am 12 so I have to have messager kids love the app but maybe st of the time I don't get the notifications and it's really hard because my daddy trys to text me but I don't get the notifications,
messenger kids is a graet app from texing and callinf to all the fun mini games inside of it it is a graet way to comunicate with others and make your own videos i am giving this a four star rating because sometimes the audio can mess up sometimes,
It kept on saying while they were creating the account there was a failure. I counted and it is literally my 74th time trying! üòë,
I love this app because i csn hang out with my besties on face time. But i hsve s request. My request is that add new filters but dont take the old ones away. Its sad to see the old ones go,
Was fine until today when we tried to login into a new device and it won't let me authorise and keeps going back the login page. Fix this asap please!!!,
"this is so fun to use! I add friends and family to chat with.. Me and my cousin face time all the time on our parents phones.. But now, We don't need there phones!!",
"K can send me notifications but I cannot find her after downloading messenger kids to my android. There is a flaw/ error in this app. I can down load her sister and the rest of the family, just not her.",
I love this app it's like so amazing like you could text people and stuff and there's so much different things you could do the job pictures and stuff,
"The app needs you to constantly re-sign in and this often triggers a login in failure. Not due to the user, but due to the system",
"I think messenger kids is the best option for kids to stay in contact with others.Examples of what you can do, Take silly videos, talk with friends and family,Grow your pet,Use fun filters,And most of all having fun!!!!",
Love it. You can have control over who does or doesn't talk to your kids. They can't delete messages. And a great way for them to talk to their friends during isolation,
Please don't add any update because I can't update it it seems like sometimes most of the time I can but I really like this app otherwise from the updates it is really really fun and I love hanging out with my friends when I'm at the beach I can't really call them but I still can call if I'm on the phone I love it,
I love this app it makes it super fun to talk to my friends but we send each other videos that we animate and sometimes it wont send it should tell u y u can't send it but other wise itsa good app,
"would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the links because you have to answer a question for EVERY link you click and if you close the link then click it again then you have to answer ANOTHER QUESTION just to open the link and i actualy was going to give 4 stars but i hate it so much that i will give it 3 stars but other than that i realy like this app, and also you have to get a parent to allow permission to even use links so i don't get the whole question thing so yeah you should fix this please",
Please fix the issue of not being able to log in... I can see it is happening to multiple users .. I have been trying to log in for ten days now ...,
My daughter loves being able to talk to her friends and loved ones without having a lot of instructions to follow I appreciate that you made this app for kids it's great they feel like their parents I love it,
Great way to connect definitely install I recommend it for young kids and all the like 10 and 14 it's so good I can connect with all my friends and my cousin I love it,
Absolutely sucks. I don't get any messages and I often have to take plane rides and sometimes this is the reason why I miss important information,
its glitching so much i call my cousin and she accsepts but then it dosent show and it looks like she didnt accsept and when she calls me i accsept but then in 21 secconds it hangs up she called me again but then she couldent hear me only i could hear her but when it used to work it was good,
"Irritating, I have tried multiple times to make an account for my daughter and it keeps saying failure, even after deleting and redownloading the app",
I use this app because most of my friends can't use messenger and I installed it so I can talk to them and it has no ads which is GREAT I am glad the messenger company made this(Btw please sub to my channel: The PhoenixYT),
Can't create account. Gives me a message that it had an issue but there's nowhere to get help or send feedback.,
It is awesome because i can text all my friends and call them without getting into trouble because my parents are watching me text my friends and sence I don't have a apple phone a ipad instead i can still FaceTime and text my friends,
It won't even let me create an account for my daughter. It just keeps telling me there was an error trying to setup the account. Stupid.,
"I love this app. I can talk to my family and friends and it has fun games and your can grow a pet and stuff if someone does lower than 5 stars I will be very mad. 5 stars definite, and get this app for kids and adultsüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄit works anywhere too and I am so happy with this app but one thing there is no poop emoji I wish u could name people what u want",
"This app works so well with my children, I can talk to them anywhere. I love it. I recomend Getting it for your children too.",
"The video from it's filter app, I can't download, save or even forward it to others. How unfortunate. üòî",
Great way for my child and I to keep in contact with each other as well as friends especially during this time of social distancing.,
Been trying to download the app for days now and won't allow me to. Says there was an issue creating a page. FIX!!,
This is the best app I've ever experienced that's why I'm even in a five because I get to FaceTime my cousin like every day and she's not sad about that she actually loves messenger kids and I have that and she has it so it's a five for me,
Does not allow me to sign in. Keeps refreshing back to the log in screen. Even after the update. Useless now. Please fix,
The video and chat thing is so cool but I have to devices and the 1 is my ipad it glitch but I usually use my phone and great idea for the texting and calling for kids and parents have to accept the friend request. GREAT JOB!üòáü§©üòáü•≥,
My great-granddaughter uses Messenger to send me pictures or ask me silly questions. I think she has about five different accounts now. She keeps changing stuff all the time but I still love her. And enjoyed being on here with her since we live 1200 miles away from each other.,
"This is a great app for parents who want to protect their kids. I'm giving it a 3 star rating, though, because I've got notifications 3 days after it was sent.",
"My son is using my old Samsung S20 plus and I have been unable to log in to messenger kids. I put in my password and it kicks me out, I have been trying to log in for the past 3 days. Hope this glitch get fixed soon.",
it's a good app for kids to chat with friends and family further away. also it keep the kids from bad people because parents can control who the chat with at a young age..,
This app was great and then it wouldn't open Uninstaller it and reinstalled and it still won't open been trying for days. Fix bugs please,
I love this app because it just allows me to chat with friends and see what my kid is texting to his friends! So any adult out there download this app and you will thank this message!,
"This app is good for children. The only thing i don't like its that u can only request a code once. Bit other then that, five stars.",
This app usually works fantastically well and allows my daughter to talk to her friends. Overnight she somehow was logged out and now is stuck in an endless loop of trying to log in. Not very happy with this since it's the start of school holidays here and she now has no way to chat to her friends as she normally would.,
The app will not let me authorize the device and keeps kicking me back to the login. Constant loop of not be able to loggin and authorize device.,
Always getting error messages when I try to approve new contacts. Please fix as this has been happening for over 2 months now,
I love because you can make friend on this app and that is so good because if you need help your friend are also there too my friend on. The app and me talk all the time and we're I am it snowing,
"it is soo fun! me and my cousin message on it all the time. i have real texting, but my cousin doesnt so, that makes this a great app.",
"This app is a pain in the butt, I am having a really bad time with this, I've noticed that alot of people are experiencing the same problem as well, this is so damn frustrating, I don't recommend üòï.",
Really good app for if u want to see friends and ur friend doesnt need this app to chat :) there is Aton of glitches tho not hearing voices chat glitching calls glitch ect but overall really good game,
"Great for kids! I can text and call my friends, and they have games you can play, just a great app if your a kid and want messenger",
"I love this app because whenever I get bored I play games but some I can't play because it loads a long time, but its ok! I like chating with all my friends!",
strongly recommend this app totally safe for kids I absolutely love it and it's also a great way for kids to keep in contact with relatives and it's fun,
every time I try to set it up it says no internet. my child has messages but I can't get to them since it won't let me finish setting it up. Uninstaller and reinstalled still not working,
I love this aop but there are so many promblems like when im on a call and playing a game my screen will flash off and on. Second it will auto hang up my call after 2 minutes so fix theese pls,
Love it i have it on my iPad i talk to my friends its so great its safe and for kids but theres one problem when I press mute button it say calling and do calling mean there picking up and when I press the chat button it say the same thing can you fix that also how do I get the thing you know with the star on top with the wand I how do I change the thing instead of have it pick one for me and how can I get background last one can you tell me how to put games and make a group chat thing thanks.,
This is SO STUPID!!!! WHY DO YOU NEED A STUPID FACEBOOK ACCOUNT üò† WHY CAN'T ANY APP JUST BE SIMPLY CREATING A ACCOUNT FOR IT AND BE DONE!!!! THEY CAN'T ASSUME YOU HAVE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT!!!!üò†üò† HOW STUPID!!! I HATE THIS SO SO MUCH!!! IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME DOWNLOADING IT!!! IT LOOKED COOL!! BUT THANKS FOR RUINING MY REPUTATION!!!üò†üò†,
Useless. Cannot log in. Cannot connect to grandson. App loops to asking to authorize device. Uninstalling. Don't bother with it. A waste of time.,
"I try to log in, but it says I'm not allowed. So I bought a whole new phone, still says I'm not allowed. I have everything correct. A couple months ago I tried and it said something different. This app just doesn't like me.",
I do think it be fun if you could chose a picture instead of having to take one every time but other than that I love it!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,
Because it's really good and I can always talk to my friends show me bad thing is one time I sent my friend a picture of a bunny it got deleted and sent my mom message that said your child was being inappropriate on the app,
its really fun you can chat with your friends and grow your pet is so cool you can get diffrent pets as you evolve and the games are my favorite becuase im a gamer so ya it must be destiny..,
Hi so I enabled links for my child to send links to me even though it's on there a glitch where it won't send and it doesn't work for anyone hoping you could fix it asap,
"AMAZING! I can talk to all my friends and family, I can play games, funny photos! It's a while different level",
I feel that messenger kids is a hood way to connect with frirnds but after a little bit of having it it start lag like videos on call will freeze i wont be able to hear my friend or they cant hear me. And i'll type a sentence and it will be deleted. Then also most of my cotact wont show up,
Im injoying the app alot being able to text friends. A bug in the game that keep stoping and doing is it says I've got a notification but I dont but this app is realy good,
Same issues as stated by other reviews--will not sign me in as parent. Keeps routing me back to the login screen no matter which entry route I attempt. :/,
It will not let me make an account and I had put all of the information in that it wanted me to put in and I thought it was something with my wifi but it wasn't and I have a Facebook account so I don't understand why it didn't work,
Love this app let's my kids talk to all there friends I love it so go down load this app,
I just love the app especially during covid-19 it's very helpful to get in touch with friends and family I even got one of my friends from school on my list,
It's a great app but it's only flaw is that you can't download videos that people send you so maybe that can be an added feature,
"Worked good for a while, and now it won't let me log in. Keeps saying Unable to log in your child, try again? So we keep trying and the same message keeps popping up.",
To much static feed back. Hard to hold a decent conversation with the sound and voicies. Did please how do I make a better contact????,
This app is very fun for kids who can't text youthat's why I love it cuz I can't use the grown up at but I can use it till this is very fun even though your parents can see it it's so good üòÇ,
"Can't authorize my child's account on my android phone or tab... sends me in to a login loop of doom and just keeps asking over and over for my password. Tried the ""one time email code"" too - same result. Useless!",
This one of the best apps for kids because your kid can talk to their friends but if your kid is a only child this is a good way for your kid to talk to their friend.This is one of the most trusting app for a kid.,
"It doesn't allow you to log in, you go through the login screen and it immediately logs you out again and makes you log in again just over and over again.",
so far it's really nice and I like how the parents had the contacts. I would like for it to be added to where the parents could know the location of the kids and no one else.,
It's a nice app. BUT THEY TAKE AWAY FILTERS AND DONT BRING THEM BACK AND CHANGED THE FILTERS IN THE CALL AND MADE THE üëçüèªFILTERS CREEPY. Overall a good app to talk to my friend and my family members,
"Good idea/concept. Good parental controls but why cant my child's contacts send gifs to him. At first i thought this was maybe cuz you cant filter gifs to be child friendly, but my child is able to send gifs to his contacts so that dont make sense",
LOVE IT!!! I love having free communication with my friends and family. Its awesome. I highly recommend downloading this app. AWESOME!! üëçüèª,
This game is very good for kids and you can make friends with it too and if your friends have the same app then you can friend them too it's really good.,
This app is terrible it doesn't let you sign in with a valid password to start a new account. Trash app!!!,
"This app is not intuitive or user-friendly at all. My child already has an account set up by my wife and I am just trying to connect to that, yet this app is forcing me to create yet another account for the same child.",
"Not safe. My kid was sent a nude by one of her friends. You would think that the app would be able to prevent that, as this is for kids. It does limit who they can talk to though.",
Can't get beyond authorizing a device. Enter correct info for that same screen to come back. Super annoying!,
I can't get my child logged on. It keeps looping and taking me back to sign in and authorize device. Very very annoying and pissing me off!!!!,
It is a good app if you want to contact your friends or you parents you can play games and take funny photos with yourself or with your friends I love this app,
Very very good i can call my friends and talk to them in so many different ways through the chat but a little slow and has the occasional glitch,
"Garbage, seriously wasted 2 hours of my life and it wouldn't even login, just endlessly cycled back to the login screen every single time.",
Amazing app but I don't like how you can't send links to yt.and it's now not letting Me send vids but it's still an amazing app love it lots of my bffs have it and love it definitely recommend!,
"This app is very usefull and fun. My daughter always uses this app to text and call her freinds, Messesnger Kids never alows kids to delete messages and it connects to regular messenger so she can text me.",
"I like the idea of this, but really would like to be able to skip part of putting profile picture and data",
This is fun to connect with family members and close Friends my kid named ava loves this app so i Recommend it to stay in touch with family members and close friends during the pandemic. We are all in .,
Recently I'm trying to sign in to my daughter's kid messenger Facebook and I can't log in with my information anybody else having this problem or is it just my luck So I uninstalled it reinstalled it and try to sign in I get so far and and it kicks me right back to the beginning of identifying who I am,
Tried setting it up and I keep getting an error message. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still can get set up.,
Keeps crashing and tell my LO that her app is sleeping even when it's in the hours I have set for her to use it. In case on emergency it needs to work and it does not,
This is perfect for kids to text their family and friends I love this app because it's like snapchat for kids you can take pictures and text friends I love this app so much,
Its great but when they can text please take out like the pet stuff that makes them feel like little kids and we love the picture taker!,
this is a wonderful way for my kids to be safe on Facebook I really appreciate you guys making this kind of system it's really easy to use all my kids know how to use it all my family knows how to use it we are all enjoying this app I hope this app just makes more improvements and mix it funnel for my kids to use and they already love using it so thank you I just think you,
Fix the app. I tried making an account multiple times and it always says there was a problem afterwards. >:(,
Unable to complete the setup process without having an error popup saying to try again later. I've been trying to for the past few days with no success.,
"Great app, free app, kids messenger. It's easy to use, and safe for kids. And there is no ads. Unlike Justalk kids, this app is free. And better. 5 Stars.",
Won't let us log in...keeps going around in a loop once log in details have been entered..then goes straight back to the log in pages again.,
Well i have been chattign with my friends! and it great love the emojis and super fun to use and its just a really good app so yea make sure to downlaod it!,
Whats happening with the app? I cannot log in. I cannot authorize the device. There is an endless loop of logging in..,
"I'm not able to create an account for my kid. A message will always pop up on the screen with ""Account Creation Failure."" Please tell me what to do to fix this problem",
This is fine. But I want the new update to be that there‚Äôs silver and gold colour in the ‚Äúdecorate your app‚Äù section. It‚Äôll be better.,
So me and my friend call each other alot and everytime we call around 5-6 o''clock it starts glitching and i will accept her call and then it says missed call and when i call her it just says muted and video off when she tries to answer,
"is there a way to read my daughters messages between her and her friends from my phone? when i go to her accout on my phone it says ""activity"" but all thats listed under it is friend suggestions. i should be able to monitor her messages without taking her tablet to look.",
I cant download this app i don't know why i have been waiting for 1hour!! Pls fix it,
after setting it up and adding only a few family and friends i cant figure out how to add more family. Im not liking this app already!,
This is terrible it doesn't even work I can't create a account or anything üòï,
"I love messenger kids I can talk to all my friends. It have many games, for one person or more. And thank you very much who made this program. I love it so much. üåπ",
I love this app I can talk to my mom dad anybody that I know this app is just amazing as I amüòÄ,
I love it but it won't let me and my friend call and we are long distance friends,
Needs alot of improvement to be up to standard most importantly why doesn't it send me notifications? Id like to know when there is an unread message,
I love this app perfect for my little brother!,
Why isn't there dark mode for the android version???,
The only problem I have with this app is it's glitchy.,
Very hard to add friends,
I like this app but I would like it if you added nicknames for it,
It bugs most of the time,
This app not working i try to create my kids account but problem there,
Best thing to use to chat with your friends and family .,
It is a great opportunity for kids to call you and there friend i has I lot of fun calling my friend and my mom and dad,
I love that I can see who my child can or can't text,
Oh my God I love it I can easily find my mom and dad and I can easily call my friends and see if they are available for me üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ please download it you won't regret it ‚ù§Ô∏è,
after downloading it would not let me login with the email I had just used to login in to my facebook account. this app is a waste of time.,
I think messenger kids is a really great app you get to FaceTime the people you know text them and it even gives you cool games to play it is very great for kids and family I recommended,
"It's great for my boys, especially for the 1 who would get in my adult messenger and ""call"" literally everyone on my contacts. So this allows me to pick and choose the people he can talk to!",
So far is excellent. To be able to communicate with our grandchildren that live on another State is a plus. Thank you!,
I too am experiencing being unable to sign in with correct password. It just takes me right back to the sign in screen. Please help,
I like the app overall but I do miss the older version. If you could bring it back that would be awesome.,
I cant log in on it. I had to get a new phone and i trying logging in on it but it keeps telling me that it cant find my Facebook account.,
Great app for my daughter. She's 10 and doesn't need her own phone just yet but now she can text and video chat her friends.,
Its a good app but I can't add anymore people. The person I am trying to add has messsenger. I have added people with messenger before though.,
Doesn't let me sign in. I use the right login info. And it just basically refreshes the page to where i have to re-input the login info.,
"I dislike this app because your parents can see what you're texting to people, who you're texting, and when. It's just another way for parents to envaid their children's privacy!",
Omg so get this app it's so fun I love it's so much it's so fun you can take pics and send them to your friends when ever you want there are really cute filters and everything üíó,
"This app is cool üòé. You can talk with strangers I mean friends, family and more. But also if someone wants to friend you, then your guardian has to give permission for you to be friends with someone. A",
"I love it so much!! Especially during this time when i cant see my friends, so i can text them.",
"Love the app , enables my kid to communicate with friends and family and able to .monitor them and make sure it's safe!!!",
For some reason it's not letting me create an account I've tried a thousand times and it says account failure oh my gosh and every single day I tried it and it still says account failure this is so annoying,
The app is amazing for kids you can call people you can text them I just wish that there were more cuter filters maybe not for kids plus no ads which is great,
need to be able to add actual birthday. my grandkids wanted me on here. i was able to just skip the birthday part. said i was too old. could this be a problem with people who are not on here for the right reasons? should be able to have a grandparent setting or something. just a thought.,
this app is great but it takes a little bit to send massages. But either then that its perfect. and very safe for kids.,
I love this App because now I can call and text friends with apple phones. It's cool because I can vid chat my friends who live far away. That's why I am giving it a five star.,
Love this app easy to monitor and always notify me when someone's communicate with the adults when there's a issue or message or response great app and love security features.,
I am currently experiencing what everyone else is experiencing with Android. Stuck in a loop of not being able to log in.,
"Why are there so many glitches? I try to text my friend, and then, it says Unable to send. They can text me, but I can't them.",
It has all the things needed for kids to talk to friends and family members. I think it would be BETTER if there was a way you could search up the person or group chat so you know where they are!,
I love messenger kids but there are a few things I would like the creator to know like my texts sometimes don't get delivered till Hours later and they need to put a timer on the profile picture thing plz tell the creator to see this and to fix this and all the other bugs ty,
When you press create account it keeps on rejecting it and not letting me create me and my friend want to talk but it wont let me and her mom doesnt let her get anything else so now I cant text her it really sucks. It should definitely get fixed,
This app sucks!!! Takes my info to log in my child but doesnt pop up...better not be using this app to get into peoples accounts! Changing my password already anyways,
Awesome app. Easy to use. Only thing is I have more than one kid so it seems I can't use more than one messenger kids with the same Facebook account.,
Its a great app but I cannot type in it for some reason and then when I try to type in other apps it works so if anyone can fix it I would appreciate it,
Great app! I am just quite irradiated by not being able upload a picture from my photo gallery. Please fix this.,
"If I could I wouldn't give any star. Same problem as everyone, i can't login for some reason and that sucks. Uninstalling right now.",
"I have been trying for over a week to register an account, but keep on getting the same error message (Account Creation Failure, please try again later).....",
"Can't find my granddaughters on it! Downloaded the app and can't find them. Sending pictures to myself, go figure.",
This app was really helpful for my kid. Instead of doing apps on her ipad she is accally reading! thank you thank you thank you! my kid is now amazing at reading. I certanlly reccomend this app.‚ù§Ô∏è,
"i love spending time with my grandkids any way i can This app is a safe way to see and play with them. now with this covid virus social distancing, it is a life saver. Thank you<3",
So much fun I can talk to my friends I don't have to go anywhere like for kids or you can FaceTime all your friends because of Covid-19 you can't really see people,
I love this app because I have three cousins that live really really far away and I only get to see them when I go to my dad's and I mostly only go there for two days üò≠üò≠ but it is school holidays so I got to go there and also I chat to some friends,
"From my experiences a great app. You can play games, send videos, and send pictures to you friends.",
Stopped working. Cannot login. After entering credentials it shows the the login screen again.,
Because you could set it up on you could have it on your phone too so that's cool oh yeah it's really just fun and you can look at what your kids doing and stuff texting you whatever India,
Can't seem to add new friends. Whatever is happening in the background to connect us is not coming through all the way.,
Don't give it a five stars because there is a glitch and sometimes your microphone does not and the other person can't hear you so kind of hard to give it a five stars,
Why are the parents unable to communicate with our children in this app??! So frustrating. It's literally the only purpose our kids have the app. Uninstalling,
Will not let me log in. I type in password and it goes back to log in screen.. I've tried on 2 separate devices and same thing.,
"Can anyone tell me how to fix a bug that keeps saying ""unable to send message""? Video calls will work.",
"it's a good app but I'm on a Motorola phone and I can't change my profile picture!! it's annoying, I made another account but it wouldn't let me change my profile pic in general!! so I am quite mad üò§",
Now this truly a good app for kids to use and connect with family that lives far. I truly recommend parents to get this app for family members that lives far can stay into touch with the kiddies.,
Wonderful i love it,
Messenger kids. There are inappropriate emojis like a 69 number rotated so the 6 on top and it's in the love tab. There are more bad ones in there. It also does not censor swear words (I tested) but blocks out things that aren't inappropriate.,
i love this app it alows me to communicate with family members but some times when i try to video call it dosnt work. it will let me answer but i cant see them then it will hang up. please fix this .,
"I like the app and all the security features, however I couldn't add my childs father to her contacts because he is not my fb friend. Would like to see an update with this option in future plz",
I made the account on face book it was all fine but then I accidently deleted it i rw instead it show e d all my other profiles except the one I used the most I went back to fav3 book it was there it just didn't tlwt me log ontk it every account that I make on facebook.it doesn't show up on messenger kids please helppp,
"I have had this app for months now. Why I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because what they removed from the original app! Nothing is wrong with the app, it's just the features.",
Camera doesn't work on app. Close the app and open camera app and that's frozen also. I have to force stop camera app and restart device just to get camera app back working!,
Its amazing I love it I really di but sometimes if you friend someone they dont get none of your calls or texts for some people other then that its amazing please fix it.,
It amazing but one thing they need to change is adding friends the kids should be alowed to add kids insted of codes for it it dose something to my facebook acc but it safe cool and amazing bc i get to see all my kids pictuers & textses she sends to her friend,
I love this game because it's amazing and I can't text people because I'm a kid but I can text people when it's on kids messenger so I'm always happy to keep my friends and family by my side so I don't know where they are and that makes me happyüòäüòäüòä,
Its a pretty good app buy when on call it will randomly hang up other then that everythings fine. Ps might wanna make it with not needing intrenet to use insted to use with no wifi,
I like that my kid can connect with his friends and that I can see who they're talking to. I wish we could see the parents names with each request. That would make it easier to find them and get friend codes.,
This app is AMAZING because I can talk to friends that don't have messages to where they can text me but this app can let me text them and it's AWESOME!!! RATE ME!!,
"Would be a great app if it would even let you log in. Tried on tablet and phone, does the same log in loop. Disappointing.",
The app is great I call my friends pretty often but the android users aren't getting the apple update and it really annoyed me when I found out they didn't let Android get the update.,
My daughter loves the app. I like that she has a safe way to stay in contact with friends and family that is her own but I am able to monitor it. Definitely recommend.,
"my daughter loves this app but it seems to have problems with the sleeping hours. I think this company needs to fix it, please thank you",
"I downloaded this for my son, so he can communicate with his cousins, it was the best mistake i ever did, now he calls me every day even when I'm in the same room with him, always talking to his cousins. SO CUTE. üòÉ Great app.",
People call me all the time and its just annoying its my coisen and friends its a good app but if you can make it so people will get a messege if there calling to much thanks bye,
My kid and her bestie are on her all day and sometimes all night. Especially in these times this is great for them to keep in contact with her friends.,
Had to get a new phone... doing the SAME thing everyone else is complaining about...not letting me confirm my device.... emailed the developer 2 days ago and NO response... imagine that.,
I love to call my friends and Text them all day long this app is helpful the only issue is that the fillters don't work as well.‚ò∫,
AMAZING!My favourite app is this app because I love to chat with my friends soo much it the most favourite kids app in the world of course we all love it even grownups like it. HOW EVER I LIKE IT!,
It was good to use because you can monitor your child about using or messaging other people. It is really guided so I may not worry to allow my child to use messenger.,
"This is an anmaing app. Kids should be able to change the names though such as ""dad "" or ""mom"" that is the only thing i would change",
Good messengering app without a phone number. But you have to have a Google account or Facebook account. Other than that good app. Also has games on there. Free too.,
"I think the app is great, I like how I can stay in control with how she is interacting on the app. I also really like how I can see who she talks to on the app, or everything that is shared on the app, from my phone. I'd recommend it if your thinking about letting your child download and use this app.",
"Not impressed that the parent features don't work with either Messenger or Facebook Lite! I hate that I am having to install 2 apps that bloat horribly, just to hit approve on my kid's request. Irritating. >:(",
Can't open messenger kids account for 11 months. I receive an error message every time. I've asked FB for help at least 25 times!,
I can't authorize my kids' new device as it keeps disconnecting and sending me back to login page. It shows as allowed on facebook parent dashboard but won't load.,
Im a kid and I of this app but it is annoying how when you're on call you can only text that one person and I wish you could add our of your friends onto call.,
"I was using this app and a random video poped up,I was able to text something to the person who sent it to me so I said, ""Uhm,ma'am,I'm too young for this so I think you got the wrong person"" and the next day my mom showed me on her facebook the text message and I found out that I said that to her firend so please fix this because my mom didn't get mad at me,but the app so please,fix this",
Beautiful idea. But android versions does not support changing profile pic. IOS has the option. Please take a note about it.,
"Good!But, can you make it so you can change the sound of the video chat sound when your getting called or whatever you want(AND PLZ LET US CHOOSE WHAT SOUND OR WHATEVER WE WANT)(Also plz add more filters..thx!)",
Great t9 talk to friend,
This app is AWSOME it is a good way to talk with your friends. You can go ahead and online chat them. You can go ahead and Call them THERE ARE A BILLON THINGS ON HERE TO USE. It is a great way to talk.,
I like the app other than they have full access to all the emojis. thr middle finger emoji should not be accessible on an app made for kids.,
Its a great app but for some wierd reason it dosent let me text on of my friends when i do it says unable to send so im very mad beacaus eidk what happened so if the createres are listening can u text me how to fix it pls,
My wife started one for my daughter and it doesn't work correctly. It sent me a link to add her and then just duplicated her profile.,
"So I had issues ""authorising device"" after I accidentally logged out, and I'm still not in my account. 2 stars.",
"Whenever I call on my phone, it doesn't show my screen to the other person. They also ruined the emoji filters and now I dislike them, lol.",
I like it overall..minus one little glitch..since I set up the account and she is under my profile..she cant video chat with me if she is away. Set it up so she can still contact me.,
Superb I use this to connect with my family and friends and you can also use super cute and cool masks and also hamster üêπ and the dog üêï look cute and the best thing is you can even edit pics from your gallery love it and pls add more cute filters you can try on,
"When I try to change my profile picture it always turns in sideways and it's freaking annoying, if you could fix this bug it would be great üôÑ",
"I Love the App its very smart and Clever So i get to call My cousin's and my friends away from my city and family far away i think this app is the best, and the visit's make my mind blown anyways so the way that you need face book to sign in i dont find that much apps that need facebook to get in but i think its a good kid app oh and its kids messenger so kids messenger could speak to your parents messenger's account on the adult app of messenger this is why i give it a 5 star:D this is the best",
This is an amazing app for kids to chat with their friends! Its helping the kids organise playdates for themselves its such a great idea for awesome kiddos!,
Unable to reinstall Messenger kids on android tablet. Extremely disappointed and frustrated. If I can rate it a zero 0-stars I would.,
"its amazing for me and my friend! during COVID-19,i can see and chat with my friends and comunicate with them! we LOVE this app and keep this up messanger kids! typed by Bella Edwards 8 year old",
This is a perfect way of staying in touch with family and friends. Especially during COVID-19. It really helped!!!!!!!!!,
"Error message ""something went wrong"" Tried multiple platforms. Not working. Cannot get past setup.",
This has great potential and easy to manage. One big hangup is the sleep mode. Please make each day individual to schedule!?,
"Amazing app safe fun and you can learn to be responsible with grow your pet and you play games chat ,facetime and you learn to stay safe love it if I could I would give it so much more stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
it is very buggy their is no option to do a voice chat and its very glitchy when you're in a call but the rest of the app is decent,
"This app is really good, But please put a warning if you accidentaly hit ""log out"" I just got logged out of my account because my finger pressed the button not on purpose and I cant fix it",
it's a good app for kids and you can set tone limits that make it's so the font stay on it forever and so the go to bed earlier so if I were you I'd get it,
"Amazing. Always working, never glitches. Just 1 thing, after I while I cannot what videos I send or receive",
"Can't login, it just keeps going back to login page after entering user and password. Uninstall and reinstall doesn't help.",
"Hey I just got into the controls but my parents keep changing the password , this app is filled with adults if you are a kid do not use this , normal messager is good , you just have to put in a age over 14 , this also needs a adult to open it so I recommend making a fake Facebook account to get around that",
Can't even log on. Was working great when suddenly it was not. I thought it was a safe way to keep up with the kids and all their activities. Not so much,
I love this but there are some problems like u can't delete messages ir contacts and somtimes i send the wrong thing yo the wrong person and maby there could be some more entertaining games,
"The app was working well but I now can't log in anymore ,I am stuck in a loop , messenger keep asking for logging details, it s very frustrating, please fix asap",
"There's no way to report inappropriate messages to Facebook; only able to report content to the main account holder (adult/parent/caregiver, ect) Not cool, please fix this.",
For some reason I can't log in I cant get past the terms exceptions. it says account failure. Please can someone help spent two hours on this,
This app is good for communicating with friends if your under 13 but the bad thing is that you cant send gifs that you downloaded to your device and you cany send links.,
"Its the best to call others at home and play games with them,my favorite part is you can get you own pet and have fun with your pet.",
It is ok except for the fact that when I try to change my picture it turns it sideways or if it's edited it won't let me use that picture btw subscribe to capybarasbSlay on YouTube,
I tried to make an account for my son and I put in the right information but it kept on saying something went wrong. I'm not sure why and even if I reinstall it does not change.,
Good for texting friends but would be great if u could add some more games that we can play during a call!,
"For some reason I am not able to create a account when I try to it says account creation failure, something went wrong while we were creating your child account. Please try again. But when I try again it says the same thing",
"I love using this app but there are some downsides, one of the downsides is that it doesn't always alert you when people txt you!",
Awesome app for kids to be able to keep in touch with friends and family üòÅüòÅüòÅlove the ability to choose who you have on this app to chat to,
It's really fun and I really like this app but you don't get to actually let your friends know that you're calling them if they're calling somebody else so I wanted to see if you could fix that,
It's been a good way for my kids to stay in touch with family and friends. I like that I can monitor who they are talking to and who they are friends with. One problem we've had is that my kids tablets will say they are in sleep mode even outside the parameters I have set. Not sure why the app does this...?,
Used to be great and now it's completely useless. Cannot login and the company does not seem to care. Not one person's concerns have been answered. Poor form.,
The new layout updated for one of my children but not for the other? And I'm not getting app notifications even though notifications are all turned on?,
It's a good app to text and call your friends and family I use it to call my cousin and it has way better connection compared to hangouts its a AWESOME appüòéüòéüòéüòé,
"Its ok, the only thing is that it won't say ""you have an update"" it just flat out stips working, if there was a reminder or warning of some kind it would make it better",
Best messenger for kids. Works REALLY well. Only problem is it does buffer sometime while video chatting. But i think its just my internet,
I blocked my friend on here for a joke and now no matter we do we still can't see images we send and it doesn't show that we're friends on our profiles and I can't talk to them if they don't send me a message first because I have to click on the notification,
Ok I didn't even start this but from the beginning why use Facebook like some people don't have it and I'm not getting it just to talk to my friends why can't u just set it up using something else like email or something so I'd really recommend something else if u don't have Facebook,
Good app. But it won't let me upload my picture for my profile. I don't know why. All it says is failed to upload photo. Very annoying.,
Not working! I cannot log my daughter in on this app. I enter my information and it keeps going back to that screen.,
REMOVE DISCONNECTING IT IS VERY SILLY,
"Great to connect kids, if you allow only kidsyouse it and monitor it as a parent it is perfect. I like the weekly updates",
Good for kids to communicate but not so easy to use. Wish you could see your kids' texts from the parent portal but you cannot,
Cannot authorize ANY device I try. Loops nonstop wanting my email & password. My kid is locked out of his account because of it. I couldn't be more frustrated.,
Every time I try opening the app it exits out of it right away. I even deleted it and reinstalled it and it still doesn't work.,
I love being able to see (and be in control of) my daughter's activity using kids messenger. It's easy to use and the app keeps me informed.,
"Great, feel like kids are safe in here, but seems a bit limited. Can't emoji react, can't change themes or send pics/memes to each other. We get why pics are prohibited, but the rest seems unnecessary.",
great app. I do wish it had chat bubbles and notifications. my kids use it to keep in touch with their grandparents in Texas.,
I am facing problems to create this after all the process done then see that something went wrong when we r creating yours kids profile..try again...I'll try more than 20 times but failed...pls help to create account....,
"Having trouble with this, can communicate with grandson, but not with granddaughter. Tried to load without being a parent and cant get it to work.",
A great tool to keep kids connected at this time. I heard concerns about information collection but haven't dug into it.,
Good app my kid loves playing this!but I have to give it four stars because it won't show her face if you call and it won't let her play games.please fix.,
"A couple weeks ago I would've given this app 5 stars, but the new update annoys me. It isn't as fun anymore, and I can't play games. I really wish that it would go back to normal.",
It's really good the only thing that i don't like is that you have to have facebook to get this app to work. Otherwise it's Awsome.,
I love the parent controls. and you can see what your kid(s) are doing. Also everything is sent to your parents phone.,
good at first(for like about a month or two) then it wouldnt let me enter. it would turn white for like a second then went to my home screen.,
Messenger kids is one of the funnest ways to talk to your friends or just to talk to your parents in messenger kids there are also lots of games you can play solo games multiplayer games but one of the funnest part about it is because it's kind of like Snapchat or stuff like that in calls you get to play games and calls click on these icons on the bottom and it's and it makes you like you different things sometimes it's sweet sometimes it's scary but no matter what it's amazing üòéüòúüòéüòúüòéüòúüòéüòú,
Fix the log in issue and I'll change my review. It shouldn't take this long to fix this issue! It hasn't let me log in for almost a week now!,
every time I go on it my screen goes black and it sometimes logs me out so tonight I'm trying to log back in and it keeps saying is wrong so I hate it.,
"Ok so basicly/I'm a kid btw/, I had a different phone where I had friends added on it but there is no login button and when I put in my moms email it doesnt work, so basicly I cant chat with my friends that I have on there.",
great app two things children should be able to up load photos for their icon pictures and you should be able to edit names of contacts like for example changing my name to mommy and my sister's name to auntie,
"very new to it as my son is still young, but it is interesting as far as the drawing guess game between contacts.",
Good app. Usefull for friends who don't have a normal message app. Only complaint is that you can't share links.,
Have tried from several devices to use the app to create an account for my daughter so she can talk to her grandmother and it gives me errors every time.,
I like it but thare is one thing u could fix on it and the thing is that every time the friends that u have on it are online when they really aren't online so that is something you could fix,
"Originally a 1 star. Now it actually lets me log in, and once you actually get to log in, it is a pretty good app overall.",
This app has great range and is very fun and I would recommend it any day. so stop reading and start downloading it.,
pretty cool. i love the interactive games . covid has been hard but this has been a blessing . and its free !!!!,
Fun the only thing is that kids can't delete their own texts and you cannot use pictures that you already have on your phone you have to take a new picture,
Good concept but I cant hear anyone shes calling on our fire tablet. All other media is loud but I have to hold the tablet up to our face to hear the person on the other end,
"Amazing and ad free, My child loves calling his friends. It takes a while to get used to though but it's fine!",
"I keep getting error messages when trying to load this app for my son. I've tried three different devices so far, none have worked. Is there a solution for this?",
Excellent for texting kids. Awesome games but sometimes glitchy. I really do consider it while this period (COVID-19\ Coronavirus).üòãüòã,
"I would like to be able to designate my wife and I as the admins of our family group (which includes our little ones registered through our Facebook accounts). I think we should be able to share GIFs and photos with each other in our family chat as long as the admins allow it. Default settings should be disallow, but first shared image or GIF should direct the user to contact the parent or admin to allow sharing.",
I like that if they don't hv a phone number they can just search up their friend's name or look up their code. And font apps work on it,
I had it before when I sign in it only lets me create not text Wich sucks üòî I'm downloading it again hope it works(edit) nope it's staying at one until you fix it,
10/10 would recommend. It has little mini games that are super fun. Download it and you won't be disappointed,
I love this app but sometimes when you're making videos and you turn the camera around it glitches on you so yeah that's the only reason why it's bad but everything else is good and I love calling my cousin on messenger,
App wont work on android. Downloaded IOS and it let me log in right away. The droid app doesn't acknowledge any Facebook email or phone numbers.,
Best app ever! I use it to keep in touch with friends and family... Plus you can play games!! However it is not an offline game,
Same experience as other users. Cannot authorize device. This app gives you the worst Groundhog Day experience an app could provide. Zero stars.,
I love this app I can message my girl scout friend I have no issues with this app I love it so far keep up the good work it's a really good app to use and it's very very very very useful!‚ô°,
"This app is very good to me because it is safe and family friendly, I would recommend this app for kids to have a safe and kind conversation!",
This app is great but it kicked my daughter out and it expects me to make her a new account she has lost contact with a couple friends across country because of this so problem..,
"I love this app , would recommend to anyone with young kids , only issue I have had is unless I download data , it wont let me click/poke the charts and read em .",
"I LIKE THIS SO MUCH but one problem, I drawed all 3 pictures and then I clicked the draw button again all of them aren't in the chat! Please fix it",
"When I tried signing up for my child,it wouldn't work,I would uninstall it and reinstall to try again to just have it not work,other than that I know its safe for kids",
This app is good. But it needs more filters. And it doesn't share links which is annoying. Otherwise we like it. üòõ,
When I try to make a account it says there's a error and I keep waiting and reinstalling the app but it still says the same thing üò£üò£ please FIX!!!!!,
this app is really good for people who dont have facetime that have people they know is far away and cant make any contact with them it is amazing and i think more people should dowload it :D,
Useless app... My son gets friend request that I can't accept as I can't see the parent (and it is a mandatory step). Parent is already a friend in my Facebook.,
1 EVERY TIME I WRITE MY PASSWORD IT SAIDS ITS NOT FOUND AND IT SHOULD BE ITS ARE REAL PASSWORD,
It's not letting me create an account it's like PLS TRY AGAIN,
Cool app. But why I gave it 4 stars is because it should at least have no wifi. The actual messenger has that feature. So please add in no wifi. Thanks,
It's the perfect way to chat with friends if you're far away if you guys live for from each other it the perfect way to play games with your friends,
It does not suport anything. I cant send link for anything. I have bitmoji but cant send them it is anoying. Please fix it.,
It's good and safe.,
Amazing Perfect love it,
I love this app so much üòÑüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüñïüèΩüñïüèΩüñïüèΩüñïüñïüñï,
App downloaded on my son's new device but won't let me login. Keeps booting me back to authorization page. VERY frustrated by this.,
"It wouldn't even let me create a account even tho I was putting in everything right so annoying I even got my dad to help and he unstalled the app and tried again please fix this,Its Annoying",
Good for kids,
You have to re-login everytime you uninstall app it's sad bro since I cant use that account with my child but it was amazing tho I needed a little help from the one and only hair salon master CHEF (ur mom) and my friend so they will hopefully help me soon enough bc I need them to clean my sink,
Great EXCEPT you can't ACTUALLY delete what your kid sends. It deletes it for them only but not who they sent it to. Heaven forbid they send a nude or something. This is a major flaw.,
"It's a great app but for some reason it automatically added this oerson ""Clara Phillips"" and now I can't seem to figure out how to unfriend this stranger.",
"It worked fine but now when I try to open it, it kicks off again and won't open. I did notice that it got a new update. Could this be the issue? Please help",
"This is a great app to keep in touch with my grandkids. Due to cover I haven't been able to see them in person, this really helps a grandma who is missing the grandkids.",
"This app is amazing but they got rid of all the decent filters nearly cried when I saw hope they bring them back, and also annoying how parents can see EVERYTHING.",
"Haven't been April to have my grandson try to use this, as the languages in a different language than English and we can't maneuver through it.",
"I can't send any of my videos or photos anymore üò≠. Can u please fix this? But otherwise the app is great, Thank you.",
"Never made it past ""authentication "" - frustrated to not be able to utilize this tool for my mini. Social distancing is hard and this would've been a great resource ...",
"Cannot authorize in Samsung s9. Was working fine on iPhone. Please fix this issue, cannot use this app anymore!",
This is an awesom app but I gave it four stars because there can be lots of bugs. Other than that I reccomend downloading it.,
Ok this app is amazing but the thing that is really bad at a specific time it sez unable to send for a long period idk if it's a glitch but can you ples fix,
"So I have only 2 problems , 1:I can't see when a person text me , and 2: I can't open the app for 2 days straight and I still can't please fix this!",
The app over all of a good app but the only thing I would change is I want to be able to see the time the text came in but you can't tell,
unable to view child's chats in my account. not really full of parental controls. app fails to send or receive messages for days,
"Great way to keep in contact with grandkids during this pandemic. I feel better now that I can see & talk to them. Makes ""Stay at Home"" feel bearable.",
"I really like the features and stuff but I would recommend new gifs, Fonts Yeah!. But besides that I love it !!!",
"I use this app to keep in touch with my friends, but I never get notifications so they think I ignore them. Please fix this Facebook.",
"Great app great for kids I loves it, it has games on it too, don't worry about that there kid game things really fun ones too please get it if your kids want to have a messenger",
I think it is a great app it helps you chat with friends and family. You get different effects and lots of other great things!,
"Mic not working on video calls, did Factory reset 2x and removed reinstalled, still not working: Samsung Tablet A. Please fix!",
"Can anyone tell me why I can't log into my child's existing account on a new device?? It either tries to make me create a new account or says""failed to find accounts"" My kids have had these accounts for forever and were logged on to 2 devices, do we really need to start again??",
I love it I can call my friends my family on it I love this app in my whole life no one can have the nicest app even a kid can have it and it'll love it parents download this for your kids please and thank you you can download anybody but you have to put their things on it you can send like cool things you can add people to it it's really cool and awesome for a little kids and me I'm six years old I mean seven love you all and I hope you have a nice day,
It's good but I think you should add 3 shots in the middle to look like it's calling or connecting to the other person I'm trying to video chat with,
I'm stuck in a loop for log in information no where to ask for help. Got my kids new devices trying to put it on driving me mad when will this be fixed.,
I doesnt liad at all if I want to text someone I have to do it on a different app because this one doesnt work make it load or I'll never use it again.,
It's good when it works but the camera quits working from time to time and it has to be uninstalled and reinstalled.,
"BEWARE! We just witnessed one of our children receive a call from their sibling.. While they were both away from their devices and sitting at the table. That is downright creepy and potentially unsafe! Also, they are only logged in on ONE device each and the devices were charging next to each other.",
"Overall a pretty good app, but for some reason my messages will only send when I send 1 or 2 more messages. Is this a glitch?",
My kids are young and love being able to call their grandparents and cousins. We love this app. The only drawback is they call them multiple times in a row when they don't answer. That's not ok.,
App not ln sleep mode but it wont send or recieve messages. It keeps saying in sleep mode. I have even fully disabled the option and it still wont work,
Because of this app my kids are able.to keep in contact with friends that have moved away. this app is amazing!,
When I got the app in had it for months and than one day all the sudden it said your app went asleep and j tried fixing it but noth in ng happened otherwise everything is fine but please fix this,
its okay...there's a lot of glitches. the video chat doesnt work. and it freezes up a lot.,
It is a great app for younger kids. You can text and face time your friends or family on this app.,
The app isn't working! Seems to be a widespread problem with logging in and authorizing devices!,
It's ok but when I try to call they never send and I have type and send a text for a call to send and everytime I get called by somebody it gets blurry,
I didn't even get to use the app..when I was signing in it kept saying that it was having a problem signing me in and to try again later and I kept on trying to sign in and it still didn't work!üò≠üò°,
Text your friends and family. This app is easy to use and it's very nicely made. You can play games on messenger kids too!,
This app is the best I can talk to any body! (Except for my school friends) but you creators can maybe add that as a update.,
"Amazing app I thought I should get messenger but I cant because then I didn't have a phone number now 4 years late still using it perfect app for kids love it, that's why I will give it 100 stars if I could",
Awesome app to chat on. My only complaint is that it lags and glitches very often. Great app though.,
Over all it is a good app but I wish it would tell my child when her friends text her it doesn't always notify her of her friends messages,
I love this bc I can call my cousins and family BTW there is no adds,
"ALWAYS when my son sends a message, it says sleep mode even though he can't be on the app when it's in sleep mode and he's on it. Please fix this issue!",
Won't work POS!!!! Tried logging in many times and kept going back to log in. Pissing me off! Has a bug and needs fixing!,
"Hi, i love the app but i think its spying on you because in many games you have to show your face, other than that i love it, thanks!!",
Love how my kids can use this app to communicate with us if we are at work. And very nice that we get to see who they are talking to and what pictures they're sending..thank you,
Agree with other low reviews! This app sucks!! It won't let me login. This is true on multiple devices. Fix the problem!!!,
I used to love kids messenger because ot used to be fun and the layout was cool but know its boring and my favrite part was you could change the color of the messages but i cant do that any more i miss the old kids messenger,
"It works very well üòä. When I go on vacation and my kids want to see me, I looked for a messenger for kids. And I saw this so I downloaded it, and I tried it. And what do you know it works!!!!! Me and my kids love this app. Please download this app!!! üëçüëçüëçüëçüôÇüôÇüôÇüòÅüòÅüòÅ",
I love communicating with my kids in this app and I like the idea that they can text and talk to the family and being able to see who are they talking too. üôÇ,
I entered my password then it took me back to email. but it just started to work again so I still like the app but it has lots of problems.,
I love the app but it is telling me to update it but it works on my other devices but it will not work on this one very frustrating pls fix.,
I think it's a fun game because you can do filters during calls and like take pictures and near every holiday there's a new filter of you new filters.,
"I have followed all the instructions, gets me all the way to download point and never starts to download. Fed up with trying for get this app.",
Love the messenger kids app. My daughter can video chat me and all her cousins when ever she wants! it's completely free and it keeps them off my phone I love it lol,
ùñ®ùóç ùóÇùóå ùóåùóà ùóÄùóàùóàùñΩ ùñªùóéùóç ùóÇùóç ùóÇùóå kinda ùóÖaggy,
"This app is amazing, but one problem. On both my Lenovo and my Samsung, it doesn't give me the update to turn off my camera! Please fix.",
upon opening the app to set up my sons account it wont recognize my Facebook account. I've put in all the valid emails and numbers and still nothing!,
There are so many glitches. First it wouldn't let me authorize a device for days. Then finally when I was able to it won't let me add contacts for my child.,
"It's a good app but people send stuff to me like if you dont send this message to 15 people you will turn ugly in 1 year, so if you ever get something like that just ignore it.",
I love this app its absolutely extrodinary but the only bad thing is that if you don't use it for a few days you have to sign in again but i use it everyday so it a good app i really receamend this app,
I keeps saying that I'm not connected and I checked it like 5 times it gives problems on calls it goes super slow and sound weird #stay safe in covid-19,
My kids love this app than are all way on it and it help them a lot.how then can talk to there frirnd and famly.üòÅ eventhowny my oldest brek her back at 5 she can still talk to people!!!!‚ò∫,
I am having the same frustrations as listed below. I cannot get the app to verify on my son's device no matter how many times I enter my FB information and password! Can someone please help us parents out??,
"Works well for my child on his iPad, but when I get the parent report in Facebook Messenger on my android phone it crashes the app, every single time.",
I and my grandson have a blast with this app. We really do alot of laughing at each other and ourselves using the effects on it.,
"sadly, i accidentally deleted it on my tablet. and i had to install a similar app, because there was no other way to fix it, it was awful. (it doesn't mean i hate the app somehow) the app is great,",
Nice and think isee it about chatting in other friends my son .4,
"Please fix the logging in issue! I can't get back in. Also, is there no way to delete a text from my child's messenger? I know to delete pictures, but I want a text option.",
This app won't even let me create an account. Even after parent account is made. Just keeps saying can't do it atm and to try later. ?????,
Its a good app but the promble with it is that their is login and signing up plz change the login and signing . if u do that this app will be the best . thanks for changing it,
I love this app I can see what my child is doing and who she talks with or calls. It asks for my approval first before she can add contacts on messenger.,
Easy-to-use..,
"I love this app, but can you add cuter fliters? And more please. Most of the cute filters get removed and replaced =(",
It won't work now and keeps saying the app is asleep. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ And it won't let me add my husband to my kids contacts. It sucks now.,
Such an easy simple app for children to use. Our 11 year old uses it a lot. And it is very safe for parents to monitor their child's activity,
Hasn't been working right since the last update. Pictures posted keep disappearing.,
I love this app because i can keep in touch with my friends and i can us the little face stickers and it also tells you if your friends are online so you dont acidentaly disturb them,
"If you sign out, you can't sign back in, the app is terrible, dark mode should also be implemented.",
My son is really super excited now that he can call his brothers and friends. Very good üëç great app for kids to get to know Facebook.,
"Other than the fact that if you have an android you cant change your profile pic and i CANT change the ""favorite color"" its a good app.",
"This is amazing, and it doesn't let you say mean words or mean emojis. I have lots of friends on this app!",
Good for kids to Chat with family and friends and have fun on calls to have a fun times and I reccon its it has a great express around the world,
Keeps my son in contact with his grandparents. We love it. He is 4 so he only sends silly pictures and videos.,
"Installed on son's chromebook. Won't open on chromebook. Highly disappointed. If it's not a chromebook app, get it out of the chromebook store.",
"Love this app, now my kids too experience talking and communicate with his long distance cousin. He's so happy he gets to text, voice chat with long distance relatives.",
I love the app because I can keep in contact with all my family and I could do all sorts of things and it's kind of like Snapchat you have lots of filters,
Please make this available for PC. The kindle app is glitchy and logs the kids out constantly which when you're away from them makes it difficult to get them logged back in.,
It is great i love it very safe and efficient good way to socialize during these intense lockdowns i think kids should have to ask to block people but anyway its very good,
My son is 5 and this is perfect for him. Fun picture filters to choose from and the parental settings are great,
I enjoy that this app is as secure as it is. I can allow or not allow someone to be able to talk to my kids. They also have fun with it. Thank you!,
Love being able to interact and/or monitor my kid's conversations. Great app for young ones.,
I love this app it is so safe for kids so they dont have to be on your phone calling or texting there friend it is safe and fun !!!!!,
"It's a good app but, Its hard to get people to message you and most of the time the message show that it hasn't been delivered.",
I love this app but the thing is I want more colors to decorate the app. I want colors like black etc. That is why I give it 4 stars.,
My kids love it and the always chat with their friends ‚ò∫Ô∏èü•∞and just to me it feels like they make more plans with it other than real life so yeah I recommend getting it,
It's awesome and great for kids plus I think that the stuff that you can make on your screen is awesome for kids they really like it,
I love it it keeps me in contact with my pride and joy and my only grandchild and my only daughter and son-in-law who live in Kentucky and I miss them so much. And this app. Really helps so thanks again.,
"I love messager kids it has no adds duh , but it I gave a 4/5 because it has glitches I could have given it a 5 so try it out NOW also when I try to do this :) it turns into his üôÇ like wth",
"Good. The quality of this app has been incredible, I have been easily logged in and its been an fun experience.",
It is amazing I use it a lot because all of my friends dont have actual numbers so we talk on there all the time and it is really great,
Trying to set up my child's account and it will not let me log in. Very frustrating. Won't work on my phone or her device.,
"It tells you to download every time you try to use it. After 3 weeks of trying to make it work, I'm exhausted! Great idea, but they need to fix the app . I give it a 0.",
I cannot create an account. I've tried reading the forums but got no help. Tried reaching out got no help. All it says is account can't be created. Doesn't say why or how to fix it.,
Great way for kids to keep in contact with there friends and the way it is set up to where no one can be added till an adult adds them.,
"It's great for my kids. I have 7 kids and they walk home on their own. My oldest unlocks the door and comes in. my husband is a doctor and I have a office job, so that means me and my husband are usually home late. But with this app they can just face time me until I get home.",
This good and all but something is wrong with my notification every time Mom text me there's no pop-up screen on the top of the phone can you fix it becaues mom is mad at me,
"This app is great but I am unable to view my parent dashboard? The main game, as well is literal garbage. Needs updated. No likey.",
the app updated and now it doesn't work. I use it to communicate with my kids so after this is fixed I can then give more srars,
this thing takes to long to send the message and even if my freaking friend is online playing on their phone or tablet it won't send and even if they are online in messenger this sucks. it would take a month before it sends the message,
it is a terible app never ever get this app it is the worst app in the world. It is really bad because it makes this wind noise. And it wont even show youre face.,
i love that i van access it at anytime and ot has features that allow my children to call or video chat with me. i do wish i could add other people that isnt on my Facebook though,
"The app is really good, but I would like if it has dark mode like Messenger. Good for talking to people without numbers!",
It's great and all but I think personally there should be a call and video call not just video call,
The app locked my kid out and I can't get her back in. I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it but that didn't work.,
Can't even make an account for the app when I get to the create account section. If it doesn't get fixed this is never going to work,
Really smart idea .. love how I can monitor the kids ...I'd like it if it was a bit easier to use as in adding friends and what not,
I only give it three stars because it won't let you erase the sentence if it has a swear word or something in it accidentally l accidentally put a swear word in it and it won't let me erase it so I don't like it that much,
I really love this app! I can text my familys and friends and its super safe for kids or anyone to use this app and my mom and dad and sister has messenger i do not but its ok because it can let me call and text anyone as long as a as my mom is pormision,
It's a good app to talk with my friends but one problem is that after the time when it wakes up it will say come back when your app wakes up,
I love it. Every time I need to make friends they have the app! Highly recommend this app for your kids!!,
Same as pretty much all the other reviews. Can't get past the login page. Screw Mark Zuckerberg. I mean really. Dude thinks BBQ sauce is decoration.,
Love it I use it to talk to my family and friends I don't get to see although I would really appreciate it if we could change the names for our contacts on here,
It's a good app until they update policy and you have to agree to it because it won't let me hit the I agree button so the parental dashboard is limited,
It's so amazing my kid loves it .I have to approve everyone my kid wants to add and super appropriate. Thank you for this app my kid can now text safely but still have fun ! üòÄüòÉüòÄüòÉüòÄüòÉ,
Although it's a good app it said the message sent but it says that it did not deliver and when I try to text him I type one letter and it doesn't register that I typed anything so plz either update it or just fix it plz,
This is the best you should get this because it gives you games and grow youre own pet. It evens let you do vidios and download them and post them to youre friends. You can just type in youre friends zip code and you can get them on youre friends really fast,
"Sooo.... When I was going on kids messenger, my pet just.. disappeared. Like, the button for going to raise your ot disappeared.. other than that, it's a great app.",
i think it is amazing because it is amazing for kids and when they are bored and done with school work they can taalk to there friends and have fun,
This is perfect for my child! Whenever my child doesn't feel safe she can easily report and let adults know about it.,
Hate the update... now mine doesn't look anything like my childs does. I tried to uninstall the update with no luck. Please fix it back. Thanks,
was great until it crashed today...click the app opens white then closes a second later...is this being corrected? I downloaded it on a newer tablet. same issue.,
"App doesn't work. States an error has occurred when my friend (a parent) tries to approve me to chat with her child. They have Apple, I am Android... Maybe that's the problem?",
I like it but when I try to send a gif from YouTube or something like pusheen cat it keeps on thinking its inappropriate and then I cant send ._. Pls fix this asap,
This app worked fine on my iPhone. Was a great thing for kids but for a new Android and the Android version won't let me log in.,
"If you don't have text of call, then this would be perfect for you ! It is kid friendly and there is no inappropriate things of harmful things!!!",
Will not let me log in since the last update. I reinstalled and clear cache and data. I don't know why it won't let me log in on my phone.,
I like how I can choose who she talks to my daughter loves us she loves it too much she probably annoys a lot of people but I only made certain people or friends so people that I don't mind being annoyed by her LOL,
Ran into an issue last week where I had to relocate my kid again and nothing was working until I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. No further assistance was required,
I love it I can talk to my friends and if I have any questions it will tell me an error and tell me what to do and it will also allow me to text call but I wish I could also talk like ear to ear not just face to face,
Okay there seems to be a glitch i try to call but it it says connecting but at the top at the blue thing it says calling please fix this it really makes it confusing if actually your calling the person or not,
"My Kids love this and its great that they cannot delete a conversation however....WARNING! if the child leaves a friend group, you can no longer see the chat. This is dangerous! My daughter left a chat group with her friends as it got a little weird but she couldnt show it to me as it was no longer available to be seen. This means kids can make a friend group, be nasty then leave the group and the parent of the nasty kid would be none the wiser. Just wanted to warn parents of this.",
"there needs to be a parent control panel. the only way I can manage is to log in to her account, which is fine, but it's not user friendly this way. üôÑ",
hey this s you is an amazing app you can do different things on it and one thing you can do is do something like sapchat and make different faces. It is an amazing app download it now. PLEASE,
My kids can connect with all their school friends. Easy to use. Fun filters & games. So far so good.,
I would totally recommend this app there was never any problems for it being slow sometimes but that was only because I was at somebody else's house,
Can't sign into my son's account ever. This app was good for awhile. Now it's just annoying and completely dysfunctional.,
"It allows me to talk to my friends when I never could and now I can, so that's pretty much all can say, also it is really safe and I would recommend it to all kids",
"After I download the app on my son phone, the problem come in at when I try to log in. It keeps on going back to Login where you put your email in..",
"This is absolute garbage. The ONLY WAY for me to approve contacts for my kid is on the Facebook app, not on desktop or Messager. This makes no sense. I DO NOT WANT FACEBOOK.",
"it's been a lot of fun using this app, my daughter loves it! i feel comfortable letting her talk to her Nana, myself, her father, and her Grandpa.",
great but hard to install on chrome book its great for kids maybe 6 + kids must have code of freinds to get them as a contact if i could it would be a 4.5 so its pretty good,
It wont let me make the account. It says it has an error and I would really lobe to use this on my 5 years because it sounds safe.,
This app is so awesome for kids I can text my cousin Shannelle everytime I want to it's just an amazing app for kids like I can't stop texting my cousin she's the best always she also plays roblox like I do much but she doesn't play roblox much so that's why I gave it five stars and thank you for making this app!,
Have been able to log in and then all of a sudden this week can't log in won't let me see what is going on.. you need to fix this issue immediately ...,
I really like this app cuz I can chat with my friends and FaceTime them cuz most of my friends don't have accounts that I have example Instagram I can text three of my friends on that but I can't text the rest of them on it cuz they don't have Instagram but I love messenger kids and I suggest getting it,
"Love It. it works like a normal messaging app its really cool. I use it to call my dad, and game with friends. And if your bored theres all these multiplayer games that you can play. Messenger kids is really fun DOWNLOAD NOW!",
this app sucks. Everything you Find on Normal messager is Junk. If you want to message your Kid TEAMSPEAK (Old af program that sucks) Is better then This. If you need A good messaging app Try Anything Else.,
When I downloaded the app and after I put in the details. I clicked create account and it said there was a problem creating my account,
"I have been trying to create an account for my son and I keep getting the same error message. Too much effort to connect, I will just find another app",
App keeps crashing. Won't let me open it. Unistalled and reinstalled and it didn't help.,
This is great except there is no dark mode and there should be more color options 4 stars and the updates I can't get them to show up,
"Its fine but a question that I have is that why facebook? what if you dont have facebook? and their explanation is ""so we can confirm that you are an adult"" like what 6 or 7 year old is going to do this sneak onto their parents phone and put in their email (if they even know it)to talk to a freind like what?",
"Please bring back the pufferfish filteeerrrrr, plleeeeaaaassseee!! üê°üê°üê°üê°üê°üê°üê°üê°‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",
I love this app!,
I have been trying to make my child an account for over an hour. I was able to make his name but it won't show an account under my parental dashboard. Please help and or fix this issue! Please and thank you!,
It was working great. My kids and I were really enjoying using it and now it's not working at all... very disappointed. I hope this gets fixed quickly.,
I love how I can get updates on who my daughter is talking & texting with. I also love the feature where I can see what pictures she is sending & receiving.,
I r great but I did nothing to It and it said unable to send I hate that I love this app but fix that problem or I am not using this app ok plus I have been good on this app I use it all the time so fix the bugs please ü•∫ hope you had a better experience than me,
"It will not allow me to create an account for my granddaughter, she has 2 previous accounts that are old and I wanted to create a new one for her, but it keeps saying, ""something went wrong!""",
my daughter absolutely loves this app I think I could be a lot better though I think you could have a lot more fun things for her for kids to do,
thanks !!! this app allows IT growth for my child. He is two anf understands how to answer and hang up . His mother said he also knows how to call you back. Its amazing.,
"I love this app. When I just started, witch was less than a year ago, there was a bunch of people that I knew and had no idea they were on. I really recommend that you get this app if you are a kid.",
"I keep getting the message ""REST API is deprecated for versions v2.1 and higher"" and it won't allow my kids to log in on their tablets or my S9+?!",
I like this app but sometimes the app just logs you out of your account and I am just to get back in so can you please make were the app do not log you out unless you push the log out button.,
"Can't log on ""failure to create account"". Tried everything and facebook has been absolutely no help. Very unfortunate",
It's straight to the point you talk to ur friends and you can play games with it....but I wish you could use ur Bitmojis with it because it feels like I have a Bitmoji for nothing,
"pretty good, wish I could share photos and vids with my own daughter..but it's a perfect way to communicate with your children",
This game is ausome you can speak with tons of your friends and call if u need to now there is only one thing about this up it uses a LOT of storage like if I want to take photos it only lets me take a couple because I have no storage and you can make group chats and have a group chat so other then that this game is the best game for kids so if u need a calling app for your kids I suggest this app,
everysinge time me and my friends always play and when we turn off our camra we can not hear each other and we have to to go back to the call and call and and u know i play roblox duh and we have to call back and it sucks so yeah,
"I tried to get my grandson a phone, but he would misplace it or not charge it since he was on his tablet more then his phone, so we started using this app and we love it!",
This app is very good I got this app to keep in contact with my friends and family my mom let me get this app in the middle of quarantine because I can't see my friends or fam you should definitely get this app!!!!,
"Description says ""Works on all tablets and smartphone"". Try to install it on a 2 year old tablet: ""Not compatible with your device.""",
So I have a friend she lives far from me. So I got this app maybe I could talk to her all the time then but it glitches a lot so we just end the call.,
Great app with wonderful parental controls to keep the kids as safe as possible while keeping friends close.,
"I love having this app to stay in toych with my son, and that it gives him the ability to have contact with his friends, and other family members, as well...",
I love it. If I did not have this app I would not be able to be in contact with my bestie she goes out of town for 6 weeks every year so I love it,
I purposely downloaded this for my daughter Kate but it turned out to be awesome like so brilliant.My daughter was so happy when she saw this app.I recommend that every parent should download this for their kids.üëçüëçüëç,
Great app but need to be able to delete messages and add parent. App stopped allowing child to text parent and am unable to add parent.,
I would like to say that this game is HUGE thumbs up! but it takes away all your space on whatever phone tablet computer but I do recomend it also I don't recoment it.,
Downloaded for my kids to give them the opportunity to communicate with family overseas whenever they want. While I liked the control I have it doesn't work any more for our European contacts and now I have an unhappy kid that keeps asking for my device.,
Having issues retrieving my daughter's account. Can't even get a new account after having dinner a manual hard reset on her tablet. Very upset and disgruntled.,
Have more problems than message time,
"No conversations are coming up in the inbox when I open the app, everything is white so I can't see anything or talk to anyone",
Can't even make an acc jeez,
You can do so many things went so good when you get kind of bored but so so fun and I like it alot I text my friends and my cousins and it's really really really fun,
"This app is great but, when I call someone it never calls just says connecting. Then when someone calls me, it works",
Having trouble creating account. Account creation failure keeps coming out. Sent an email still waiting on a response. üòë,
Honestly I like this app because I get to talk with school friends but whenever I play with a friend and call them there screen transfer black and I think we should customize our ringtone when people call us,
my kids have used it for a few weeks now. I haven't had any problems. It's nice that they can communicate with their friend. I would like a way to check all of their messages from my phone.,
Good idea for kids because in my opinion kids 13 and under doesn't need a Facebook..but this allows kids to have a way to keep in contact with friends and family who does have there own phones yet or actual FB yet,
Love it!!! However it could really use the option to change the names like a nickname option.,
Keep asking for password. Same issue that others are having..I can't login on my son's tablet..it keeps asking me for password..i tried the other way still the same. I gave up,
I don't really like the app cuz when you're trying to call somebody and they try to answer won't let them so it'll say they're offline and it'll be really bad and you can't delete even if people just add you for some kind of reason people which is really bad,
I love this app except for the cutting out. In the middle of a call it would cut out so we could not talk anymore,
"Perfect for my kids to talk to their grandparents and friends. I can always see who they talk to. Lots of privacy, lots of control.",
"It's a good app and I definitely recommend it for your kid. It's safe, it has games, and you can contact your kid anytime",
"I love this app!! I love talking to my friends who can't have other apps like Snapchat,insta and etc. Definitely recommend.",
"i like it. except, my daughters dad and i arent facebook friends, and we both want to manage her account. not possible. i tried al ways...",
Everytime I try to update my favorite color it says failed to update color and I can't choose a photo from my gallery to be my profile picture I have to take a new picture please fix this :(,
"Really disappointed with the last update. My son can't log into his account most of the time, and even when he can, he still can't send or receive anything.",
"This app sucks, you cant video chat, it glitches when you try, they never have any good filters, when they do its only for a day, it just sucks",
it's way safer than the regular messaging but sometimes when I go to change my picture it logs me out and makes me start all over again,
"I love the app but the people who created it, can you red this please, all of my friends have a gallery option when it comes to editing their picture and I don't. Is there something wrong with my app?",
This is a nice app! But would be nice if you let me add an account from facebook thats already been created so my progress in messenger would be added here cause i Just found out about it thank you.,
"Waste of time! For an app for kids, its beyond frustrating and too many glitches for it to be even worth it.",
"Great app, great keep connected great way to video messenger your kid. Excellent way to monitor your kids and their contacts.",
Not sure why people are giving it a 4 but its amazing def recommend except your friends have to be friends with your friends to make a group like I have 2 friends that want to talk but with me too and you wanna make a group but those friends need to be friends please make it so that I can make a group with all of my friends even when they aren't all friends,
"Great for kids and being able to monitor messages, only real complaint is the app adds myself as a friend and keeps notifying me about myself üòí definitely annoying",
sometimes it doesn't work like when people change the pictures I don't get to see the new pictures great app communicate üòÜwith your friend,
I love you're at so much I can't get it that's the one reason that's why I only put put 1 2 3 4 4 stickersso you need to make like the parents like make them like it and like make them like have let their child's have it and and make them go into it like like if it's impropia like they don't know if it's inappropriate likeparents think that the game is not inappropriate and your archip children can have it I love it but I can't have it that's why I only booked one two three four tha.,
It was a pretty decent app until recently. It has stopped authentication on our android. I can only get into the app on my iphone by going in directly from facebook.,
Parents arent able to delete anything from the parent side of the app. This should be something we can do. also the parents cant view the conversations unless they install kids messenger.,
I don't like anybody says they hate it it's good it's more saferand I don't like that nobody says it I hate it cuz it's super good for your kidsI have a kid and she really likes ipas so much people she's really enjoying itso I can free breakfast out instead of regular messenger for your kidsand if you have messenger right now for your kids get off get Messengers kids. ü¶ãü¶ëüêæüï∑Ô∏è,
so far i like it other ther video filters need lots of work. and they need to make games so they can play .,
this app is difficult to manage as a parent. it will not connect to my messengdr account so i can add family members for my son to chat with. very frustrating,
Love the amount of control I have! Excellent app. I just wish it was easier to find my sons friends.,
This is literally the best messaging app I've ever had. Especially because I haven't been able to see my friends and I just absolutely love it! I highly recommend this app!!üòÅ,
Amazing! Because during Covid 19 I can't talk to my friends at all. But this app really helped me chat with my friends!,
I love this app u can mesige your friends during covid. and u can messige ur friends all away acrost the world. Hope u like it. I rate it five stars!!!,
My kid can now call my friends and their kids without stealing my phone so big plus. Also she blows my phone up making it hard for me to meme so hard negative. All in all though im happy with it.,
Super good but it would be SUPER nice if the could let you use it on laptop well I mean FaceBook never looks at these so what is the point of writing this,
I downloaded this app so my son can talk to his dad and his aunt when I'm at work. But it's not allowing me to create one for him. What's the point if it keeps popping up as an error.,
"Ive had the app for two or three years and its been fine, but during calls its a little glitchy, but other than that its a giid app.",
I am a kid and I love it I can contact my mom and my brother I love all of the games and filters because they are funny and awesome hope everybody else that has kids gets this app for them!!,
The app won't let me watch any videos from friends I'm connected to. Can't get any support from developer,
I did enjoy this app i was able to text my cousin's and friends had loke no probles but one where i could not get a freind added but other than that it was very good,
"i love the safety features, and its a great idea that should keep improving. i wanna get my kid her own phone so this is a perfect way to start",
"The app fails to login although I logged in with my account and I tried the one time password as well ,I tried many times and my kid is frustrated üò†",
Its ok I love this app but....i do not like the fact that it cuts off calls after a while! Also i hate how they assume emojis like i put :p it putsüòõ or üòù!!! Plz change this,
Very nice very much easier than it should work for new version of the app is free and open source and open source and open to be involved No interest rate,
This is a great app to text people and stuff but sometimes it gets glitchy stops working but you can still make it work so yeah this is a good app.,
"So far I have liked it and like how I can monitor my child's conversations if need be, but feel it is a safe alternative to the regular fb.",
It wont allow me to log into the app after i enter my password it just says logged out i tried doing it a bunch of different ways and nothing seems to work,
"Why is my daughter not receiving notifications when someone has messaged her? Yes, we do have the notifications button enabled",
Keeps booting out of the app and doesn't seem to run well as I need I have used it for contact with my child regarding some more absence than presence in their lives.,
When my child calls me it echoes and its really loud and I have to really listen just to hear them other than that it's a good app where I can message my son,
It's a good app but when I try to log in with an email or phone number it comes up with a random person i dont know as my parent.,
My kids enjoy talking with their friends on this app. I love the activities that they do on there and I am just so amazed and so pleased with this app,
"I love the app. Gives kids some of the experience but not much exposure to bigger live videos for kids who have their own upcoming businesses, etc. Overall 5 star! Thanks Facebook.",
Just like the regular messenger just better and I think it's awesome for ppl that have family and friends spread across the world.,
App doesn't work. Won't accept Facebook password even after I try resetting the password or using a one time code. Simply unusable,
"It is a very good app for kids to talk to there friends. You can video chat, send pictures, and send videos.",
It is very good for me and my family but one thing is that I can not send links please fix that but other than that it is a great.,
I wish you can change people name and people can change yours and u can change the ringtone when people call you it fine if no but i wish i can rename people like regular messenger this would be so cool.,
"Wow!!!! This app amazing! You can customise your avatar,there are alot of stickers,you can create your own group and a lot more!",
Ok so I am a kid. And this is the app that my parents let me use to talk to my friends. Btw on this app you can also talk to your mom or dad the parents can also call you and text you this app is nice and I recommend it to you bye and have a nice day.,
This is amazing! I can monitor my daughter's texts. You can add family and close friends. Totally worth a 5 starüí´üí´,
I love this app I some times can't even get my face off of it. I love this app so much I think you should deffenitly download this app. I enjoy it so you should deffenitly enjoy it. I LOVE KIDS MESSENGER. HOPE YOU LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,
I'm very disappointedüòû it's not letting me confirm my email at all and it's been having a lot of glitches and they aren't fixing them!,
You cant delete messages so if you accidentally emailed someone else something that you didn't want to send to them you cant delete it and that is all.,
I love it and if u cant pay for texting for kids it is amazing! You can call and text and also have cut 3mojis and GIFs!,
Why do some have the option to start games but ours doesn't.,
"It's easy too use and it safe, it can be a little difficult to connect with friends which makes sense but still",
i love talking with my grandkids but would like to see them on full screen. i do understand why it is a split screen though.,
Having trouble logging. Keeps going in circles asking me to out in my passcode. Frustrating that my kids now can't communicate with their friends.,
"It is so fun and it is not glitchy at all for me! I love how it can be senserd so if anyone shows me bad stuff or tells me bad stuff, my parents can see it!!",
I recommend and recognize this app is useful and experience. For both Parents and child support community college jobs. Let's enjoy today together on this application. We're parents hoped all children around the world complete and successful in his life forever.,
"Nice app for my kids to talk with their friends, but switching the Parent Dashboard/ getting notifications in Messenger, is difficult with multiple children.",
I love this texting App I'm a kid and I can ring my friends from around the globe. Its the best texting App EVER. I recommend people download it,
"This App Is Awesome, I have beed using for 2 Years now and the filters work but i have some camara problems, Parents controls work well but Another thing Is I wanna delete texts but i cant, Please make it so we can",
This app cuts out a lot during calls I have lots of sound issues but otherwise it is pretty good.,
it keeps saying that my app went to sleep and it wont let me get back in this is so frustrating this is the fifth time it has done this and I have only had it for one day,
"It used to work really well, but now photos aren't loading up, no calls at all, messages aren't being read, can't check my user",
Great app! I just totally LOVE talking to my friends and family on messenger kids. I really don't have any complaints about this app. So keep up the good work!,
Works great and I love the parental controls but I wish you could reply with GIFs. The kids can send them but adults can't send them to the kids which doesn't make sense.,
"Great, but it NEEDS Bluetooth support for calls. Other than that it's good. Would rather 5 stars with it.",
This app's option to send any stickers or emojis has quit working for us even on different devices :( How can we fix this?,
I like it but when I get out of the app on a call a few minutes later it hangs up when I'm playing Roblox it really it's really annoying please fix it,
Issues with authorising the connection to Facebook and also swapping accounts between my children. Used to be fine but not working for the last few days,
Not sure how I feel about it haven't used it yet but downloading wasn't bad it was pretty easy so kids could do it ... Patti Davis...,
You can talk to friends if you are quarantining. And you can play games with your friends and it is great for your kids so everyone that has kids should download this app.,
i love this app so much im on it 24/7 only one problum it freezes some times on my screen but i do not care this.my friend moved away to texas and i got her number.This is the best messaging app ever,
I can't sign my child up so I'm giving it a one star. I tried many emails of mine but it still did not work i need help now my child really wants this but i cant give it to her wow.,
i love this app but you cannot delete any messages so -1 for this............And as for the another -1 you cannot voice call......only video call option......so better do this update soon!,
This is a really great app. I use it all the time to chat with friends and realitives. I would recommend to every kid that wants messenger.,
worked great but then new update killed app. it wpmt let u open it. tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still wont work.,
"Love it, berry good, easy to use, gives you weekly reports of what happened in your kid's messenger, calls, media most contacted.",
"i am only 9 years old so i cant have messenger,but when my mom downloaded it i was so happy.my familey lives 6 hours away so i can always text them or video chatthem. this is the perfdct app for me and any other young child who wants to keep in tuch with friends or familey!",
I don't like the fact that I can't accept or add contacts without it telling me try again later. I can't add my brothers in my son's account and they talk every day.,
It's pretty cool me and my friends are always chating in here so it really help me I would give it a five star but it's kinda glitchi it's cool tho I have the best experience in here:),
This is a really good app. It allows kids to talk to friends. It allows people to stay in touch during difficult times like this.,
"I don't see why we have to use a Facebook account just so you can text, why not use email or phone number? If you don't have a Facebook account, then there is no point of getting this app",
This was my favorite app. I could text my friends. Then one day i accidentley deleted it. Now it wont work when i try to log back in. Someone pls tell me how to fix it,
I love this app so nice you know nothing needs to be improved üòä just that we can choose profile pic from our gallery. That's it all over this is then best app,
Great app a little laggy but i love it!!!! Awsome for kids 6 to 12 lots of cool features too. Kids everywhere will love it,
I love it because my kid is in another state and we can message each other and send pictures to each other and she gets to talk with the other kids in her age range.,
At a surten age you should be able to add who ever you want and all the filters should have voice affect and the games on there just suck you should really update it more on these things üëå,
Me and my friends call all the time but the only downside is if 3 people are on the same call and 2 people are in the same room it makes this really loud noise üòÉ,
I love the whole concept of it but I think you should add a dark mode option for everyone who loves dark mode!,
The app is good but I would like to be able to give my kids some freedoms. They cannot change their profile picture to an existing picture. I cannot send them links. I am the account holder for them so I should be able to. I understand why there are security restrictions but I would like to put different people on different security levels. Will kids get avatars?,
You can call and text you best friends when you can't see them it is so useful! Thanks for the app!,
It wont let you send any links. Let's say you wanted to send a meme to your friend or family member and you had to use a link. You can't use Messenger Kids. Also it wont let you send Bitmoji's or anything like that. I recommend normal Messenger!,
"Not allowing account creation.. I decided to disable my old account and make a new one, so my son needed a new one and it won't let me complete registering",
"I like the app and all, but I don't like how it goes to sleep. Sometimes it gets annoying. Otherwise everything is nice.",
I like it because i can talk to my friends who live far and near.It also helps me because i can ask people on it to help me with stuff and it can make me communicate with other people.,
This app is great! There is a mute button a flip camera button and a button to turn your camera off you just need to press yur home screen!,
"Great idea, difficult to add contacts and cannot seem to control more than one kids account per email address. Can I control multiple children's accounts. And how do I add a normal adult messenger account without being friends with them myself or if they do not have a Facebook account?",
I love it and I want to thank everyone that was and is apart of this app .thank you so much for caring about our children and Grandchildren just all children you've out done your self even thought you can never do enough to keep our children safe thank you thank you and thank you over and over me and my family feel very safe for our precious children to have this app you've really done a great job .,
"Great app, it allows my child to keep in touch with her friends while keeping me informed, takes away the worry.",
Amazing! The app helps me comunicate with my friends and have a amazing time with friends and family.,
This is a good app but the problem is my child messeges her friend everyday and once they get to a ceartin amount of messages it says unable to send please gix this up,
I hate this my phone was messed up so I factory reset it so then I thought I could just log into my account on it and guess what I could not so I need to get a new account because this dumpster fire won't let me log into my account,
"I have used messenger kids for a long time now. And the other day I got a new phone and transferred all of my things. And now my mother can't even sign in her Facebook to get into my account. It is just an ongoing loop of ""Can't sign you in."" I'm very sad that I can't use it. What do I do to fix it?",
I love being in control of who my daughter is interacting with on her computer. It's a lot more safe this way!,
Well i love the app i can chat with family and friends but there is this bug with the app when im chating with my cosin and my friend they see the mesages but it dosent say they have sean it i asked my friend for help with some thing and it dosent show me that they saw is ;-;,
"(I'm a kid so by reading this you know what kids think) this app is so fun I am 8 so this is good for kids my age I have my friends Farah and Emily and Rai on messenger kids we talk a lot and I have some of my relatives (that can figure out how to sign inüôÑ) It is family friendly and it has fun games, and photo effects. You should download it NOWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
Keeps updating and removing itself from my phone then having to go through all the steps to sign in again üòï gets annoying. ..,
I love that I can access her account and see everything that is being said in the chats. I love that I control who she is talking to and that I can set up a timer for when she can be active! This is a great way for my daughter to be able to talk to friends and family in a safe way!,
Does not work. App gets stuck in a loop trying to log into parent account during setup. Problem occurs on all devices I own,
"Really like it, because you can't like just add somebody because you can't like add a stranger, it's nice, I'm getting like it.",
Why is there no sign in option? Only sign up. The app is no good on a device shared between siblings. Can you please fix this?,
Is app is easy to use no phone numbers no nothing like that you can easily top something and text someone and then can easily Tap a button to Messenger,
I am having the same issue with not being able to log in. My son stays in touch with his cousins using this. I'm super sad.,
This is a great app it lets you talk to your friends and family i love this and can you add a thing where you can add pets to walk around thanks for reading bye,
I've recently installed this for my kid. Everytime I try and create the account says it failed. I've tried over 15 times and it won't create it,
It has has done so well. But the thing i do not like about it is at one time t was braken it whood cic me off so much. But ofer all i vote it 5stars,
"Nothing works. Nephew can't connect with me, and I can't even make a fake child account to get past my nephew being unable to connect to my adult account. We've been trying for a week with no success. Is this all defunct or something?",
Cannot even log in to this app. Go through the parent log in screen and it sends you straight back to parent log in again.,
"My kid can only send messages to some of her contacts and not others. Need some help, it was great when we first installed it",
"So, you store all photos and details and chats from the kids, and i have to give permission for you to share it also.. Why would you want to share a picture and chat of a child to another 3rd party?",
I am very skeptical about my younger girls having a Facebook or messenger but when I seen kids messenger i figured I'd give it a try and I definitely like how I can control their accounts and see everything if I feel I need to as well as they still get the freedom to talk to their friends or our family.. I like how me and their dad can see what is going on whenever we want and we also get notified when they add people or someone messages them not connected on there,
This app is great for your kid's video calls and messages! It works super well for my daughter!,
"I Like the app, But somehow on my mom's phone her like disappears when she explodes it. It is an issue, But also on my phone my message disappears.",
Can't use the app anymore. It will not allow me to log into daughters account. Just reroutes. To log in page.,
App is not accepting parent password so stuck in an endless loop of not being able to log in. Our kids have existing accounts already!,
I took a picture of myself and it was not good I didn't even sent it!!! AND IT GOT SENT!!! Other than that it's a fine app.,
The app is TERRIBLE. It doesn't let me delete any messages. So i uninstalled it. It is so bad üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé. It wants private information. And it takes up so much space!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Very good I love it it is amazing to text in super fun you can send weird picks I love how if the person that you are texting can receive it super fast love 5 stars,
I love this app! I can add all of my friends and chat with them while I am stuck at home because of Covid-19! Great Job whoever made this!,
"Same issue as other people, keeps looping me back to log on screen. Can't log into account. Can't authorise device",
I love the app it's one of my favourites. But I only have one question do u have to pay for calls or are calls free.,
My son gets stay in touch with his friends and from what I heard it's not that bad and the only thing I feel is for children that are in his area I don't think the parents should have to totally request it but at the same time I do other than that that's amazing,
"Can't Log In, keeps asking for password and fails to login. Same issue as others are saying.",
"I am trying to create account for a week and still getting error messge as some went wrong, I wrote a mail to developer email also few days back but still no response.",
It won't let me login for him. Says authentication failure. Says my Facebook etc is correct but won't let us login.,
Hi this is a great app but i bet u are wondering ''why 4-5 stars?'' Well its because when i do a video call my camerea goes weird and can barely see my face unless i have a super brght light and its ONLY on messenger kids and not my normal camera! But other than that i love this! Please try to fix this!‚úå oh and others see the not enough brightness when they look at me on vid call,
"I love the app, my son loves using it because of the funny filters. I would have gave it five stars but I would like to co-parent on the app.",
"It was a perfect""phone"" for my daughter, but we couldn't get contacts if they were not friends with me on Facebook",
Worse messanger app ever made if i could give zero stars i would let me explain earlier i was calling someone and it said they picked up but it was still ringing?! Like tf is this if u want ur innocnet children to be able to messange their friends then my advice get regular messanger and also the connection sucks balls and u cant send curtant emojis like- kids messanger smells like sweaty turtle balls so yeah more complaints but yeah no room left to type fix ur messanger bye!!!,
"This is a great app! Its just i wish you could undo messages and whenever you block someone your parents wont ask you. Because children have common sense too! Anyways great app for kids, fun activities included! :D",
Horrible app! It won't let me log in. It keeps going in a loop for the login and password page!,
I LOVE THIS APP but Does this app use mobile data?,
Good app. For some reason the contacts i can select for my kids are different. Not sure why.,
I like that my kids can contact their friends through their parents but I wish there was a way to just turn off video chatting vs having to keep the sleep mode on until I'm supervising or my kid calls people randomly.,
When my kid tried to call her friend it kept saying * Connecting*,
Needs to work without Internet.,
So loading and something wrong about it.,
"I love that they can have a ""4 word code"" but I think you should be able to pick the words bc the ones msngr sent are too hard to remember!!!!",
good apps for kids,
It's a good app but we're having a hard time adding friends..I keep getting an error has occurred....,
SUPER is a small word !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
I use it a lot and it's fun,
I cant sign up because its not giving me a code,
Ive been trying to do my childs acc but it doesnt let me,
This is a great app I can talk to me friends and family really easy but all my friends have the update and I don't know how they did it üòî,
Great App for kids,
I can talk to my friends so I like it,
This good for kids,
Please make it for computers too.,
"I'm stuck in the same login/authorize loop as described by others. When enter my login info, it takes me right back to do it again.",
"I LOVE this app. My son is 11, and even though he can stay at home alone 4 a short time, I have him on this app. When he wants he can call!!",
WHY DO WE HAVE TO USE FACEBOOK LOGIN MY KID NOR ME HAVE FACEBOOK!!!!üò°,
The glitch this app is a bad app,
It's good I talk to friend me happy üòä,
It won't let me create an account. Can someone please fix this.,
Is the best. friends and family contact you,
Nice app for kidsüòäüíïüíûüíó‚ù£Ô∏è,
Isn't letting me add contacts like her own dad,
It's a beautiful apps,
Won't let us add anyone link won't open even tho I have the app set on my adult phone like required. Still won't open link for code or to add people,
so good to call people so good to call people,
IT WONT EVEN LET ME MAKE AN ACCOUNT THIS IS STUPID,
Annoying to install,
"Just discovered this app for my daughter but after I log into my FB part it take me to a section to create an acct for her, I put her information in and tells me issue has happened cannot create account. It keeps saying this, not sure what can be done so I can create an account for her??",
Not letting me sign my kid up please tell me why it won't let me please,
Good for kids,
Good for kids,
"Good messaging app for kids with one issue, as a parent/guardian we should be able to send web links to our kids, or share whatever videos or articles WE think are appropriate and not get blocked by Facebook's pages/videos age ratings.",
This app is awesome to call and talk to your friends...but it logged me out and wont let us back in...just repeats the log in screen over & over...,
It's a great app and Ive only had some problems like I can't update it and sometimes my text won't send but overall it's a great app for kids üëçüèºüôÉ,
"Love that my kids can enjoy the talking to their friends without having to worry about them talking to strangers, Especially because I can approve or disapprove friend requests and monitor their conversations and contacts.",
Great app I use it and it's fun. The only this is when you call sometimes it makes your screen black,
Nice appüòÉ but sometimes some of my freinds calls are real laggy and I don't know if it's the app or their internet or mine and u should keep all the filters I like some then there gone üôÅ,
I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars when the issue with authorizing for log in gets fixed. My child loves using this app however unfortunately we can't get them logged back in.,
"This is a very nice app, but the problem is when i want to call people sometimes it does not show im calling them.",
Awesome way for my daughter to be able to talk to ftiends and family all while I can monitor it for her safety without having to be intrusive towards her.,
I love this your kids can text you and friends play games and text relatives send voice messages so if you want to be able to text your kid download this app.,
My daughter LOVES Mesenger kids! She talks with her friends almost every day on the app! She texts and video chats on the app!üëç,
I love the security on this app I can see all of my kids things they do and they can still text and face time there friends and family!,
I love messenger kids but whenever I try to play a game I can click on it but then it won't let me play it. Please fix it cause I'm sad =(,
"Messenger kids allows me to choose who my child speaks with. It's a safe, reliable app. I highly recommend it!",
would not recommend this app by any means if you have situations that happen often. We now fleas cause i cant send my mom links to videos/pictures to know how to get rid of fleas plz fix this now!!!!!,
Apps amazeing. But it won't let me update it. All y friends have the latest version of the app. And I dont. How do I upgrade it if thats possible?,
It would never let me upload my child's pic and it wouldn't let me skip it; so we were never able to use the app.,
Great App! I am a kid and i love this app so much i used to get so many random messages on snapchat and i was getting tired of it i saw your commercial and i decided to try it its basically like messenger and skype for kids! i love this so much thank you Messenger! - Nicholas Allen,
"I love this, I can talked to my friends, my family members, and since the Corona virus, I Can't go to my friend's house to talk so I like how you can video chat or text I do recommend this app!!! 5 START üëç",
It keeps logging my child out and giving a login failure message . PLEASE FIX! The report problem buttom never comes up!,
Very good I'm 10 and I love this app although.i wish we can. Name our friends different names and not just in groups,
I love this app! It is so much fun for kids and there friends! So they can coecct with friends and family!!,
"The app is ok but I keep getting logged out, can someone fix this please? Also why can you only use your camera for your profile picture? You should be able to use your gallery too.",
"Absolutely could not get this app to work, and no fricken idea why. So frustrated!",
Pets vs have you tried to turn on nodifications and then turn it off and turn it back on it? works for me,
"Its great, my kid can talk to their friends and can play games with them.",
Why does messenger kids not have the games like messenger my kid wants to play with her friend on messenger kids but they don't have the games. And I also want it to share the screen,
Best app ever for kids but if you like youtube and do not want to lose it then you just stick to another app but other wise best app,
"1. your app glitches, 2. its annoying to just always to log in every time i leave the app. 3. whenever im on call my camera and voice glitches",
Same issue as many of the recent reviews. Endless login loop. Meta is impossible to make contact with.,
When I try to call my daughter via messenger it rings in my end And asked me to pick up for my daughter.... Totally confusing but other than that great app!,
OMG I love this app. my kids can easily text and call me whenever the filters are amazing! I totally reccomend this!,
I really like this app!Now I can talk to my friends and family members.My mom used to get mad when I texted my family.Now I can type on my tablet.You can also call them.You can play games with your friends and family! This a great app for kids! Thank you very much üòä,
I would give this a four but no because its annoying that every single time my app falls asleep or whatever my friend text me but I can't text backüôÅüôÅüôÅ,
cant delete old acct. cant get into my profile only my childrens. ive downloaded it several times just for it to say i need to download the app to read the messages when in fact it is downloaded on my phone. very frustrating,
"Doesn't even work. Been trying on and off for 2 months to make my daughter an account. I get the same message saying ""something went wrong: account creation failure.""",
I really liked it but I just didt get any notifications no calls no messages and then when I go on it I have like 10 messages not read!,
Its amazing I go on it everyday and I see one of my friends online and you can even get your bff to call you! I gave it a five star because it is the best also you can video chat with your friends!,
Good app but not that good it takes a whole lot of space doesnt notice me when I have texts minigames are very laggy too and lags alot in calls alot even if I have a good connection,
"The app is nice, I just think if you could share links and share screens on calls, that would make it a 5 star for me.",
It is awesome! I love knowing that I am safe on messenger with parental controls on. I love this app. I love to text family and friends. ‚ô°,
It is THE BEST I'm able to chat with my friends quite easily and there is really cool filters and I'm even able to FACETIME with friends AND family,
I do like the fact of being able to see the conversations between my child and others. Is a good app!!,
I typed in my email and password and I can't even log in it keeps on saying logged out I keep redownloading it it still doesn't work fix your appüò°üò°üò°,
It is very good so i sugest to get it (ps sometimes it glitches and you cant hear anything and you muted but thats usauly only about 10 seconds or less),
So basicly i downloaded this app and it does not do anything! it is just stuck on the same screen! Can you fix this? And i use a chrome book.,
It is a great app and I am able to chat and message my friends and family without any trouble! I love this app and I strongly recomend it!,
Love this app!! It is amazing and I can talk to all of my friends and my parents even with a Samsung android!! Hope this helps!!!üòÅüòÅüòÄüòä‚ò∫,
I love this app my son is 2 and it makes it so easy to get ahold of him well I'm at work and the babysitter as well I get to video chat him and everything I would highly recommend it,
"Super annoying to set-up, encourages kids to have their own devices, useless functionality, I hate it.",
The app needs a boy/girl mode and more filters for boys. Don't like the split screen needs to be like messenger with picture in a picture.,
Can't find her yet!,
I lave this app because it alwows kids to talk to their friends and it is also good because this coronavires kids can't see there friends so they get to talk to them like this.That is why I love this app.,
it is great but i don't see why you can't use normal messages but that is ok i love all the games that you can play and 6hat new fillters come out everyday,
Absolutely awful. Been trying to connect with my child for weeks and still have not spoken with her.,
"FULL parent control of who, what your child sees or is allowed to access. Allows parents to text their children without having to add a phone line, just needs internet. I like how the service includes a recording of what your child does at all time.",
Its good but the problem is that my daughters device has no wifi most of the time and this is the only tablet avaliable. and i had a hard time posting this.,
how come the camera off button is gone? i can only have my camera on and it's really annoying. I'd like to be able to turn my camera off and have some privacy.,
Good app. A small kid I know told me how good this app was as a replacement messenging app compared to FB messenger. Thank you Facebook for connecting me to the unbeknown world of the intahnetz and also in the 'dark' web.,
Won't let me search for adults on my friends list. Super annoying as the kids can't add their friends.,
This app is pretty good but the only complait i have is that some other of my friends have one filter that i dont have have and mine is updated.,
The reason I picked five stars is because messenger kids is awesome because you can chat with your friends art tablet or computer and if you don't have a phone it's easy to use messenger kids and not those big kids text so that's why I really love listen to kids because I can chat with all my friends on my tablet no biggie at all has so much stuff you could be busy for hours so that's why I gave messenger kids five stars.,
It crashes as soon as you open it tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but it still does the same thing,
Great app! Really appreciate the features to help parents keep an eye on who and what is happening and it helps keep them safe,
"This is awful. I entered my email address and password for my son to start text relatives and friends, but I entered my email address and password and it didn't work. I've wasted 45 minutes trying to fix this.",
Was working great then all of the sudden my daughter can only message some of her friends but video calling works on all of the friends.,
Like the others... I'm stuck in a perpetual login loop. I can't get past entering my login before it looks for my account again.,
The camera quality is always so clear and fabulous. The app is great for when my brother wants to see me but can't come to my house!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüëçüíô,
Everytime I Google kids Messenger app. It says I can set it up without using my Facebook period so I took the time to download the app ensure enough it's asking me to log into Facebook. I don't want anything connected to my Facebook so why lie,
"This is not the greatest app its in fact the worst but it is all i can text on so fix this app and u will get a 5 star reveiw,but i think it is a safe and an amazing app for kids though so thx for making itüòä",
I think it could have more colors more games it should let you call 2 friends a once. But I love it it's a good game,
love the app that way I can make contact with my family to see if they're ok because I don't want them to get in any trouble or mess like getting into fights so I can get them some attention so they focus on any thing they aren't interested in thank you sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much for creating this app in that is all in my‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíûüíïüíöüíôüíúüñ§üíõüß°üíóüêòüëà,
I love it I can take to my friend's and family I would fit it if you do not trust your kid and need to call them or text them and that got a pet to.They can friend people that you no and that is on the app.So I would recommend This app.,
Too easy to break and lag. Very fun to do i love it! Except for the cringy stuff. üôÉ,
"Love how easy the dry up is, I get a notification every time someone sends something to our son. The monitoring is so easy.",
four stars because it glitches out when you call and you can't do it right but if it does it right to you you can call people and they start you off with a parent you know and you can take pictures I liked the pictures that I sent you can make cute pictures nice pictures funny pictures weird pictures nasty pictures üíóüíóüíóüíóü§´,
"Overall great app, but my only issue is that it wont let me nickname my friends or when im changing my profile picture, it will not let me upload pics from my gallery",
you got rid of tje school suplies filter bring it back add more filters make a mario one i would rate it 5 stars but me and my friend want the school suplies filter Back BOO! BOO!!! dpwnload episode its free,
I like the app I think it is a safe way for kids to comnuiticate with others in a way that they feel like they have freedom but also having parents being able to have some control.,
Easy to maintain although I'd like the option to check conversations without going on to my child's account.,
"Kid freindly app im a kid my self but the problem is when i chat my cousin or a freind for example sometimes it would give me a notification saying i cant send this or that you cant send a link im just texting normal stuff and then suddenly jt says ""your message was not sent""",
"was working great and now when i click it, it crashes. i used this app to stay in contact with my son.",
I really love it but when I don't get on for a bit it needs a code or something and when I get on and notice I get mad cause I was going to text my parents but I don't know the code so they usually do it but they aren't here to do it so it sucks and I can't make my own drawings and stuff so that makes it suck alot more but the rest is still good,
"its not happening! i feel it and dont know why. there is no going back if what you choose you keep. my heart is beating hard and i like the feeling. Because it reminds me that i have one. I always put my Grandkids 1st. everyone moved down on the totum poll. I dont have a favorit right Sawyer. So now no grandchild needs to ask me ""GAMMA WHOES YOUR FAVORIT"" right Sawyer.",
I think is a good app for my kid because she can contact her family and friends is just a great app love it 100% üíØüíØüíØ,
"Very handy app, helps bridge the gap between giving a younger child a full fledge cellphone with service.",
Its the best app you could wish for your kids like it has stickers emojis and u can face time but you can't call normal just face time please fix that but the u should clearly install it,
I love this app it's just one bug or glitch on Samsung u can't change the fact color change voice for texts and apples have way more pls fix this,
Great for younger ones to keep in touch with family under your control and facebook. Easy to use also!,
I love this app it is a great app um I really recommend it I love texting and calling my friends some of my friends from school are on there you should really check it out,
"It's very easy to use, and is appropriate for kids You can text, face time and do lots of fun things",
It is a kid friendly and fun app with little badges they can earn! My daughter LOVES it very much! A GREAT app!,
"Good app, would give more stars but not being able to add a grandparent for some reason, just says an error occurred every time I try...",
"I like this app because I can have my kid chat with her friends, but it dose need to update alot. Overall tjus is a good app",
"You can call, add anyone that has the app and an account, and text. I can communicate well with my friends so it's SOOOO fun!",
"Its wonderful! My younger kids love it because they ffel like there getting the same privillages of there older sister, but i have the peace of mins knowing there being safe!",
"Its a good app and its fun, my only issue is that android dosent have the option to use the gallery for you profile picture wich us pretty crappy..",
awful! I cannot get into my fb acct to.set this up for my daughter. when I put in my e-mail or phone number it says no acct found. makes no sense! so annoyed!,
The app is not able to send messages and the calls do not work and I have restarted it many times but it does not work,
It is a good app!1 I can video chat.2 I can play games.3 it is like tik tok Except It is not by China and The app is not watching me. It is the most amazing app ever and I am Emma,
I love this app and so does my kid I totally recommend it I can see my kids text and she gets to talk to her long distance friend and more friends,
Four stars cause it wont update i see that my friend has this music thing to play on but i cant get it to update so i can do that im not sure why... It makes me mad why wont it update,
"As a parent, I think the app is handy and fun for my youngster. The safety features are good and it's easy enough for him to use.",
Its awesome you can talk with all of your friends that are on the app and draw cool pictures and it super safe!,
This is a great app to have during this quarantine! It allows me to see my friends with great quality!,
"It's a great way for kids to be able to safely contact family and friends. But can you please make it possible to send longer videos, and if not, to film longer videos on the messenger kids camera?",
It keeps kicking me out of the app whenever I'm texting or in a call and it never sends videos I will give 5 stars once they fix this,
I did it 4 stars because when you sent something and you want to delete it you can't delete it and i wish that you fix this with an uptade please and to let it perfect !,
It wont let me log in to the app I am very frustrated. I enter the password right then it kicks out to the login,
"It's decent for the most part, yet they stop showing a lot of my photos and stop showing other people's photos",
its really cool but it should not let you text swears to people and it lets you block someone and unblock them and report someone/ something and once its there its there is app is AMAZINGLY AWESOME,
"This app is good for kids, but it's glitchy, when I try to call a group, the call randomly cancel the call",
It's fun because you can connect to your friends and family and you can make some stickers and take photos and be silly and just you can just send them to your friends and family it's it's a great app,
This is not allowing to logging me in even though entered password correctly.Its just goes in loop asking again and again .Is it happening on Android OS.Please rectify asap,
"Overall its really great. The only reason i gave 4 stars is because it takes up to much storage on my device. That might not be the same for everyone though, *im just sharing my opinion not hating*",
Great options for kids. The only reason one star was off is the kids invite codes. They are kinda crazy. And I wish parents could follow conversations.,
It is a great app and I recomend it for your children. I like it because you can contact friends and famaly .,
The app has this really stupid feature were you can only take a photo for your profile instead of selecting one from your gallery.,
This will not let my son log in! It keeps going back to the log in screen. Super annoying!,
It's the best there's nothing wrong with it no ads and it's just like any messenger but better there's even games and more!,
It KEEPS glitching and I TRY to update it and it WONT LET ME it says /Sorry you can't update this app So I rate this THREE Just let me update I tried to do everything like restarting it powering It Off and it won't let me,
The Application is so perfect i give it a five star because we can talk in messeges and in video calls even if you are far you can still talk!,
I think messenger kids is an amazing app for kids to communicate and adults too I do hope that you can have the tiger filter back on overall I love messenger kids though I have 12 friends on here and I also think that we should be able to voice call and video chat.,
"Crashed device on install, play store notification it was already installed on unlock after the auto reboot, tried running it, greeted with white screen and crash feedback, crashed on reopening.",
Great app! My kiddo loves it and super easy to use. I just wish the messages where time stamped.,
"I've been trying to create account since Monday but it keeps saying ""Failed to update your fav color"" üòûüòû is there anything I can do to fix it on my sideüëê",
I like this app because it's easy to use and I can control who can contact my child and I can see her activities and conversation with friends.,
"Great,I really liked this app cause I can see what the kids are saying and It's all kid apropiate.Plus they can chat with friends and families while having fun",
It's very useful I can speak or text to friends and family thats not near me but if you spamming it it lags so try not to spam it but other than that is really usefull,
"So annoying... My kids,even when I tried to sign up on this with my Facebook, it's still not working..",
Good for texting. Video calls can get a bad signal sometimes.,
"I don't really like it because when you want to call somebody,it says can't call right now and if they call you it won't let you answer I like every thing else but I would still give it a 3",
i am happy that i am able to track and monitor everything my child is doing. also see who he talks to and who talks to him. but as any concerned parent im still a little sketchy about it.,
"Doesn't give me notifications when someone texts me which is a big problem, but other than that it's a good app.",
"I am unable to create an account. I have been trying for 4 weeks, I reported this to FB 5 times and I even reported this to the developer. Can anybody help me to fix this issue? Thank you.",
"WONDERFUL, COOL, FUNNY & A GREAT app for my kids... They can text & facetime family w/ really funny add-ons. I recommend this app for anybody that has children and family far awayüòÄüíõüíôüíúüíö‚ù§üíïüíñüíûüòÇ",
Messenger kids is great! It is so good that kids under the age of 13 can have Messenger. But it would be great if bitmoji would be available on it.,
"It's a cool app. I can talk to my friends and family with it, but I really wish you could make your profile image a photo from your gallery.",
"Won't let me authorize my device. My password is correct, it just reloads the same screen and won't log in.",
I like messenger kids it is a good app but the only thing is it takes forever to load a voice thing or a picture or a video and a sticker 8t might be my internet but idk but yeah that is my review,
"SEPARATE KID'S MESSENGER DINGS FROM THE PARENTS' MESSENGER DINGS!!! Everytime my son is having a conversation I get every single ding from each message! ANNOYING. And also, as parents we should have an option to allow whether or not your child can video call. That's a pretty BIG DEAL!!!",
It won't let my child login to the app to sign up and that's a bit of rude for that but if anybody can help me with advice or something that would be very helpful at this moment,
This app is the best my child can talk with her friend and it only doesn't work on WiFi but it's normal cause its normally like that any way.,
Great app for kids. My child could call me by themself. It's better that my child didn't use massager but use this instread cause I don't have to create new account on facebook.,
This app is the best! I love how I can chat with my friends!! I dont have any negative thoughts to this game! Perfect for kids under 13 when you cant get snapchat!,
it is a fun way to interact and see each other while were in lockdown.we especially love the different filters,
It's a pretty cool app but personally I think they should up grade it a little like for example better filters like funnier or cuter ones lol but other than that ok app pretty boring,
This app is so bad that my kid never leaves his ipad which has this app.We need to make our kids more active than playing games and texting all the time. I give this app just 1 star because of group massaging an texting.,
"I really like messenger kids cuz it let .e talk and call with my friends! But what I don't like is that if you don't have wifi and you send something but it doesn't send, I wish it sent with you DO have wifi. And how you want to friend, friends, but your parents have to accept it. Cause what if they don't? But anyways, I like messenger kids üòÅ",
It doesn't pop up when people text me.,
"The app was working great, now it will not let me log in, it keeps going back to verify parent email.",
This app is great it lets me communicate with some of my family members and freinds. It's just nice though I kinda don't really like the games.,
It's pretty cool but it's kinda hard to sign in and talk with my friend but other then that it's amazing great app :),
I love this app. It has helped my to young for social media kids connect with family and friends from all over.,
Whenever you log out you can't recover your account i want the old version back no matter how hard i tried its STILL NOT WORKING!,
Every time i look for a contact i cant find it its like they were never there in the first place and now i cant talk to that person and i need to and i just updated it and its the same and i still cant find the person and its frustrating,
This app won't work at all it keeps saying that it cannot create a profile please try again later it's been saying that all day won't even let me create an account,
"It won't let me send messages, what the heck, I don't like this app,its so annoying. I cant do enything.",
I like this app and all but I use it to text my mom sometimes and I went to text her and I couldn't find her profile to text her or my dad's but everyone else's was there so I wonder what's happening and the same thing happened even after I updated it,
Really good app for kids. Parents can see everything and it has fun face filters and stickers for kids to send pics.,
I don't like it because I loved out on accident AND I CANT LOG BACK IN and when I play a game my screen go's back and when I play doors rush comes when my screen go's black so I die plsfix this,
Messenger kids is good i can text so many people and I never have issues but I cannot update it bothered is a thing on Messenger kids that you can dance to a song but I cannot find it at all otherwise Messenger kids is great,
My kids absolutely love this app. Keeps them in touch safely with family and their friends. We have had no problems with it.,
Can not get passed the log in page and its frustrating !! Needing to find another app for my 3 children and I to communicate!!,
"I would rate this a 0 if I could. How come this isn't available AT ALL for desktop? Not even through a web browser. Not all kids have access to a cell phone or tablet.i had been hoping my.kids could talk to friends and family with this but they only have use of a desktop computer. Seriously, please make a web browser version. If normal Facebook Messenger can, you can",
She loves keeping in conta cc t with all her friends. I am very impressed with your app as a parent thank you for all the hard work you have done keep it up .,
I like it but I don't have Facebook to sign up for it maybe you can add Google sign up but overall my kid said it's a great app so I'm not giving up so please solve this problem üëçüëçüòåüòå,
"I love this app but the reason I gave it four stars is because it ends calls randomly, I would give it it's final star if it gets fixed.",
I've been trying to get into my account to friend someone from my school and whenever I enter my password for the validation it kicks me out and I have to re-enter my password again (I even reset my password to see if that'll help),
I love this app of kids messenger it's so easy to run and I can contact my friends I can get ahold of my parents whenever I need them all I have to do is click a button and type in a few words and then can you talk to them now I love kids Messenger I'm giving a 5 stars,
"I found this some what intriguing how fast i could fix a mistake with this app. love it, but it is a little slow.",
I love this app so much‚ù§!!!! Because every one is quarintened i can face time them and this is really helpful app for me so i can feel better to because quarintune thanks so much for this app‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,
You need to do bug fixes! Its so glitchy it keeps freezing my friends and hanging up! Ugh so annoying.,
My kids use it every day to talk to their friends and family and I like that I can see what the send each other. Thank you for this wanderful app.,
Recomended. Great and safe app that you can allow your child to have friends and you are able to know what is happening.,
it frezzes everytime we use it so theres deff bugs that need to be worked out on the next update. other then that it works get,
It's great for my youngest to keep in touch with his aunts and cousins. And its safe. Plus I get to monitor the friends and in/out going messages.,
Very good app to talk to friends,
Won't let me set it up keeps just jumping back to the login screen have tried on more than one device. Absolute rubbish,
This is a great app! you can do many things. you can make groups but if you want one with a friend and your friend you cant!,
"Not a fan. I have tried to set it up several times but all I get is the ""Something went wrong"" pop up message.",
This app is amazing my daughter loves it she was so shy and then she got this app and she is not shy anymore this app connected her with new people and now she has a lot of friends,
It is really frustrating that there are no notifications when someone calls you or sends you a message.,
When I had accidentally clicked call I was brought into a call in which I did not want to be in and when trying to end it it would not let me so in that case I could not call anybody else,
"i4 was good for a while but now it just says ""ur app went to sleep""im like ok but when i get of the app an go on another it pops up and says ""ur app went to sleep"" then it pops up like every 10 secounds intill i shut my tablet off all the way then come back on an i cant go on that app cuz it will do it again an again so plz fix!!!!!!!!!üò†üò¢üò†üò¢üò†üò¢üò†üò¢",
messenger kids is the worst i hate how when you put your picture in you can never change it to an icon again its not possible i try nothing happensüò°but you get to talk with friends and its like snapchat i hate and love it at the same time.üò∂,
It's a good app but when ever I call anyone sometimes it stops in the middle of the call and then it also says other are online when I'm at there house and there not even on there phone,
You need to fix when someone texts and you get it like 2 days later because that i happening to me and is really annoying.,
My daughter loves it so much she can talk to her friends and it just works beautifully you should definitely get this app it is awesome,
üíúüíúMessenger kids üíúüíú the best app ever it has really fun games and you can chat and video chat with your friends and family üòçüòçüå∏üå∏ you can also take funny photos who would not like it it's amazing wonderful appüíõüíõüèÜüèÜ its even better than messenger üòÇ ‚ò∫Ô∏è I think everyone likes it and says its amazing wonderful everyone üíéüíé,
It's good for me a bit laggy if you miss use.,
It's very good for children Very good creation,
It is dumb and doesn't send your messages,
Me and my friend can't tap to change the characters like the candy girl and the goth girl I can't switch to the goth girl.,
Bluetooth known issue no fix,
It's not working! It would just turn white then shut down. How is my child going to use this if its broken very disappointing.,
this is the best kid frindley texting and calling app!,
I love this app personally but sometimes when I video chat the persons face wont come up and sometimes it says it needs a update but I just updated it.ü§©üòâüòåüòï,
It's kid friendly and you need to approve the request for your kid,
It's very nice for kids to meet there friends,
So i do like messenger u can chat to yr friends. But the games do not show me the filters or the games and I'd like that to be fixed.thats why i gave the app 4 stars,
My daughter love it. She say that she's like being a kitten. She's can make her dreams by this app. You can't being a kitten in real life. But it just an imagination.,
This Is Just Like SOOO Cool on Hangouts you can NOT send gifs or stickers. :) You can text your friends and like its pretty fun!!!! :D,
this is the best app i have been on it non-stop not only does it limit who you talk to it keeps you safe from creeps and wierd people also child predators are not a problem,
I love messenger kids!! But one thing I do wish is that you could make your profile picture a photo from your gallery. Overall I love messenger kids! I rate this app ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,
"Hey developers, I would appreciate if there was a way to turn off sound effects for the minigames and this app is great for kids preteens as well",
I love this app because im a kid and i get to message my parents even though i dont have a SIM card and i also get to message my sibkings or my friends too so uts extremely fun to have as an app on your phone !,
"I love it, but it keeps signing me out whenever im talking to my friends, please fix that.. I would be texting my friends, and id get signed out",
My daughter loves being able to call her friends and family and I love the fact that I can see and control who she speaks to. I do however wish that there was a way to change the profile picture.,
Wont accept our information and allow it to work. On my other kids devices works fine. Nothing diffrent about his. Had to install duo,
My kid loves this so much and I love it too cause I can see who she talks to and also I get notified if someone try to add her with out asking all out awesome app,
Its the best my friend can chat with me now. even around the world its them safe game i clicked a knife emoji and it did not show. Thats how safe it is i recamend this game thank you how ever made this game,
"my granddaughter uses this app to talk to me and after last update it won't open! It just flashes and goes back to her home screen..please fix this !,,",
"Too many glitches still. Freezes up, delay and echo on voices. otherwise a fun app for kids",
App will not allow me to make a page for my 4yr old son. Keeps saying something went wrong please try agian. Everytime I try!!!!!,
"My kid loves it, because she can keep in contact with her cousins and family and close friends but my husband and I are having a problem with trying to approve the same 3 contacts over and over again because it refuses to accept them.",
i love this app i use it everyday but im only giving it 4 stars because you cant turn your camera off and you have to go to a different app so your camera will turn off,
Perfect but you should add zooming so when you playing a game on Xbox or a TV you could zoom in on it so the other person could see it,
it is awesome talking to all my friends and family and making group chats and if you wanted to have a play date you could text them and say hey waunna have a playdate get back soon and if you dont know anyone on it block it.I highly recommend thisüòçüíôüíú,
I mean it's good like it's fun and actually able to chat with friends and family but laggy-ish that's the only thing that bothers me,
It will not let me log in. I use my password and even tried the one time code...it will not let me log in. Facebook fix this glitch!!,
Very very bad when I log in and do the correct password it takes me back to the login screen had problem for months cant contact my friends :( Would not recommend pls fix the issue kids messenger,
I love kids Messenger so kids and adults can stay in touch. I think it will teach kids lots of new things about other people so keep kids messenger I think other kids and I love the opportunity for kids to text in a safe way so they can be in touch with people who moved to a a new school new state or maybe even a new country so keep it up Love Aubrey,
Stopped working. Won't let us log back in. Either it says the password is wrong or that we have reached an API limit.,
Great app for all parents and kids. It allows parents to get with their kids. Really great for divorced parents .,
I really enjoy Messengers for kids my son and me contact each other constantly through it it's fun and it keeps you connected I like it a lot,
"My experience is okay, my 2 complaints are you cant send gifs and you cant choose from gallary for your profile pic but over all it is an amazing app I got it when I was eight I'm 11 now",
"When ever I try to log in it says ""logging out"" and starts over the login. I hope this gets fixed.",
It's an ok app but it's just so hard to login my mommy and sister and daddy couldn't help me with logingin it's so so hard to but other than that it's a pretty cool app but it took me 3 days to log in üôÑüòç‚ù§Ô∏èü§£üòì,
Its a great app for kids and I like that I can control things like contacts and have it turn off at night.,
This app is awesome I love it the game is super fun. Me and my friend would talk for hours. It is good and free. Love it.,
Nice for texting. But I'm a teen and the filters are terrible and not engaging for teens.,
"It's soo awsome. I can talk to my friends, i can play creative games. I definitely recommend this app.",
I thought it was very useful to message my friends when i feel like it but i the filters are good but i wish there were more optionsüëå,
When I Call My Friend it always disconnects every 2 minutes it makes me very angry and sometimes i wanna smash my computer bc of how many times i call back.,
Wont create account. Everytime just says Account Creation Failure. Downloaded and redownload 3 times and still doesn't work.,
Im a kid using this and it is amazing I can communicate with all my family and it can be funny during the calls and it is a safe app to use I highly recommend it,
I would like it better if you could also put it on a Microsoft book laptop. thank you!,
"Does not notify you when someone messages you when not in the app like the ""adult"" messenger does. Not sure if friends are receiving a notice that I have messaged them.",
"Great for kids. Sometimes when the kids call, the video doesnt go through and I have to call them back",
It's just amazing so creative writing with her friends calling them FaceTiming them just a really fun way to interact with your friends,
Its great at the beginning but after it takes approximantly a handfull of minutes before it opens and its very slow.,
Well I think that you have to delete stuff and you may not have enough apps to delete that they don't let you if you don't have a lot of apps and it's telling you to delete more then you can't get the kids messenger so I think this is unnecessary,
It works very well I can talk to my friends and family and play games with them and face time them!I would totally recommend it for your kids,
This is perfect for children to chat on. It's better for children to use this app then the real Facebook messagner.,
Very useful! Some android devices that can't install messenger can install this app! Amazing! And parents have full control over their children using this app,
Stuck in a loop from log in page don't bother it won't let you log in. Have tried uninstall and reinstall even old versions but same issue,
"safe way to keep in touch with the grandkids. Encourages reading and writing. Or you can video chat, which works well for younger kids.",
I've done lots of thing on this. It is hard to get into this app but you can add anyone that has the same app even if there states away,
I think personally it's amazing you can chat with your friends 24/7 and I just really like it!,
I just wish I could have monitored closer what was said without having to go in my kids phone. Otherwise great app.,
"Being able to chat, facetime and play games with my 9 year old granddaughter has brightened my life so much. We live on different sides of the country so this has really brought us together. TY",
This is a stupid app i dont know if i need to update it but it keeps logging me out and i need the app because i need to talk on their ANYWAY ITS A WORTHLESS APP AND YEAH and no i cant just update it i have no storage üò°üò°üòë,
Ehh this app is OK. One thing that bothers me though is that when I try to send a video it won't work. Please fix this.,
"This is a very awesome app, I am 10 years old and I dont see anyway you can even improve it. Love the app!",
Its a really fun app where you can text your friends id suggest for kids and ADULTS.Even if there might be another way they communicate id suggest this app this is really easy to use.,
I do not like this app for 1000 reasons....you have to give a Facebook account!!!..WHAT if you don't have an account on Facebook and why would you give private information.!?!?!..plus sometimes it dosen't work...please fix this so ppl can enjoy.,
I really like Messenger kids and I use it every day's but the problem is I have the new version and I don't enjoy it I note love the old version please do the old version back :),
I like it because i can talk to my friend maggie and my cousin emily and i dont need to see them in person but the thing i dont like is that it dos'nt let me add my sister and she is a teenager i think its rather that the game dos'nt let me or that i cant add teenagers.,
"Awesome! I love it! It's good for my 6 year old to talk to family and friends. It makes her feel ""grown up"" and it helps with social skills also.",
Great app! But when i call my cousin my phone freezes over and over and we always have to stop calling please fix this!,
It's a great app for kids who are just starting to message to connect with others. I love it and it has great maneuverability.,
For some reason it won't let me text even when I update it and I am upset because I can't text my family and friend to say what I'm gonna do overall it is a good game but please fix this,
"This is an amazing app for kids, but when I send somthingg, it takes soooo long to send like more than 1 day. My phone is Nokia C1 btw",
The best app of ever downloaded it's my favorite app The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't do regular calls you can only do video chats,
i just wish they didnt have the facebook thing cause i tried logging in through my face book account but it said login fail so thats what i dont like so if the app could please help me create my account ive tried over 20 times to create my account but it still said login fail.,
Its okay i guess but the thing is sometimes it breaks and it sometimes makes my phone go black when I call someone and put my hand next to it FIX IT NOW,
I think it's a great way to interact with your friends or family. Sometimes it's alittle glitchy though.,
love this app! it's great! My kids can keep up with friends and family while I make sure its in a safe manner!,
Its fantastic cause i can always chat but i wish it would work offline but its ok anyways i love it cause i can use filters and play games and its very enertaining.,
Great way for kids to communicat with other kids. Also the app helps parents to argue with the kids for there phone. SO THANK YOU AND I MEAN IT YOU MADE IT TO EASY FOR US PARANTS üëèüëè WERE HAPPYüòÄüòÄüòÜüòÜüôÑüôÑ,
So bad!!! It would never let me sign up because it says to check my internet connection but my internet connection is good! So I dont know what to do please help! üò§,
I like that I can see everything that my child is doing. Difficult to add friends and family though.,
"I love this app - When I message my friends I can't send messages. It says ""unable to send""",
"It's a good app to talk with friends, family and more! I really recommend it its 100% kid safe!",
I love this app and since my parents don't allow me to have messenger this app is perfect. Messenger kids is the same as regural messenger but with badges and it is much more fun and safe.üôÇ,
I love this app because i can keep in contact with my mum and dad and siblings and friends and i love it because no ads or other apps come up it us the best app ever you should definitly downlaod this app it is the best thing everüíúüíúüíúüíìüíìüíóüíó,
It's very good app the only problem I have with it is all the updates come a year later fore me Evan no I updates it constantly like I can change the chate room or the thing in a video call so if you can fix this pls,
Amazing!!!!! I use this app to chat with my extended family. The quality of the facetime videos is stupendous! Thank you so much for this amazing app!!!!!!!,
Man itext my freinds and family im a kid in 1 grade and thats whos talking so maybe ill say words wrong but its ok so messenger is a really cool app and i text my freinds alot i wish there was some picturs on it so i can show you what i mean but its really cool so im giving it 5‚≠ê this app is really coool,
This is great for my kids safe can chat cute filters just what i need to distract them during this pandemic i really love this app i suggest this for kids over 5,
Downloaded for daughter she loved it but now all it does is crash. Then the feedbck message pops up randomly.,
i love this app beecause me and my friends can talk to eachother and they have fun activities and this is a great app for a child like me :),
This app is great for kids! It lets the parents decise who the child can talk with and the child can decorate their profile. Overall 10/10,
"Love this app for my 4 year old. He can keep in touch with his grandparents, aunts and uncles, and cousins and he has a blast doing it. Couldn't be happier with this app for him!",
Problematic. Games and filters are not working. Just says loading them nothing happens. Please fix.,
I love this app I can text my friends and say happy birthday to everyone and my parents can see what and who I've texted. I can have family members on here too.,
One of the best apps I've ever had it's so funny that they communicate with your friends and it's funny that's really cool video chat with your friends and yeah it's so cool,
Great app I can cally friends perfectly but I accidentally logged out and I have the right password and email and it still will not let me log back in please fix this,
Downloaded to my kids tablets...android 6...it wont load just keeps crashing.... Hopefully it gets fixed soon so they can check it out,
Please fix; app doesnt work. All white screen then app closes itself. I will change my review once fixed.,
I can't see anything so I can't do anything or see where I'm going and now I have no more interesting games to play and I really liked it when I could see so if you could change that that would help,
"This is w really great app, but iPhones are getting more features earlier than Android phones. Please equalize the two OSs apps.",
"I love this app so much. I'm always on line and this is so much fun. Just talking and playing with my grandkids who are in WVa and I'm in Fl, feels like we are togther. I Love It!",
Doesn't work!!! No response either after weeks of trying to report technical issue. Same issue as everyone has stated below. üëé,
Android or Samsung cant pick out of there gallery they can only take a picture for there profile pic pls change that üòãIf possible. I also got loged out for some reason aswell pls fix have a nice day.,
Good for kids But the reason why I am giving 4 stars is because when I call somebody the screen turn black and shows colours only when the call connects please rectify.,
I love this app but when I had an iPhone I couldn't hear the people I was on the call with... and when my cousin called me on her tablet she couldn't hear me but overall its a really good app,
This is great because I'm able to talk to my friends and if some one says something bad it wont let that text come through ‚ô°„Ää„Äã‚óè‚ñ†‚ôß‚ô§{},
Very good and well there is like games on it aswell and you can talk to poeple on fasebook and who have the game super fun and esay to figur out i would say its great for your child,
I love messenger kids!!!!!,
Messenger kids isn't really that good I couldn't get on because of my mom forgot her Facebook password and you guys probably can do that too but you guys are just too weird messenger kids have all my friends from school on it and you guys are just weird,
this app is little bit werid because it keeps giltching when im talking to my friend but its still a good app for kids cause alot of kids don't even have iphones but im a laptop but its still ok,
I like the interface. It is very safe for my kids. I found it a great way to keep in touch with my kids! They are entertained and happy!,
"This darn stuff won't freakin work, it is always saying that there was an error while signing up.",
Really cool this app is really cool the only problem I have a sleep mode it's a really cool app I mean you can play or it's really fun for kids but I have is that a good time but when I wake up I get it early is a really cool app it's really cool really sorry you could call people you get message people you could just sit here or skyzoo down free kids but your parents happy find inmate because you everything you message it goes into sleep mode that's a lot of fun make sure you download this for your kids,
UGH..LOVE this app so so much it so cool me and my class mates always talk every weekends and its so fun like if you dont have class you can just chat with them right? So funüòÜüòÜ!!,
I love that my daughter can still talk to her friends when we move to florida. It helps very much and keeps her happy,
my daughter loves this app and i love that i can see and approve everything. perfect for a 10 year old. üòâ,
I love it when we can do things in messanger (adlults messenger)we can send pictures and voice chat video chat and more I make funny photos and send to my far away relatives it's really fun Just.....LOVE THIS APP‚ù§ I hope you download it!‚ù§üòÄ,
App is awesome cuz I can message my friends even when they live in a different state as long as I have Wi-Fi and activities to do is awesome,
Like this messenger kids app it is so cool I like how it has games and I can text my mom or my friends and it is a good way to talk to your parents and friends through this app.,
It is super cool but I can't seam to get the themes to work for me but overall it is a great communication for kids!,
I like this app its very good for your kids its really just like messenger i would like it more if you can change their nickname but its niceüòä.,
I love it!!! It's the best talking app ever and every kid should get it me and my friend Michael love this app!! Thx for making it!!!!üíØüíØüíØ,
"I love this app and I'm a kid but there are some things like 1.it sighns me out and I have to get my mom 2.there is a button to sighn in quickly but everytime I press on it, it says sorry something went wrong and that's annoying 3.most of the time I call somebody they can't see me or I can't see them. Messenger kids pls fix this it just signed me out right now.",
Tried to add my children. They have kids messenger and it won't let them send me a request and I can't do anything on the kids messenger if I even try to make an account it says failure... Their father has tried everything he knows to do and still nothing is working.,
"This app is awful, have no idea how to use and no where for help. I can't change my name or open messages",
The app is somewhat fine I just hate the fact that it is so colorful and you cannot turn your camera off in video chat without going out the app there is also more to my opinion but im afraid this is a pretty long text already. Please update it and I will change my review. You dont have to this is just my opinion and I doubt you will see my review.,
"This app is really really good for kids,but I think you need to keep the filters and not get rid of them,and please add more games.",
The messenger kids app is alsome for me and I don't like the update into the app. Can you cut off the update and do it if necessary. Still it is a alsome app.,
That is a awesome app for kids helps them learn to write read I like it and I can see anyone that's talking to my child and see every word there saying too so it's good that way u will know about a creep right away,
Its great for kides keeps what they say to each other friendly and safe! A great way for friends to talk.,
"Everytime I log in, it will spin and take me back to the log in screen. One device has it and one does not.",
This app makes me so frustrated!!!!! When i call my friend sometimes she can't hear ME! I might even delete this app and never use it. Unless you fix it.,
"This app is so good you can take picks with funny filters,do games and most of all during these times its a great way to comuncate",
When you call its extremely glitchy and it won't send pictures correctly they just turn up grey.,
Its good but whenever i try to take a picture for my account it says theres no internet try aguan later and i kept trying but it wouldn't work when my wifi and internact were on.,
Efficient but it slows down and tends not to work after you've had it for a while.,
The app works fast and is really easy to learn for those who do not have a degree in Tech LOL!,
Wont even create an account. Constantly getting an error message saying account creation failure. Please try again.,
Easy to get setup. Like having control and access to my daughter who is new to the phone and social media world.,
"Its so fun you can grow your pet you can ring messge play games whhen you are calling or not and you can mute your self i love this its the best you will have soo much fun you can text your friends,family and cousins i love it its sooo fun",
"I love this app so so so much it is great i can talk to my friends and mom and dad any time, love it. It never fails!‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",
the reason why I gave it three stars because it wastes is my battery and I really do my phone is always low and that's why I kind of like don't like it because it wastes is your battery and you may get it but it is a very very very good but it just raises your battery if you don't want anything to waste your battery and if you already don't have enough space then I would not recommend you get it but if you have enough space and I would recommend you get it because it is good for calling family,
Its a great app don't get me wrong but the filters could be a bit better more like the Snapchat filters.,
Cannot even finish setting up the account for my child... it keeps Cycling through the sign in on this devices page and will not go any further.,
"I got this for my Son so we can talk whike hes away or with friends, he has games recorded he can share, but otherwise, how long can 2 kids really just add stupid pictures of themselfs on the screen",
This app needs to be improved it has lots microphone problems lots of glitches hard to hear people I will give the app 5stars if the quality gets a lot better,
Does not work. Asking for parent login. Once parent logs in it just gets stuck in this loop of logging in. Horrible.,
I now can't login into my child's account from my (parent) device. I'm very unhappy about this security issue. Will rating change once fixed.,
"It doesn't even let me create an account it said ""something went wrong while logging you in"" then I click messages and sends me to messenger WORDT APP EVER I PREFER MESSENGER",
"My daughters coment: I LOVE this app!!!üíû‚ô• i can text my mom ,dad ,older sister ,ant ,uncle ,and all of my besties your parent has to have facebook.My mom always says that i am not aloud to get rugural texting apps but then i found messenger kids Yes! What i love about this app is that you can make group chats and there is cool filters for taking pitures and video calls! I toatly recomend mesenger kids thankyou so much who ever made this app!‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•üíûüíûüíûüíûüíûüíûüíû‚ô•üíû",
Tried to log in and it told me I didn't have a FB account under either my email or name... which are both my FB account logins and username.,
Fantastic .Nice. UI . Appears to be safer option w/ parental guidance. Nicely done!,
I have had This app for such a long time now it's like my favorite app on their I have so many friends on it and it feels like a really good app for if you're like little and you're not allowed do you have messenger awesome I don't know what else to say lol üòú IDK,
When I'm on call with my friends I can't olay games with them the screen glitches to black. So I be have to call on a different app,
"I love kids messenger so much because I can talk with my friends, I can call my friends, I can ask on kids messenger to add people, and most importantly you can have a ton of fun!",
"Parental controls needs a limit section on all calling features, including video calls. My children have tablets, not cellular phones for a reason.",
My child logged out and it's not letting them log back in we enter the details then it says logging out.. and takes them back to the sign in page.,
Keeps asking me to download the app. I have downloaded it and opened. I think it's installed but keeps asking me to download the app again.,
It won't let me log in. I have to keep putting in my password and it takes me back to the password screen.,
I love this app it's just so awesome I can text my friends and text my mom text my dad it's awesome thank you for creating this app and it's just for me a little kid I love it and when I have kids I'm definitely going to have them download this,
"I love texting friends and family in this app! I love the games that you made! Thanks for making the app, Makers!",
"It won't let me freaking chat to anyone because it say ""unable to send text message"" and I'm tired of it fix this please.",
This has been a very handy app so I can talk to my daughter. She can talk to friends while monitored by an adult on her own device and really no need to worry!,
I think it's a good app but you can't turn off your video and can't really hear the notifications sooo,
"Won't let me log in either child to their accounts on their devices, was great until they got new tablets and now they can't use the app at all",
Love this app!! But the only thing is that you can only send so many photos in 1 message but other wise it's amazing,
"I have tried both my husband's FB account and my own and it continues to say ""Not found"" so we can't even get started with it.",
"its good, but dude come on. i tried to make myself an account im (17) so i can talk to my little brother that lives in another state and i didn't know my email wasn't connected to fb tried to make an account and it DISABLES my email xc",
I love this helps me stay in touch with my kid as well as her being able to stay in touch with her friends! Especially during this time of social distancing!,
It is a very good app for kids my daughter used to have WhatsApp but now we have messenger wow it is very safe she only talks to friends and family no strangers thanks so much your app is wonderful wow bravo üëèü§ó‚ù§Ô∏èthanks for the app it is wonderful üëçüëçüôãBye,
It was very easy to get in to the apps and down load. I think it's going to be great thing for the kids to be able to contact each other.,
This app is amazing when I download it on my tablet my parents can watch why I do or say also I get to connect with people and it has cute face on the camera filters;),
I try to login to my Facebook account it wouldn't It shows incorrect password please fix it My daughter have been wanting to try out this about but now it disappointed her she's really sadüò≠üò≠ And I feel for her Please fix it I want the best for me sweet little girl (Ana) Please!üôèüôèüôè,
The app won't let me log in it glitches and go to the main screen to log in again highly annoying that I can't use this app,
Kid messenger just stopped working it won't let me log in nothing it just keeps sending me back to log in page. I hope they fix this issue soon,
"I Don't like that one MUST have a FB account to use this. Believe it or not, not everybody has one and I'm one of them. Uninstalled almost as fast as I installed",
"Set up my son zero issues , my daughters account next 45 mins later still not linked correctly . This app needs alot of work if simple linking is an issue.",
I am having the same issue as everyone else. I enter my password and it just keeps starting over. This sucks. It's good when it works properly,
Seems great but when we send invites to friends and/or family they are asked to set up an account for their child. That isn't quite what I was trying to do!,
Keeps logging out and won't show messages. No matter what I do I can't get it to give an alert when our kids receive a call,
Worst app ever when I'm trying to play a game with my friend my screen starts flashing black you can't even use certain emojis like the üî´ üî™ emojis can't even delete messages,
It's a good app but when I call my friends the screen goes black for short periods of time and it only happens when I call so pls fix it,
Awesome app but I think they should put some more stuff in it. I mean were kids we need entertainment!,
Great app for kids to have communication with friends or family. is easy to control who you want them to talk to.,
"Every Thing Is Great Like The Calling, The Texting, Every Thing Is Great. But The Reson Im Giveing This 3 Stars Is Because The Word Block Is Not Good LIke Swear Words Are Not Blocked,I Just Thing You Sould Have A Block Thing or An App For The Parent And They Can Block Words And Look At Text Just Saying This To Make This App More Safer And Better. Just Dont Go Crazy With Blocking Words If You Happen To Block Them Or It Will Get Anoying. Thanks For Your Suport!",
I liked this app snice when I was playing on the game with friends and my screen didn't go black now I absolutely hate the app cause when I'm playing my screen is always going blackü§¨,
I love this app! I use it to connect with my family and friends I have a little problem with my camera though but except that all of it is great!,
I like the app but just one thing there be more colors to decorate your app like pastel colors and colors of the rainbow other than that the app is very good ‚ô°‚ô°‚óá‚ôß‚òÜ,
bruh this app isnt downloaded on my phone but it shows up in my facebook folder randomly. when i press the folder the app disapears.,
Good app and all but the video chat needs to be full screen! And I dont like that you have to take a picture of yourself.,
"I keep getting ""account creation Failed"" message, and no matter what I do I cannot set up my daughter with an account.",
it is so amazing you can call and text it is so awesome everyone reading this should get the app it for kids with out phones can get this app for free parents are thankful for this you should be to!!!,
"Can it be less user friendly? Sooo many unnecessary steps to add friends to my kids account. Plus it says I have to add them from the app, which I have deleted since it also sucks.",
"It helps keep in contact, and track my kid's connections online! Does have some terrible filters though!",
Would be cool if it had basic games like tic tac toe and more fun filter without games. I feel like they are mostly just games,
It's awesome!!!I really enjoy how you can FaceTime and play slot of games and the draw and guess what it is game.,
"I thought that there was no messenging app for kids, but then my mom found one and now I can chat with my friends all I want, even in covid!",
"I loved it, it helps me talk with my friend that moved out of state. I never really saw her, but texting her makes me feel like she is still here with me and my friends. I miss her.",
My friend cannot hear the music on my side but she can hear it on her side. Love the app!,
"Terrible quality. Sound glitches out, blockyness, and it freezes a ton.",
Easy to use! Kids enjoy using the filters with their caller and taking pictures of their experience together.,
it is great to talk to my friends and you cans ee when they are talking to you and whent hey do talk to you you cna see if they read your message and you can make your own photo but my only problem is sometimes it will lag out,
"It's good, but I want to be able to introduce friends that don't know each other. Like a chat group, but for introducing people.",
I loved this app until my child got a new phone and we tried to set her up a new account but it won't let us.. we tried 10000 times.,
Nice appüòö‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Play store üòä,
It's really fun you get to see your friends when you can't see them cuz it's Corona time and it's really fun,
Yea its a great app but it won't let u pic a picture form your phone u have to take a picture n I don't like that one more thing I have a stepdad n they have the real messenger so I tried to add him but I can't bc I need a code,
I hate it because the super hero camera filter the screen turned black still heard the music I could see it faintly couldnt turn off phone I had to take out the battery,
"I love this app, but I HATE that you have to face time because a 10 pound stool fell on my head so PLZ make it so you can call not on face time and call on audio call.",
This app is great but the stupidity in it is filters and stickers I found out you can add blm in you're pics and vids like um why? This is an app for kids kids don't need to believe everything they see on the news don't drag blm in it blm is toxic as well don't drag blm in this,
"It's good but can be very annoying, and never notifies me unless I have the tab open. It's made me miss a lot of my friend's chats",
Great for letting my baby love communicate to loved ones that she loves to video chat with Absolutely great app for kids.... LOVE IT!!!,
It's a great app but for some reason I don't have an update that my friend does which had a new full style and different colours.,
"I think this really is a good messaging app for kids. Even though I am one, I think I would recomend this to other parents.",
"It worked fine then one day it just logged me out and deleted account, so I tried to recreate it and it didnt work.",
The app was working perfectly fine and now I'm having the same issue as everyone else. I can't log back in.,
"I love messenger kids.. There's only one problem.. I don't get why you can't delete the text you just sent.. If you could update that, I would be ‚ó°Ãà‚ãÜ‚íΩ‚í∂‚ìÖ‚ìÖ‚ìéüòä",
"It's OK. The main issue is that i am on a Samsung and i cant change the profile picture to anything in my gallery, I hope this gets fixed.",
The app when on a phone call you cannot play the games properly because it won't let the screen click.,
This app is awesome for kids this is so nice you could talk to your friends and you can do lots of other stuff like right stuff to each other but your parents can see this,
I love this app so much! You can text call and send emojis üôÇ. I recommend you download this app its THE BEST!!!!!,
"You don't get adds, there are mini games and nearly every think you can think of. You need to get this app!It's a dream come true.üíñüòòüòâ",
best app ever my kids love it and all the safety measures are awesome like i get to see there conversation and add people they can request people and i can accept if i want to but best app i rate it a 10000000/10,
100% consider it is a great app ive been using it for 4 years it is the greatest texting platform i have ever used,
"App is good, some improvements with the parental control side more access would be preferable",
I do love it but Sometimes when i log in i spell the right one i type my real password but it was error sometimes and i dont evenn like this app thay much so i dont use this a lot anymore,
I can't call my kids and they are sitting right next to me but they can call one another it makes me put in a one time pass code when I try to re add myself to their list,
This app is mind blowling üò≤üôä and I L IT BUT HER is a litter problem that it have a option That i can share my call wtpith another preson but whene i press the option thene it say (You cannot share your cell),
"Download this for my child and it won't even create an account, it just keeps saying error.",
Good in theory but won't let my child log on. Continues to show error messages.,
I can't get into it like it won't let me try again later I keep trying again later and it don't work y'all need to fix it please,
Very useful to be connected with your own kids in same way as Messager on Facebook.,
"This app is the best parents download this app for your kids, but there is one problem it gliches a lot they should fix it",
"I got a account a long time ago, and I would have deleted the app the second I got a phone number a few months ago, but I need to talk to my freinds without one.",
It is a good app but For entering the app I tried 3 times till it said okay! Soo that was the only problem can you fix it?,
For like 6 year olds is good but like 9 and up no. Messenger kids sometimes acts up and I personally don't like it,
Its a good app just when i call its dosent work when your off the app u get on notifications and to much space,
"It requires your facebook password like thats unneccesary! And stupid, who renembers their facdbook password!?!? To even get in the app",
It is where i like to talk to my friends and family onit is very usefull.,
I love kids messenger it helps you talk to my mom and my friends it's really good this is the best app I really have to call,
I love this app it allows me to use it and not worry about it being appropriate But I don't like that I can use a previous picture for the profile!üòäüòãüòéüòçü§ó,
Freezes alot but it's great for my children to keep in contact with their friends and grandparents during quarantine.,
Amazing app!! Such a safe way to text with your family and friends! I love it so much!!,
The only issue I have is the easiness to hang up... my two year old is something else when it comes to hanging up ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,
"super fun games;great chat,can send pics. (I would rate 10+‚≠ê if I could) no adds,and easy to use.",
Couldn't get past the start up screen. It just blinks the logo over and over again.,
i love it soooo munch i love using it to talk to my cousins and my friends and family members.i love the stickers they are so cute!you should download it too!,
I have had it. I keep getting bugs every day its so anoying and also when I try to text my BFF its keeps saying unable to send,
I have 2 of my children using this app and they love it so do I since I have all the control. A big plus is that the kids can't delete their messages,
This app is amazing. I can easyliy contact my freinds and family when ever i want. If i want to have a calling app it would be this!,
"Will not let me login on a device. After I enter in all my login info and do the two way factor, it kicks me back to the login screen.",
Unable to add grand parents. Keep getting errors telling me to try again later. Been months now. fix it please.,
I love how easy this app is and that you can connect with your family you just have to have a Facebook account and you can add people from your Facebook account to talk to the kids and its that easy,
never mind texting get this app for your kids it fun and amazing for them my kid loves it and always wants to be on it!!!1!,
The app is great. But I suggest there should be a feature where you can add other kids. So the kids could know what's going around the world,
"Most of the time it works very good. When I have had issues, it might be my internet or the other parties.",
I would give it a zero it used to work but now it just keeps going back through the set up process and it won't let me log in.,
"Parents should be able to delete pictures, videos and other stuff your child sends. Parents should also have more abilities to manage the account then whats given. FIX YOUR APP!",
I love this app it's so much fun to use and easy but at times it is a little glitchy like it freezes.,
"Same thing with all of you guys it's been doing the ""same"" thing all the time I would love to give this a five star, but nope, to many errors. Yeeesss you fixed it üòÄ",
It's good except I can't grow my pet. It just has a black background with a blue spinning circle,
I really love this app but one thing I need to tell u I really want the play mode when u get to play while u talk please add that I really loved it it's the best I can think of without it I'm bored so please fix this and add this because this used to be here and I loved it before u took it out so please fix this and I will give u 5 stars so please I'm begging you please,
my daughter uses this alot and thinks its a great app. I also think it is a great app. All parents should get it for their child.,
This app is awesome you get to text and call your friends (sometimes the calls glitch a bit but its fine) and there is games to play,
"Really need the ability to use headphones for video calls, it is ridiculous that this doesn't work.",
I can talk to my friends and do fillters,
Messenger kids is something for grown-ups and kids and it's so excited it's like the best game you ever tired in your life and you can do filters you can do different other stuff that you love to do you can even do pictures and something to everyone can't you do that yeah I can because there's so much fun excellent thing you can do it's the best game well it's actually not game it's the best messenger kids that they ever had I can't believe that it's really happening this is so excited I Loved,
You absolutely can NOT sign into this. It just keeps looping . Please fix this app as many parents use this frequently for their children.,
I love this app! Everything works beautifully and there is a wide range of gifs for little kids,
Have to download app for each child on a diff device. Cant have both children on one device as app only downloads once. Such a pain.,
"I love how parents can controll it but I dont like how kids can't name people like mom or bestie,or no fun ringtones.I love the app though it gives me/us kids to chat with family.",
Nice app. Can talk to friends. Would be good to use on the computer too not just a tablet.,
A great appi can call and text all of my friends without a phone number and I think they should update the app so you can call,
Loved it until the issue of logging back in became an issue. Hope it gets fixed soon.,
Such a great message app i use to talk to my friends all the Time but all the games suck so do the filters and you can't send links so it kinda sucks just get Snapchat tbh,
"Having trouble authorizing my son's new device. Used correct password and email, changed password to a new one, still keeps asking me to put in a password",
Its awesome you can facetime message your friends and family you can also use filters and post pics it really is one of my favorite apps,
I love the app it gives you time to talk to your friends and family as well you dhould trie this app and it's helpful that you parents can see it and it can be for parents ss well i love the app so much .,
Its a nice app its fun for kids to have fun playing their games like basketball/soccer thats all that i remeber so yeah guys hope you like the app its really fun its so fun but yeah play it have a great time umm....thats not all you also can talk on facebook to on this app so if you use facebook its a good app if your a kid and use facebook im onenof them so yeah i know whats its like if had the spp a long time ago so yeah i got to go so if you do get this app please make sure to like bye..üòÄ!,
I can't send gifs OR dark mode on Android but you can on iOS this app needs to be active with support and updates and not just forgotten they only did Android because they had to.,
I love it I can call and text my family and friends it's fun too I love the filters but can you make it to where you can type your own code? And also can ya make it to where you can set emojis to send like regular messenger???,
Why does it keep.saying the user(me as a parent) not allowed to login this app? I need to have my child's login device and can't do so if this error keeps popping up,
Would be easier to use if instructions were clearer. I am a new user age 61 and it took me 2 weeks to set up on my phone. Steps 1 through 4 didn't have a link to do the step.,
This app is great for kids (like me) to talk to your friends. But please add more colors:),
This app is so cool i have my mom friends Grandma and Grandpa my cousins and some new people this app is amazing and just so perfect for kids and im a kid that is typing and this is my experience to this app its it's amazing,
"There needs to be different versions according to child's age, mine is 15. This app is targeted toward younger kids. Regular messenger has zero parental controls. Why are there no settings available for this app?",
"It's a good app boy,the kind of creepy and like all the filters are really weird. It weird.",
App needs fixing asap... I've been trying to get passed the parent authorization page for an entire week to no avail.,
I downloaded this for my kid and he added a school mate who cussed him out talked trash and belittled my 8 year old. He then deleted his account which deleted the messages in my sons inbox. This shoulf be updated. I need to be able to see 100% of my childs conversations old new good and bad at all times.,
"The purpose I installed this app, was so I'm able to call my child... my problem now is that it only rings if he is in the app, if he is not in the app it doesn't ring... this is really frustrating.. can someone please assist??",
I really love Messenger Kids! I just wish there were more of her friends using it. Great controls for parents.,
This is a great way for kids that you dont want to have a real number.Its child frienly.I say this app is great to use for kids to text family and friends,
So about messenger kids I wish it wasn't saying connecting when it's actually calling and I need your child to hear youüòï and wanted to be how the screen's not all black so That you don't have to call them multiple times please let this problem fixed thank youüòÄ,
I love this app and I think it's a safer way for little kids to communicate with ou having phone numbers at there age until they grow up.,
I first opened the app and it told me to sign in with facebook and i do not have facebook. I really wanted to use it but its so sad it wont let me.,
Overall great app. There is a bug though. I can't chat to some of my friends it just says unable to send text. Please fix this. Other than that. LOVE IT! ‚ô•Ô∏èüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è,
It's a good way to communicate with my kids when they aren't with me without giving them phones. They can call or text me or other family members from their iPads.,
it won't open on my child's phone don't know what to do. I have already tried to uninstall and reinstall and still won't work,
"After logging out, I can't find the code to authorize the device. Is this a hide and seek game? It wasted an hour of my life figuring it out. üò°",
I have had a lot of fun with my friends like the face time is fun you can play games with whoever you are face timeing.,
Depending on the people it is really fun and there are some fun games although sometimes it is really slow,
If your kids are too young for messenger than this app is perfect they can find there friends and they can add people who have messenger,
Totally fun and you can contact anyone you want to even if they are in Europe and you're in South America you can still contact them totally recommend getting messenger kids,
You guys deleted my sons messenger accoumt writing another review i did not delete it i deleted the app and tried to readd it to see it that would work to fix the app but it wont fix the problem even reset phone completely and turned phone off an on,
I cannot get this app to work. I have reinstalled it. I have shut down my phone. My daughter is upset to not be able to use this app.,
Keeps saying error when opening and automatically shuts down. I want this really bad!,
It's okay but I won't show my messeges on my laptop and phone I'm writing this report with a Qlink tablet and It won't let me update it besides that it would be a 5 but only a 4 because of those reasons,
Great! I feel comfortable knowing that I can control who is added to my children's messenger. This is a great way for my child to keep in touch with me and her family members. I love it.,
It keeps saying unable to send over and over again... Its stressful even when you really wanna text your friend!,
I really wish developers would give me or restrict the number of rings on my app. Nothing more annoying than kids ringing for 20 minutes.,
"Wont work, everytime i try to create the account it says something about not being able to make the account and tells me to try again.",
Great for kids connecting with friends her age! I love that I have full control of who she chats too.,
"I love the idea but I've been trying to make an account for my child for two days and it keeps saying ""account creation failure"" so it looks like we won't even be able to use it.",
Does not give you notifications. I've made sure they're on and tested repeatedly.,
"I called my friend and she picked up no problem and we talked and there was no time limit and we played games together and I loved it,l!!!üëçüëçüëç",
It is really good and i love it i can talk to keely w and Marley b AKA my freinds and any kid would want this like look at that ill have to see how many people have this but but but but you see when you send to many things to some one then their screen gets frozen but any ways i love how you can voice clips and ummm yeah bye.,
"this app is very hard to use and its very buggy. 0/10 don't download it won't let me message my great great great great great uncle because he is supposedly 6 feet under. I'm so done with this app it also won't like me log in. pleas help I have been bawling up stairs for the past 10 hours. send help please I think there trolling me at this point like my uncle isn't even dead lol. if u don't fix this I'm calling the bbb, police, and ur manager. - love Karen",
"A good app BUT the old one was better ,I cant use some of the filters and can we please have some better games to play on video call also bring the poig game back",
The only thing I don't like is that I can't create a group chat for my children and their grandparents to chat and share updates of their lives instead of the folks having to message each one individually.,
"The app is good. Safe for kids. But when my daughter tries to open the app, it's suddenly went back to start.",
It's so great because my friends were one of my friends were talking me animates very great because she was telling me good things I was so much at all of these and even if that's why they call a messenger kids,
my favoret thing ever it helps me talk to all my friends but it is really easy for somone to hacke your account if you could fix that then that would be amazing thx,
I am only 8 years old and I LOVE this app it's Amazing I can talk to so many people and it's totally safe for kids 6 and up!you haft to get it!,
It would have been better if the kids could decorate the home screen. Other than that very good app.,
I guess it's good but I wish you could customize theame and stuff and update the app for once definitely for children tho. I gave this. (5 star's) üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,
"It won't let me authorize a new device, so the new phone we got can't use this app. Wide spread issue with no solution.",
I love it and all but the only thing I dont like is how some updates are only on iPads and I think that they should add it on phones to so that it's fair,
my 7 year old is just starting to want to talk to her friends amd family and this allows her to do just that and i can see everything. its amazing,
I had to Uninstall app and now it won't log back in. It's keeps asking for password but then doesn't log in. Terrible glitch.,
I like it but.... the notifications dont work. My friend was mad at me because I wasn't responding. FIX THE NOTIFICATIONS!!!!,
I hate this app it doesn't let me sign in. I am also noticing how other people are having a similar issue. Fix your damn app Facebook!,
It is really good for kids and there friends. I love seeing kids talking and texting there friends.,
"Me being a kid, this is the perfect app for low reception locations. Like the farm, or a forest.",
It is a little stupid because my friend won't talk to me since my birthday party which is in July give a 5 out of ten because my friend Zoe hasn't called me in a long time so that's why actually I'll give it a eight out of ten,
"Great app!! I only had 1 problem which was the grafics on video calls, Otherwise it was a great app!",
I love messenger kids! Although when you type :) it turns to üôÇ which I do not like. I have to type it like this : ) . Also when my friends send photos it does not show. Can u pls fix it?,
This is a great way to get your friends with you its save for kids its good when your stuck at home there's filters games video chat and much more,
"It is a very safe and fun app for kids like myself to use! Certain emojis are restricted, and your parent or guardiancan see what you are saying or have said.",
Whenever I try to contact my friens on call my Bluetooth headphones never work i dont know why thus happens but I dislike it very much and hope they would fix it.,
"I cannot log my child in on any device. If the problem gets fixed I will change my rating, but as of right now I am not even able to log in or anything.",
I love it me and my friends can talk any day of the week! Its the best texting app for kids!,
This app is amazing for kids! The only thing I don't really like is the filters.maybe some new ones?,
it's a great app but one thing to change on grow your pet it's the food because i use the honey now I been trying to pass it for weeks and still nothing please fix it,
I like how it is all set up but I feel like it could give the parent part more options and more say over the messages,
This app is not fun or creative or what ever am very sorry to say but am really angry üò§üò§ cos when i downloaded this app with wifi it downloaded and at the end of the day it didnt work i tried it both on data and wifi this app looks like a really cool app thats why i downloaded it,
This app is so fun somtimes glitchy and when you dont update it it does not work but other than that its perfect for your child to message safly,
We have only used it for two days so far but seems to be working great. My kid has no complaints about it she is all thunbs up.,
"Helps my daughter talk to me when she is at dance,girl scouts, friends house,etc. I love this app and strongly recommend it!",
"App doesn't work. Go to authorize account, enter password and it just goes back to the authorize account page.",
My kids love this app but is there a way to undo a rejected friend request because I accidentally rejected one for my kids and now I can't undo the action and neither myself or the other parent can send a new request,
For my kid she Loves to text her friends And she can tell them all the good and bad things. So this app is such a good app for your kids üéÅüéÅüéÅ.123,
Like this app. Can keep in touch with Hannah. I love that.I have not been able to keep in touch as much lately. But I do hope to soon.!,
It was good when I first started using it then it started not working every time I tried to call someone they would'nt get the call,
This app always puts my camera on the side of the screen I don't know if that's a technology thing but it's really annoying üëé,
"I just got this app and it dose not work :c When I try to open it it just blinks and goes back so I'm gonna have to give a 1 star in til you fix it,Ps sorry for then 1 star.",
Its really easy to set up an account and its a great way for other children to communicate during these tough times highly recommend it guys p.s this is a review from a 11 yr old,
WHEN I SIGN IN IT HAS A RAMDOM PERSON I DONT KNOWüò°üò°üò°üò°üò° FIX IT!!!!!!,
terrible i couldnt even open the app. :i payed 30 pounds for this messenger progam i could have gotten 3 primes for that amount of money it was absolutely discracfull.,
It is a really great app. I think you can call your friends and family members and talk. One problem is that it is hard for you to hear your friends.,
My kids love it.. I just dont like that it doesnt give me any kind of notifications if i have a message..,
I love it but the reason i put low stars is because you can improve by making you able to make a profile picture from your gallery i hope it gets fixed thank you,
"I love the app except for something that's been bugging me every time I try to send a message it says ""unable to send""",
It's very useful and my kid enjoy using it. At the same I can monitor who they talk to.,
great app. the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I am looking for an app. where i can see everything my kid texts on her app. through my phone.,
It's good for my 3 children and that I think is a good messaging app and I can see what my children say as well...,
Safe app for my 6 year old to call her family and friends anytime. Love that I control who is on her list and I am notified about who she has talked to every week!,
I love this app you can text people you can FaceTime people is awesome you should always down look this so if you if you download this you have a great time on it I hope you have a good day.,
"love this app, gives my kids the opportunity to use technology and stay in touch with chosen members. while not exposing them to the freedom of the net at too young of an age!",
Man this App is awesome it's great I mean I can talk to friends for free and it's super easy to set up!,
I love this app I can have my real life friend on there and I can text 5gem and call them or face time them it's a fun app I recamend this app!!,
Doesn't work after installing on new device,
App has crashed and caught in a loop. Needs to be fixed please. Was after a phone update I believe,
"I Don't Know How, But Whenever I Have A Call With Someone, When I Try To Do The Filters, I Try To Tap It, But Nothing Happens. It's Been Happening Since This Year Or Maybe Longer Than That.",
"Very good, I love this app all though on call the screen might freeze or glitch but other than that I onestly love this app...thank you!",
This app is awesome beside the fact that it hangs up the phone when me and my friend are in the middle of something but its awesome UwU,
As you can see the app is very good but the only bad thing is that when you call people it hang ups by itself but for The app is very good,
I like it but I put 4 stars couse in the middle of a facetime it randomly hangs up but other than that I like it thx soo much for creating this app have have a great day ‚ò∫,
its a good way to keep in contact (video chat or text) with my kids. love it. the best idea for kids yet...,
"When I try to log into messenger kids to authorize my device, it keeps saying logging out after i log in, over and over again. Please fix this!",
"I absolutley LOVE messenger kids but I have experienced a problem. So basically, I gave my phone to my little cousin and when I got it back, my friend was blocked. I tried to unblock her and I tried deleting then re-installing the app, but it would still show as deleted. I had to make a new account to solve this problem.",
it is great for annoying friends and contacting parents but you can't do a video just for fun.,
great app its a 5 star but for some reason it says were have trouble signing into Ur child's account ever time i try so i will love it if it just loges in. signed iris..,
"This app is very safe, and it has fun activities for your kids to do! Overall, it's the best messaging app for kids.",
"Great app for my kids, wish the option to add ppl not on your friends list (parents) was available though.",
I use this app a lot but there is a problem when u are chatting with a friend I might beep. I hang up and call back.another problem is that I might hang up when u are chatting.,
It did not work. I entered my Facebook and out my childs name then of course clicked great account and it didn't work. I'm very angry and disappointed,
"It's a great app for kids to talk on, and it is also monitored by parents to stay safe! I do recommend!",
Its fun and you can talk to your friends every day. Its so fun. Every one out there get this app. Its awsome.,
Fix your notifications,
This is the best app in the world and it stay close to friends and family it is kids safe. So it's just a good app.,
i cant send my own gifs i cant draw properly and after 15 minutes in a call it get silent theres poorly made filters.. i could go on but yk. fix your app,
"Im giving this a 4 star because I can text my friends and family, but it can be very glitchy. Another thing, now it won't let me text at all. Does anyone know what's happening?",
Can sometimes send multiple notifications for only one message but apart from that it's great.,
Its a great app i like to be able to text my friends sence im not aloud to have facebook but to creaters please let us be able to delete messages like Facebook Messanger,
Won't work anymore. Worked fine before now my kids can't use the app and it won't let me create a new account for them.,
It is a very good app if your not allowed to have real messenger you can still text your friends and parents and stuff think that you can also grow your pet and send photos,
This app is awesome and the best thing to communicate with my friends and parents but on the charger its not charger its not chartering my phone when this is open,
This app is amazing I love calling my friend I love texting them it's both pictures fun things and it's just so amazing.,
I like the app . It is so good for child . But could you make an arrangement for children to watch video together with their friend in group chat?,
I think this is a great app. It helps my son keep connected with his friends and family. It's been a great help during the pandemic.,
"I love this app so much, it is so easy to figure it out and I love the filters on it, and it is easy for me to talk to a friend that doesn't have a number ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ 10/10 recommend",
"My daughter loves it, keeps her connected to her friends but also controlled so no stranger can access her.",
"Great app for Kids, fun and safe to use. My son messages and calls me using all the fun stuff! Love it!",
"Messenger kids is great in a lot of ways, although when it says that my app went to sleep, and I go off the app, it will randomly pop up on my screen that my app went to sleep.",
I have 2 kids on this app and for some unknown reason I always have a problem with the same account. They need to fix this asap.,
this app is good and stuff but when you call someone the layout is weird so can you make the call layout exactly the same as the normal messenger adults use?,
Great app except it won't allow adults that are on my kid's accounts send giphys or gifs or even stickers at times even if they are kid appropriate.,
"I can't even text anyone because my dad can't log in. No matter how correct he puts in his password the stupid hick thing says It's wrong!! I hate this app so much. Until it works, I hate it.",
Keep getting an error when I try to authorize my device and it just keeps returning me to the same authorize device screen.,
The BEST app for kids (but) you can NOT do the same face emoji like for example a unicorn ü¶Ñ face you can NOT do if you and your friend live far away you can face time BUT you can ONLY video chat not hearing each other BUT you can see and hear each other Please like if you like üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüß°üíôüíúüñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§ü§çü§çü§çü§çü§çüíó‚ô•Ô∏èüòÅüò∫üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíúü¶Ñüëå:-)üê∞üê∫üê∂üê±üêØü¶Åüêºüêπü¶äü¶ìüê¥ü¶ñü¶éü¶ïüêäüêçüêáüêàüê©üêïü¶ÆüêÖüêÖüêÜüêéüêñüêÑüêÇüêÉüêèüêëüêêü¶åü¶ôü¶•ü¶òüêòü¶èü¶õü¶íüêíü¶çü¶ßüê™üê´üêøÔ∏èü¶®ü¶°ü¶îü¶¶ü¶áüêìüêîüê£üê§üê•üê¶ü¶âü¶Öü¶úü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶ÖüïäÔ∏èü¶¢ü¶©ü¶öü¶öü¶öü¶à,
"It is a great app, I seen lots of reviews about glitches and stuff but nothing is wrong with mine accept I dont like the facebook password thing.",
this app is so cool I definitely reccommend it. You can also three way! I want to facetime my friend ava all day.,
This needs to be fixed when i send stuff to people like a video it sends to someone else i will give 5 stars when it's fixed!,
ITs really good for kids but when you text someone just up the street it takes like all day to get the text to them,
It wouldn't let me text my mom and like 75 percent of the time it doesn't give me notifications or doesn't ring but other than that it is good,
I like it it is basically another version of messenger but for kids one thing tho when i face time my friend the call gets a little laggy and shuts down for like 2 seconds pls fix,
It really fun and over lockdown i can call me friends but i would like if you could unfriended people. It has no ads.,
Well I know doesn't have to do a five-star but I'm going to have to give this messenger case if I saw because me Savannam because I know everyone likes it but you have to like it because it's really funny she text me please get funny stuff on it and you have to like this I get it five star cuz it's the best one do it because I want you guys like you guys okay it's not but I want it and I like it because it's the best thing games SpongeBob and other people's game,
One of the games is riged you cant bet it but other wise it is a good app but do not play the zombie/pig game you glich out befor you can play the last block!!!,
Such a life saver and a great way to keep in touch with long distant family member! I would highly recommend this app!,
great and very addicting since this quarantine is going on it's easier to to to to talk to my friends then just being stuck inside so it helps me out a lot,
Very good on my phone and tablet and it's pretty good and I love it it's pretty good for my child and I love it cuz he can talk to his friends Henry Nolan and I believe Hudson Canton,
Its so good my my daughter loves it so much also can make it to make groups so that don't know who the other person is. But it is awesome üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,
Cannot add a friend for my child. Keeps showing 'Pending' and their parents don't get any notification.,
It helps you contact your parents when you need them the most but the problem is that it needs to have connection to every place bc you don't know if it could happen in a alleyway.,
"I dont have everything, like when I am calling, I don5 have an option to turn my screen off. But other then that, I love it",
"Its okay. Although it's not fair that you can just force contacts for your child. Its very restricted, which is ok.",
The app sucks to much bugs and viruses you need Facebook to log in which is very dumb because if you can't have Facebook this app is very useless the app is very confusing thank you for reading this comment!,
Great fun app but when I get the notifications it's always late so when I get a message it would be a hour til I get a notification.,
This is a good way for friends and family to connect with kids. It is also safe for when people ask to be friends with your id they run it by the parent first.,
"It is soooooo fun, i play on it all day every day. It is also very fun although it took an hour to download uhhh.!!!!",
"I love this app, my girls can communicate with their older siblings and cousins. The only flaw is that I can't make a complete family group chat with my girls (it seems like each person needs to have a messenger kids account to bring everyone into a group chat)",
"Unable to create account for my kids, keep getting create account error. Very frustrating.",
"The best for kids but they need to add more things like more colors, themes and more... I rate it a 5 star",
"picture quality is not great, seems to be working, glad I can connect to family and friends.",
this is a great app overall. the one thing that i dont like the most is sleep mode but this app can still be amazing when it works properly,
Good App But Try To Make It More Easy To Understand For Kids And Specially The Ui Interface Is Not Good Like A Professional App. There Should Not Much more Things Like Cartoon Etc. Taking A Lot Of Memory.,
Good app for calling friends but it keeps saying unable to send qitch sucks and is always glitches out would not recommend much I only use it cause my friends are on it,
"Im so excited for this app. Im a everyday, almost every hr user of messenger. So for me it's great to be able to connect with my grandchildren. All 10 of them",
It is really good,
"I am one of the children that use this app, but i am on my moms play store account... I love the app anf evrey thing! But i have one question... Could u plz let the older kids use bitemoije... I would love to use it text my best freind and have some fun and play around! Plz do this in your next update...",
Its ok but needs more filters and the emojis dont work on you face and they should let you pick a friend like when you first get the app,
Its amazing I have a friend who is moving schools and now with this app will make me be able to talk to her.,
"Love this app but it is not logging in, doesnt let the parent authorization go through. I can loggin easily on the ipad, or even adroid phone but not the tablet.",
Messenger kids is so fun because if u can't see your friends you can text each other and call them.An I'm only 10 and it's so fun.,
I like this app alot because if you don't have a phone and you would like to talk to your friend s durring the week or dering the corona this is the bet app possible.,
This is so awesome to be able to have my daughter call me anytime or anyplace. She is to young for a phone so this is perfect for her and me.,
Is an amazing app it's just amazing bro I love it I mean there is one thing that I don't like it's just that the monsters and stuff I think they really creep me out.,
I like that the app is very kid-friendly. All you need to fix is that only one child can have one account.,
Messenger Kids app is way better than messenger here's why. You can play games alone or with a friend. You can talk with anyone and video chat with them . That are no adds . This is why messenger kids is a better app than messenger.,
Ive tried multi times to create an account for my daughters and ever time it says there is an error. garbage app!,
Well to be honest I don't got any children running around and using laptop or phone a computer so no trouble with children messaging are texting one another they all stay one place with their school work okay thank you,
"Hey there messenger kids! My app is working perfectly and I know why my dad's messenger account won't show up. I'm not going to tell because well, this comment is public so I won't talk to much about it. But besides all that this app is still really good.",
I love this app.üòä It works great for my daughter especially when her phone is off then she can call me or video chat with me on the messenger.,
Really good app but my friend can't send me any more messages pls fix üòäüòäüòä and can you make a poppet game and bring back old filters thanks for your time,
"disappointed that the games in regular messenger are not here for the kids. my son loves to play all the games, which was the main reason I downloaded this for him, so he could play the games against family and friends",
Instead of allowing me to friend my grandson who friend requested me. It's asking me to open up an account for him and be the parent or Guardian. He already has an account under his parents and they have allowed him to friend request me. I have sent messages to Facebook to no avail. It's crazy that I cannot accept a friend request from my grandson and has created this new account for him as though i am the guardian or parent. I have no way to delete this or to accept his initial request,
This kids app is good but I cannot share my screen.üòê And that is kind of disappointing. But I still like this. I don't understand where is the update...,
I love being able to monitor my child's contacts and messages. I do wish I could see the messages from my device. Maybe even in real time.,
I just got tablets for my two kids and its not compatible. Really disappointed it needs to be compatible with more devices,
It's so fun you can face time all your friends and family you can also add friends and play games to.,
It's the best way to keep an eye on your kids here online. Love the fact that we can help the learn social media and help keep them safe.,
"Like several others,the sign in process is a never ending loop. I have also reached out to FB; I have yet to receive a response.",
It's a great app but I can not log back in to my old account or even go in to it at all fix this please I have no other way to text my sister,
This app is amazing I really think that your kids should have it they can talk to friends and family!!,
Its good but they √±eed to ad a map so you can se we're your friends are like snap chat and secondly you need to add a story to it,
I love this app it give me a chance to text my friend that don't have phones but it is weird when I tap the grow your pet thing it won't let me do it.,
This app is better than real messenger I can text all my friends and have cool colors. It's better than social media,
Can't get it work repeatedly. Says app went to sleep and does not give me any option to reopen it wake it up.,
I love the app but I have a problem with the app 1)when I call my bff and when I play roblox with her whenever I put my hand over the screen it turns black ‚ö´ so I hope you can fix that,
I can not make an account when i try to it goes back to the loading page its been like this since may i really need this app to work..,
It is amazing but just one tiny request can I have a camera off phone call and that's it but after all I love it and can we have nicknames for friends and family,
"Since I updated it, the video call keeps crashing and I can't see the other person it gives me a black screen",
Great its a fun way to text or call but it has alot of bugs that i wish that can be fixed but its fun over all,
It's ok I'm just disappointed because it keeps on logging out for my kid and it's getting really annoying but other than that it's the best app üê±,
Been having the same issue as everyone else. This has been going on for about a week. Went to website and reported it. Still hasn't been fixed üò°.,
The worst app ever could not even sync with a Facebook account. So bad I would give it a 0/15 but that is not possible so I give you a 1/15,
"I cannot believe that messenger KIDS sends me ""reminder"" messages at 1:45AM. IN THE MORNING!!! Imagine waking up to that notification. Unacceptable!!!",
it is very simple once you set it up you can chat with your frinds and family but the only downside is that you need inernet to video chat,
This games this thing sucks whatever it is I tried getting this thing away from my job I did everything I could but the thing is it would never send said I count failure my kid is so sad now cuz he can't talk to his friends I hope you get this fixed and if this is not fixed this will stay one review forever,
The app works great but I couldn't get notifications to work when my child received a message.,
"I like the app and I call and message people all the time, but i can't install it on windows.",
App worked for months. Endless log in loop. Please produce patch to fix the bug!,
"Cannot log my child back into their account, it finds my account no problem, put in password for my account, click login then it loops back to find my account over and over.",
My daughter loves this app! Great way for her to talk to her friends and family! And I love that I am in full control of who she talks to.,
"I love this app! I talks with my friends & family a lot, & since Covid, I have been talking to my family, & friends more often! üòÑ ‚âßœâ‚â¶ # GIVE IT 5 STARS!!!!!!",
Messenger kids is a great app but it appears to me that it immediately says that I have no connection even though I have good WiFi . Can you fix this?,
Its perfect for kids under the age of 14 and its easy to use. Perfect for kids with no phone number! I would highly recommend it!,
This app is great for kids. Our son loves it and we control everything right from our phones.,
it's a good app but for me i can't call my friends or family and then one day it just dissapered and i't won't let me install it again. PLEASE fix this. thank you :).,
This is an amazing app and my kids can text safely you are allowed to see their text and pick what friends they can have 10/10!!,
I can talk to my friend that's moving,
I like it it's fun. But also I dont like that you can just face time. Wanna call or face time,
"Set up for grandkids in guest mode. Seems to do things well, and they love it.",
"It is facetiming for kids you can grow your pet, and play games! You can also text! And you can have your own profile pic and take funny photos!",
Fix the problem with videos not playing more than a second or two!!!!,
This app is AWESOME!!!!!üíñ It lets you chat with EVERYONE that you send an invite to. There are no words to explain how much I love this app!üòç,
Easy and safe to use. I monitor everything and everyone my child talks to. Best thing ever invented.,
This is a grate app you can add people call them and it is good for kids they can text and call this i even use it for my own messenger it has cute activities it is such a good app you should download it üòä,
love it. i can keep in contact with my kiddos and monitor what they are doing. and video chat. highly recommend!!,
It's good but some times I can't log into my Facebook account not good at all really bad some times. I rate this two star because of that and there was no forgot password option,
I love this app it's so much fun to text and facetime your friends or family that lives far away!!!,
I love this app it is kid friendly and needs adult permission to send links or to add friends they know if you block them or unadd them and can chat with my friends,
It needs an update. It wont let me text and randomly kicks me out. A d the calls suck! Pls fix soon so I can continue calling my friends,
"Great App, my son is able to talk to his friends and family and I can check that there is nothing being said or done wrong...",
Great for kids you can also look at what your child is texting and my daughter love's how you can grow your pet and love's chatting with her friends and facetiming with her friends,
This app is bad it doesnt work it akways says that problem creatimg your account ALL THE TIME i reinstalled it but the same PLEASE HELP!!!!,
the kids love having their own app that they can keep in touch with people. They really like being able to see the person their talking to.,
This app is the best and I love but when you change the color of the app I want more options for color like black pink and white,
Keeping my granddaughter safe while she learns to use the internet is very important to me. Great app!,
"Love it! Especially now that you, As a kid, can send friend requests. Recommended!",
This app is amazing! Over quarantine my kid was missing her friends.One easy install and she can facetime and text!,
Frustrating! It keeps telling me that my fb account is not valid. I can't get it set up!! please let us know what is going on!!,
"Terrible app. It is always disconnecting and lagging, if you want a good calling or texting app use discord or something like that. Not this!",
"Great app to talk to friends, but it just randomly ""uninstalled"" itslef, it was on my home screen and it still said that it's not downloaded",
"Bad because issues with black screens and screens going often on, so I recommend you to get another one, and it's not this kid thing",
The app is good it just doesn't work on the sound no more .. why ? Dont know. . Tried everything but nothing works ..!!,
I use this all the time and i love it! You can chat with your friends and family! And you can teust it but i really do recommend it!,
Experiencing the same login loop issues as others have mentioned. Incredibly frustrating,
Bug!! It keeps changing my account to my daughters so i cant txt her because i txt my own phone. It is very buggy. Come on guys!,
Really cute app.. I downloaded it so I could play the games with my nieces and nephews and so that the little girl that i take care of can chat with them too,
It is a very reliable app it helped me when i could not talk to my friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
"Great app for kids. My nine year old son can ""talk"" to his friends easily. It is easy to use and is one of our most used apps.",
My notifications won't go off at all anymore doesn't even have the shortcut anymore or it's doesnt make a sound at all,
Great app but would live to send GIFS and bitmoji to my daughters and keeps saying app does not support it. Don't know how to fix it!,
This game is amazing i can talked with my friends it was so fun! You can talk with your mom friends family and you can see them to face to face this game is amazing AMAZING,
its a great app for my daughter to talk to her dad and all her other family members. We are very saticfied with it,
Will Not allow me to create an account for my child. Constantly getting an error message. What's the point when you can't even make an account,
"cant add my childs friends even after confirming, complicated to use. i dont want to use the facebook app and i shouldnt have to.",
This is a good app. It provides a lot of security procedures to maintain the safety level for kids. I love to be with my kids so it is just a good idea to come up with.,
It did not put a link for the app on to my phone. I have to come back into the play store to open it.,
"This is the only app I can have in my phone. It takes up so much space, I use it to talk with my cousin who is in the service in texas",
It wont send my messages,
"My daughter's father already has an account set up for her and it won't let me accept her as a contact. So I accidentally created an account for her on MY account and can't delete it now. This app is way to complicated. Why can't I accept my daughter's ""friend request?""",
I love the app but sometimes it glitches and I can't call sometimes but everything else is fine and my friend have these problems to,
Worked well for months. Suddenly it won't allow only 2 of my kids to open the app on any device.,
It is so good for me to text and call my friends and family and it's so easy and the great emojis I love messenger kids.,
I can't update it,
Brutal!!!!!! Connecting siblings is an absolute nightmare!! This app was definitely not designed through the lens of parents!,
I love using this app it's great and all but the only thing idk if it's just my wifi but the games load forever and on anyways I highly recommend this.,
this is great and fun i get to call and text my friends all the time has games and is great for kids at the age of 6.,
"I LOVE THIS APP!!!! i can talk to my friends and family, it's so awesome!!!! but it has some problems but other than that it's okay!",
I love the app! a the only issue is they can play the games like uno on regular messenger. Either way amazing app!,
Succesfully created account for my kids at first but now always login failure. Damn this is annoying.,
It's a great app because your kids can play games and talk to there friends. There are no adds:),
So far so good. Already making great improvements for communicating with family and friends during this pandemic,
its is amazing all the pictures and vids you can make whith the filtter like snapchat. But the only flaw is sometimes it types stuff for you and its a lil werd.üëçüëçüëé,
It is a great experience but unfortunately my kids has had a few problems like they can't use filters they can't tap sometimes and that's all really,
It has to many bugs I can't watch videos without it loading for a hour but on the bright side I can talk to my friends,
"My children love this app! I love it also i can see what my children are doing on the app, And its 100% Kid Friendly!",
"Ok it bad I can,t even create an account when I press create it says to try again I do it still doesn't let me In and your mother or father has to have to Have Facebook if not you can,t use it maybe it should have other things like email or phone number to sign in not just Facebook I hope this changes",
Pretty good because I get to see my friend when their on and we can show pictures and videos of cool stuff and things about are lives.,
Can you pls git rid of that random black screen when something is close to the camera it's really annoying.,
Not worth it! This app is Garbage I tried to add my friend to it and it was a whole thing and it still says we're waiting for Teresa to approve it's not worth it Patrick just thinks its cool it's actually lame and broken please fix this you need to make you're app actually good,
Couldnt accept the link my daughter sent. Gave me password problems. Kept trying to make me a page. Even still i did everything the app asked & Weve still not used it. We use Duo Chat. ‚ù§üåπ.,
Awesome app to talk to my friends and no ads EDIT 6/15/21 All of the sudden none of my contacts can hear me please fix this I rely on the app to talk to my parents when needed,
Its a great app!I can use it anytime and it will not let me down no matter how far my calls go!Im very happy that this app was created.,
I love this app bc i can text my cousins bc they can only have this app and it is so nice and i can facetime them the cant have the other messenger bc creepy peolple on it and they think it is someone else and it means if they give the people ur name and where u live thay can do something bad to u and u will not like it so this app is the best,
Amazing! I can text and call my friends! And there's little games in it every time I'm on it I laugh and have fun with my friends!,
I love to talk to my friends. But some live far away. So use this app to see and talk and message your friends.,
Keeps saying not able to create account I've already tried uninstalling I've already tried to login with my email or my phone and it's still not letting me create it,
My son absolutely loves this. He was able to connect with friends during the pandemic but uses it now just the same.,
no way to prevent child from group messaaging. more notifications than regular messaging making it accessable for child to message adults who are at work.,
It is really fun my kids love they talk to there friends all the time and when you exit the app the call keeps going so my kids play roblox with there friends and still be in the call,
I love this app it is easy to use I apsulutly love the auto but sometimes the auto is were u can not here the other person.that is the only thing I would change abt the app.,
"I used to like it, but my daughter just got a new tablet and had to put my Facebook on it to make it work. And put in a new password. She says that was only temporary, but I'm not sure.",
The thing is that I cannot update this app so it is hard to get on and please if the owner is reading fix this so I can update this app and actually use it!,
"This is the most amazing app for my child to communicate with her and his friends and family, I recommend everyone to downloadüòäüòÄüòåüòè",
I love being able to not only speak with my great granddaughter but I can see her also. Technology is getting better all the time.,
this game helps me if I need anything I call my mom with it a can text my mom my sister and my nanny and art it's a good game there are emojis when your texting you can make a huge thumbs up so cool there's games in the game good game,
I love it the kids can talk to their friends without using my phone to talk friends moms and telling them to give the phone to their kids aka their friends but when you text someone to much you can't text them for the next hour,
It's a very nice app that children can use to talk to their friends from far away.It's very very fun.üëç,
I cant view it because google is running interference! Someone has hacked my google account and I can't get into it!,
"I like this app, the reason I gave this 4 star is my best friend doesn't have a chat button in call so we have to end the call to even see my chat while in call, please fix this",
Does it is the best because I haven't got to talk to my cousin and so long and now I'm able to talk to her everyday that's why I love messenger kids and I agree for everybody to try this app you guys can play fun games in Springfield. Send text Harlem talk to them funny filters oh yeah you guys need to download Messenger kids I will give it a five star how to make you guys download it you have kids or you're like a grown up or something I don't know you will fall in love I promise,
"Horrible app, doesn't work properly. It keeps making everyone create account instead of just adding them.",
"After a year of using the app, we are no longer unable to sign back in. Been an issue for 3 weeks now :(",
The app very good and stuff but can yall plz add a part where u can post stories like on Instagram for only the people on your kids messenger to see or photos.,
very very helpful because i do not have data only wifi and i can talk to my friends safely also funny face filters and they get new ones each day,
"No ads,and good for kids mabey 7-12 in age.really easy to use,I really like this app.when I use it it need wifi/internet but idk if other people need wifi/internet.",
Tried 5 different times to get this to work for my child but it wont even get past their name and birthday. Always says something went wrong and to try again.,
I love it I use it 247 to text my friends or call friends and family and it cool but it cool to you add family form Facebook or. Friends,
Kid gets to call people that's near that safety who she knows,
Can't download? This app keeps doing a loop to login. Very annoying. Won't login.,
Great app. Can't seem to find the voice call option tho. Only video call.,
i like it but it only works on phone and tablet i downloaded it on my computer and it did not work it said it it downloaded but i could not see it if you could fix this that would be awsome,
My kid loves this app but they should explain the games and for the castle one they should give you more time and let you grab more blocks,
It really works and I've had it for a couple months now and you get to make faces everyday you unlock it's amazing,
I can talk to my friends and when you get off the app you are still on the call so you can play games with by my opinion I highly recommend this app as a five star app You should download it soon,
it was great but should have a time limit an amount of calls they can get or make. my grandaughter kept calling an it was sweet but got annoying.,
I would actually like to give this app a zero star rating. Worst app ever. Fire everyone who ever worked on this app and go back to the drawing board.,
Horrible. I can't even get the app to work to make my kid one.and there's no one to help me fix the problem.its really starting to make me mad,
so very disappointed with this app it won't even let me activate my child's account keeps telling me no account t found.. I've tried for 2 days now!!,
This is the best app ever!!! My daughter loves it because it is so cool it is really for kids. My daughter is enjoying this app.,
"Fun while it lasted :( I created an account for my son today and logged him out when he was finished. Now no matter what we try, no device will allow his account to log in. We've tried on two separate cell phones and a tablet",
LOVE IT! When I looked for some of my friends almost every one of them had this app! And I made some new friends! 5 OUT OF 5!,
It's really nice especially during quarantine cuz you can chat with friends and family.,
Disappointed because the app just loops back around to the login. Same trouble as listed below.,
Can't login. Endless loop that keeps asking for login. Numerous reports about this. Please fix!,
It is so fun I love it i have tons of friends and family on it something I would suggest for about 8 and older.,
This app is not for the parents and super hard to navigate and figure out as a parent. Very frustrating.,
"I cant download it to my childs computer, the only option it gives is an old tablet and my phone. Id really love to download to this pc.",
I'm so mad I'm trying to go in but all it does is blink black for like 2 seconds in then logs me out so I give it a 1 star. P.S. please fix it!,
This app is very nice for kids to talk to their friends and family along with fun filters and different games and growing an pet.,
I love this app! It's great for when I want to FaceTime my friends or family! I practically use this app every day!,
"So normally it works ok. But when my kids were messaging me yesterday, there was a breakthrough call from an Asian man yelling at them. He wasn't speaking English, and he was saying things inappropriate. I always thought this was secure!",
You should get this app because you don't have to go to let you know text messages because you could just text your mom or your dad on this and it's pretty fun it's fun emojis and stuff I love this good get your camera on and it's like silly faces like that and it's so fun and you can color so I think you should get this and you could text your cousins or sisters whatever you like,
Really great!! I us eit all the time cause I'm too young to use really meseenger and it's perfect!!,
Good app but after android update in app video chat games u can't play them but work before the update I know cause one that carried in to new update use to work don't even work after update,
"Won't let me add more people. Keeps saying error as occurred please try again later, been trying to add my grandmother and brother to my daughter's app and won't let me.",
It's really cool because you can FaceTime and talk and add pictures it's how I grew messenger and you can talk to your friends,
I love this app. It helps me comunicate with my friends family and even make funny faces while doing it I recomend getting this app for your children,
It's a good app! But can you make it so we can save video shown when sent? (The parents being alerted too just incase!),
"Very Glitchy, won't allow family members to be friended. Keeps giving error message when trying to approve sister.",
Great app only problem I have is i can't flip my camera I had it be for on my old tablet I don't now why pls see if you can fix if you fix it I will rate 5 stars,
Ok I've tried to sign up over 47 times! Nothing works there was an error everything! Pls fix this soon!,
"Just like everyone else says, I log in and it immediately says logging out and sends me back to the log in screen.",
"Worked fine before, but now won't let my daughter read any group chats. They open and close again immediately. Doesn't work.",
Good app but it is better if a child can upload a photo custom from gallery because they captured lots of good pictures on phone camera occations like eid pahela baisuakh they had a wish to put it on messenger profile picture on their messenger account actually it is my child's wish but you have to make sure somebody has not able put wrong pics like sexual abusive or something if somebody misusing the app & that'll make the app nore safe & enjoyable & fun & more explosive to the kids,
"Super cute app for kids. Lots of fun stuff to enjoy! Super like! Thanks facebook team, another achievement guys! üëç",
Awesome because I love how it is for kids but if I had to change one thing it would be so the kids can do the poop emoji üòÑüí©üëª it's not that bad,
"Its ok, the connection is pour and it will not let you change your profile name wich annoys me.And you cant serch people not even people on messanger kids, you cant add any one inless you know there code. So i wish it could be where you just tipe in there name to friend them Other wise its okay.",
I love the app so much it's so fun with the effects on the video calls whoever give this app a 1 they will have bad luck for 500 years,
"It is excellent! I love how you can talk with your friends, and I also love how you have parent supervision, so if someone makes you feel bad you don't need to be nervous about telling them.",
Same issue. Can't log on. Please fix your backend so we can enjoy the benefits of the front end.,
This app is ok i guess but i almost never get notified of new messages which is a huge problem.,
My kids only got to use it for 2 weeks. Then it just crashes. Will not work at all. I've done all steps possible.,
Everytime I try to log in to this app it keeps taking me back to the log in screen and will not work,
I have a kindle fire it keeps installing on the phone and i don't want that. It doesn't even have this device as an option. So mad,
This is a really good app my daughter can talk to children and her friends a lot and also added as me as her parent and lets me see her contacts,
amazing app but why when someone sends something it doesn't give a notification?but in other things its a great app thats why i give it 5 not 4 stars but plz fix this bug,
Well its cuz if u have to parents u need to be able to text both of the sides of family without having to know their password and email but otherwise I like it,
Easy to invite friends. Can take care of your pet. Can take silly pictures! Totally tell anyone to get this app.,
perfect for our lockdown right now...... lol. my 6yr old is able to connect with her friends. :),
I think it's stupid that you have to be friends with a parent in order to friend a child. I don't want to have to friend my ex in order to be on my childs Facebook messenger. Facebook needs to fix it so as long as the parent approves the adult can be on the childs messanger. I do not get a long with my daughter's father and I don't want him to know about my life but I want to be able to talk to my child on messenger.,
"New to this app, I'm still learning. I do very much enjoy getting calls and messages from my grandchild.",
"I can't get past the first screen. If my phone number and email address don't exist, I don't know how the hell I'm on Facebook right now. Very poorly designed app.",
"Hi, I love this app its a great way to communicate with your loved ones from far away's, but it is glitchy some times",
I cant create an account. Only gives error message. Deleting app. Waste of time.,
The grow your pet won't work. other than that it's great! I would make it 5 stars if the pet thing would load...üòâüòâ,
"Unable to have second child on same device. First kid enjoys it, but second kid is left out.",
I like it because you get to talk with friends that are not there with you. The camera's and other stuff on there is fun.,
i like it because i can control who they talk to and I can time limit them on it. the only thing that I would change about it is that I wish I could see conversations and see what they're talkin about. That's why I got only three stars.,
Can't get the video to work I even tried to download it on another device. Why is the video not working?,
I don't have a phone but I have always wanted a phone so I could text on it but I realized that I can text on this really safe app and you can also face time people on this app too,
Great app overall but I don't get many notifications like on my birthday I had many missed calls and messages!,
My 5 yr old loves talking to his friends and family on....i would recommend this app to any child it is cute they think they are like us...,
With isolating my son became lonely. With kids messenger he meets with friends daily and even creates groupps to play games. Its been a great help!,
This app has been great for my 12yr old daughter. They go above and beyond to ensure your child has a safe social platform to keep in touch with their friends and family.,
Well its a good app but its not fair becuz u cant share your screen like the messenger not kids so i would like you to update this and add the share screen button and add the chat head bucuz if we videochat while playing our devices lag so it would be better with a chat head so we can chat while playing i would make this a complain,
Same problem as everybody else. It's an endless loop of trying to sign in only for it to not work.,
Love the app! Both my daughters love it as well. they love chatting and playing the games.,
The app says unable to send messages the app is a little disappointing but the app works great a little bit..............,
Sends texts right away without any delay. But some of mine couldn't be sent.,
it doesnt let me create an account. Its a bad app,
It is good but there are some glitches like with calling like my screen goes black and it goes all wack.,
I found it sends stuff petty fats when I text friends they see it like in 30 seconds and I see there feed back in like 1 min.,
My child loves this,
"It won't let me create an account. I just keep getting a ""somethings wrong"" pop up.",
I think it is good for children so you can see what they are texting and you know who the are talking to would recomend .,
My kids love this app...but it is being super annoying on both tablets by requiring the adult to reset up the accounts everytime. Simetimes it boots the kids out while they are using it,
The app is OK. Sometimes it doesn't let me answer when my child calls.. the video chat works pretty good,
its a great app to talk to friends and family I think what would make it even more better than it is right now is maybe to add no face cam And you can think about if you want to be on cam or off I use this app to call my bffs and play roblox with them,
"I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!üå∑its an awesome new world for kids it's an amazing experience,.",
This is amazing this app is like messenger but for kids my to daughters have it and they are one it all the time so I canchsve my peace well there in there rooms and talking on the phone,
It is great appart from when it kicks me out of the app I highly recommend it for kids any age it is very good and it's easy as to use,
Could have a few more features and a complete kids Facebook for ages 10yrs old to however old it is till you can have a real Facebook page..,
Horrible. The app has suddenly been really glitchy and the microphone has stopped working,
This app is amazing and my children love it the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because my kids say it is lagging but beside that it is so good and I recommend it so good,
Really good for kids! Plus its not just a place to call and text your frieds you can also ply games too!,
I keep on pressing create account it is saying Something went wrong try again and I keep on trying again and it is doing the same thing.,
"I would give 5 stars but me and a friend were spamming eachother and now we cant chat unless its in a group chat but not just him its also all my new contacts it says ""message not sent"" and now i can only call his is fine now but mines been like this for a few days it never happened when i spammed an older contact! Please fix this and dont temporarily ban messages please give warnings and like how long it will be gone for! Thanks for your time!",
"Whenever i try and call it stops responding also whenever i click it and go to youtube it is unuseable, otherwise the app is really cool",
"I love this app for my children it's easy for them use & safe with all the parental controls & they can only message, call or video chat who I approve.",
"I can never describe how much I hate this app, it keeps logging me out, and then saying it is having trouble.",
Luv it my daughter is always on this app and I just love it that she keep on calling her friends and texting that just makes me happy so 5 stars.,
This Game is the best if I should of did not have this game I could not see my friends for ages I have all my friends and dad and mom and grandma in it and it has fun games and me and my friend we always play the games while we call one of my friends are always online and this game is the best,
"Me and my friends can talk but the call cuality is not so good. but,I still like the app. if the call cuality was better I wood Rate it a five.",
"I love it I think it's great for me your kids so you could always check on your kids.It is so amazing,awesome.",
This app is a good app you should get it for your kid but like mine she is a Samsung owner and I figured out apple users can go on gallery to find a picture they want while other cant I dont agreed with this but I really recommend,
Very nice but I wish you could add a thing that can let you create your own monster or more badges maybe but I love when I can talk to friends and chat by Alaya the 8 year old :),
Kids messenger is a social app and it's very fun you can talk to friends you can FaceTime and it's very fun it's for kids my parents are the people on to their kids account!!!!,
Terrible games and filters for kids. My 4 year old wanted to video chat with her grandmother and play game/use filters like she does on the regular messenger app. But the games were scary and so were the filters! Why? Who the heck chose these for children? Are you dense?!,
there are no adds and you can message and call so you should get this app it is the best messageing app ever in the WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!,
I just really love it it is amazing it lets us kids communicate and it is free you just have to ask a parent to help you sign up .,
It's a very good app but I wanna say like The Pleace Planet the App game inside the messenger kid was horrible There's like Weird emojis in there and like lesbian emojis like some weird things that I think children's don't need to learn about Lisbon stuff like just like day stuff and they're the stickers,
its a great app to use for little kids try it now! its recommend! i mean i recommend it... now i tell u go now its fun yo use yay my kid said when she used it its good way to start a reall one.,
The crazy dance game is rigged when you touch the ring when it flashes just like it says it doesnt work it just fails Please fix this,
Love it great app. And it is also a a great way for kids to contact each other.,
"The only problem is that with a you know 14-15 yr old this can prevent you from talking about stuff parents don't want to know, I would add a feature to were if you can prove your above 14, you can decide who is visible and non-visible. It's just an idea that I would add..",
i love it. but like someone times on calls people freeeze. but other then that it is amazing !!!!!!!,
I can talk to my friends but when the app fell asleep it also turns off a video chat But it is a great app.,
"Great app but I want to be able to send GIFS from my own device through the app rather that the app itself, it's quite annoying",
i LOVE this apptheres games i can change my text bubble color and i can chat with family and friends this deserves 5 stars you should also download this!!!!,
This is probably the best calling and video calling app I ever seen it does have some problems sometimes but I'm still giving it a 5 star rating,
My child loves the app but she has trouble getting into it it keeps logging her out I need you to fix that please I can't even log in cuz she doesn't know my Facebook password,
awesome i have this on my kids phone and on almost every electronic in this house. great app!!! i am telling you that you should totally get this app!!! please???,
This app is really helpful because I can chat with my younger friends and family who dont have regular messages or have iPads.,
I can't even log in because it has to be hooked up to the parent's Facebook like what if they don't have it? Also it's dumb the parent controls the account.,
This app is cool but it doesn't seem to work when you change your profile picture üôÑ...it is gust Like messenger but bitter and it's 4 kidsüòÅüòá,
ü§ç This for my kiddos. I approve everything and get detailed reports on whom they speak with and how long and any photos. It's spot on for what we were looking for.,
Love it. fun way to keep intouch! Simple with great funny filters. This is very cool. üòÅ,
Sometimes if your playing a game on a call it will break up. Other then that its amazing!,
This is a great app and lots of fun it's great reconnecting with freinds and family but I do wish I could share vidoes with peopleüòä,
"update broke app, logged out my child and none of the various ways of logging back in work, it just loops back to the login",
"Cannot get app to work. Sad, my daughter really wants to stay connected with her friends.",
I like it. it lets you communicate with other people but kind of glitchy time to time,
It's a good app where I can see what my child is typing and doing but the updates for Samsung to incredibly long to work like they do for apple,
This is a perfect app to chat with you friends the thing I love most is that you can video chat if you video chat in quarantine it's perfect,
Great app for kids to keep connected and I receive all messages on my phone to keep track of what their doing.,
This app sucks!! Sleep mode will turn on and i have to turn it off almost all the time!!,
This app is dumb because I locked out and in 100 times and it doesn't work And I want to call my friend and have fun and now I'm bored because I'm looking for a new app because this app is supid And all the time It says something went wrong and nothing Went wrongüí¢üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,
"Simple is, Simple Does..... Really good for the kids to to there family and all the kids there age #DOPES""""""""""""""""T STAY Awesome & Blessed...... It's Bam @bam07_",
A good and working Apps. I'm able to connect with my kids without a Telco sim card only wifi/internet connection.,
This is a great app. I love how they put in more filters every month.I would like more updates.,
app is not working. anyone we call they can't answer and when they call us it doesn't ring just notifies of a missed call,
There are much better kids messaging apps available. You can't even send gifs to your own child.,
its a very good app but i really want to select a picture from your gallery and make the app look different please? from-amelia ^-^,
I have updated my rating as you have fixed the previous issue! Won't let me sign my kid in on his new phone! Just keeps going back to enter my user name and password,
The app won't let me make a new account. I've tried for 2 days and it still doesn't work. please fix this devs.,
"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Amasing app, couldn't have been better, I don't think I'll ever delete this app. SO GREAT!!",
This is a very good app and it's very good for talking with my friends and facetiming them so yeah this app is worth it get us it have fun with your friends and even family,
Love the concept but there appears to be no way to export any of the pictures or videos contained in the app.,
Good but alot slow and when you get all your missions it doesn't give you more.but overall I think it's a good app.,
Keeps logging my kid out. Asks for an adult to reenter password and grant permission than fails and loops me back around again. So frustrating.,
Love the app there are no adds it's a easy way to talk with friends silly games and filters totally recommend this app.,
Having the most issues with trying to add friends to one of my kids accounts. It keeps saying error for months now,
I like how I know so much and have to approve her friends. I also enjoy how I can peek at conversations. Makes me feel better.,
Cant create account for my child. Just repetedly says account creation failure. Uninstalled reinstalled. Same thing try again an no luck,
I love this app I want to give it a 100 stars but sadly I can't I love it but they could have more colors but uther then that it is an amazing app 5 stars,
I hate this app because i just wanted to call my friend but i can't even to that becuase of my last app text and talk that app is terrible i can't even hear anyone i call and they can't hear me.,
Messenger is a really good fun app but it doesn't load very well and there is always bad connection but not on any other apps I go on.,
Cannot log in. Rest password and got a code too. Cannot log in. Cannot log into my account. Therefore this app is useless. Cannot use.,
I love this app it helps me talk to my kids that I don't see a lot I love it but my kids call and then hang upüò°üò°,
This is a fun app to be able to text my friends and different games and missons to do and you can facetime your friends and family during covid 19,
I'm having the same issue it won't let me log in and keeps making a constant loop back to the authorize screen,
"I'm on a amazon tablet, so it doesn't work. But, i downloaded it on my ipad and it's pretty good.",
It's great overall but the one thing I want to have changed is that your account should not be deleted if you uninstall the app,
The ap need to be a little more easier to use like Regular messenger with more backgrounds When you are face time your friends just like regular messenger,
It`s so cool and exciting to have New thangs and I just loved it cents I can't talk to my cousin! So I think it's good for me and other kids!,
Whenever I tap create account it doesn't work and just says something went wrong when we were creating your child's account. I tried for 2 days.,
"I did log my daughter out and tried to log back on it, and it won't let me log back on.",
"Every message comes with a block & i have to repeatedly ""download on andro"" almost every time to see it.",
this application is very useful for kids.but it needs to be upgraded. i love it. is very helpful. keep going,
I love the app because you can talk to your friends and family but the only thing I do not like about this app is that if you are off of it. For a long time it logs you out of your account,
it's a really good app I can call my mom and also random numbers can't call you just the people in you contacts good app keep up the good work,
"On multiple devices it will not let me log in to authorize the parent account, just keeps asking over and over.",
I like this app I can message friends and family but one thing I want like cute filters like the ones on snap chat but other then that this is a five star rating for this app,
I love that my daughter has her own account and I can fully manage and monitor it. I also absolutely love that she can call me and I can call her whenever she is not home.,
I love this because it I can talk to my friends and I can use filters on does not like the regular messaging you can talk to grown-ups the granite messenger but the kids messenger is baby cuz it's you can really of irritated and you can talk to your friends so I am really really really happy all that I have this,
Will update when I can use it. Can't add family keeps saying error try again later. Trying to add my son's grandpa and cousin both adults and it won't let me add them üòï any way of fixing it?,
Horrible. Cant even pick a picture from my gallery for my profile picture. Its only for IPhones. You guys are stupid for making it just for IPhones. Why is everything for Iphones these days. If you guys used your brain you would know that people cant afford IPhones. You guys are rude. I wish you could give it 0 stars.,
App is awesome for kids it's just you can talk to anybody or I don't hear that awesome the best app I ever ever got so this is.,
So adorable and so convenient. Safe and easy for my babies to access and use. Great idea!,
Messenger kids is a pretty good app but the filters assume genders and personality and the filters are VERY glitchy but I do not hate it.,
I love this app but when you get on a game it hast to hang up the call and my friends can't come here so can you fix it peleas.,
Very good it tells me when u get a call and i also like there is games on it including pets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :),
"Remove the ""POP"" that you can't mute or atleast make it so the parent can disable it no parent that I know likes it and no kid does either its WAY too loud and over rides silent mode even with Dev options on PLEASE remove It...",
I love it so so so much it because it let me and my bffS and my sister call each other kids should download the app I gave it a 5 star because I love it but sometimes don't use it but it's a great app,
Really good app best too use and to call people and you can play with filters and emotes too. God bless all the people who read this thanks.,
I keep getting notifications that my daughter sent me something but that's all I receive. Obviously this is to high tech for me. Lol,
hi there i love this app becouse you can see people who are far away an in defrent countrys an talk to people. i think its really clever an amazing thanks for making it . !!!!!!!!!!,
"Whenever I try to sign my kid up for this app, it keeps saying account creation failure, so the app is completely unsusble",
It is good working you can text send stickers videos and pictures it is a great app for kids,
"It wouldn't let me sign in because of this DuMb Facebook thing WHEN I'M 8 AND OF COURSE I HAVE NO FACEBOOK plus my family doesn't have Facebook either, plz change the Facebook thingy to something else for I can see my homies",
I can't verify device. I put in my password. Bit it's in a loop. I've tried on different devices.,
Its a great app but i can never see my friends when i call them their screen never works when they are sitting there or sometimes mine dosent work,
I downloaded this app and it said that it's not available in my region :( I uninstalled it and tried installing it again and had the same result.,
It has only video call option I hope developer will add audio call option too. Great move. Love this feature ‚ù§,
Won't let me sign in on multiple devices keeps puti me in a loop of putting in my email and password. Very frustrating,
This app helped me so much and I had so much fun with it it was way easier to use for me I could talk to all my friends wuth this app.,
Needs to be a little bit more easier on the password because it's saying that you can only use a 6 long password in the password that they give you is too long for your password,
"Very good but one problem, I cant make my profile picture a picture i have saved on my device. Besides that it is very good.",
I downloaded the app two days ago so I could talk to my grandkids and so far it keeps saying there's a problem and it can't be set up. I'm very disappointed.,
its a good app for kids and they get to talk with there friends and its free and they get to send funny drawings and they get to play games with there friends so i give it a 5 star.,
This app is pretty good but I can't play games it wint alow the exspor butten to come on it it wont let me chose a coler other wise I wold rate this a 5 star.I dont know if it is my phone or the app.,
This app kicked my daughter off while she was talking to her grandparents now it's an endless loop of authorizing my account... She had Bern using this app for 2 year and never had an issue until now,
"this is the best app ever im able to call and text my friends and its just like messenger, the app grown ups use, this app is family friendly for little kids to use and I love it",
"My child cannot recieve calls on Messenger. When I or others call, it does not ring- even when he has messenger pulled up. After I hang up, he gets a notice that he missed my call. What is wrong here?",
Everytime I try to to log in it keeps saying some thing went wrong every time I tried different phones but it kept saying that I am tired of this app,
Keeps kids safe very appropriate for kids I think this is a very good app for texting it's very fun 2 there is a lot of games to play to,
"So, I'm a parent. My kids are on this app with their other parent, but there's no way to use this app to talk with them unless I make a kid account for myself? Not a great job!",
5 stars well deserved. love this app. able to message my daughter. send messages. love how I can text her.,
Its so fun i can text and call so many peaple but it would be so much better if you did not have to do video call and you could do regular calls to,
Android here and after your update I can't seem to log back in just keeps taking me in a vicious cycle of putting my password over and over will no login,
It's so fun and child friendly you can text and talk to your friends and even call each other. üòÅ,
It's a lovely app but all I want to say is could you added an update allowing the users to log in their accounts instead of making another one,
I can talk to my friends and play games. I can FaceTime my friends and I can share games that I play on there. I can't send bitmojis or A.R Emoji Stickers that I customized.,
This is awesome both of my kids use it and because of covid it is a great way for them to communicate with friends,
It is fun you get to talk to your friend or friends but when I try to do the song thing and put a gift it just has my face frozen and moving every 5 seconds,
This app is really good but sometimes it takes REALLY long to load and when you wanna play with your pet or a game it will take even LONGER TO LOAD,
Says I'm not allowed to use this app but does not explain why or how to rectify the situation. Also no reply from FB after emailing them.,
"I like it, I can chat with all my friend and build bridges to other ones just with silly codes and fun games.",
This app is amazing but i wish there was screen share! Screen share would be amazing! (^v^) But thats it! No other stuff that blothers me! Overall this app is 5 starz ÿ™,
"Downloaded for my son to keep in touch with his grandparents, but it won't let me confirm his account and then Facebook emails me that someone is trying to sign into my account on another device. Can't figure out why it's not working?",
You can interact with others - that's hard in the covid 19.You can also see friends that might be hard to hang out or to chat to.,
"This is the best app ever. I can talk to my friends and my brothers and mom and dad all the time, and also my aunts and uncles, and messenger you need like their phone number and everything, and you can forget your phone number, and you getting your phone, and they don't even remember you well not remember you like they might not believe you, when you say there you like you know what I mean so for me this is better than messenger BECAUSE you be friends with them forever even wen have new üì±",
I love this app because it is a experience for kids my age to practice their typing and it also makes it fun.,
great app for kids!!!! no ads popping up and she gets to stay connected with family! love it!,
THIS APP IS SO AMAZING like after all this time I use to not download this app but I searched it now I created like 56 accounts to call with and video chat with computer and phone close together,
Great kids app. Very secure. You choose who your kids can contact and you get an update on what media they send and how many messages and calls were sent,
"Let me delete accidental messages, Otherwise my phone is a oven everytime I video chat. It gets the job done though so pretty good",
"Well,It is safe,but I can't send pictures without it not letting me send anymore messages.",
This us the best you can have a call with your friends and you can play games to. This app is really cool. You should install it.,
I love this app it is so good for my kid and she loves it too mainly cause she can talk to her friends while she is stuck at home,
Great but I need updates to come quicker and for it to ACTUALLY update and have the same updates as other devices coz my friends could change chat colour but I couldn't please FIX this thank you,
Worked perfect until today. Cant recieve voice messages or connect to video calls. Says internet needed even tho we are connected. Please help.,
"its cool but i dont like the fact you cant call without video, or save videos that your friends send you.",
I like it but I would like to make a suggestion to this: in calls do a share screen when out of the app.,
I have tried signing in mutiple times but it keeps saying to check my internet and I have over several times.,
Safe. Like the fact that its controlled by parents rather the kids. I know my child's activities and friends she adds. Awesome app. Thx fb,
I haven't been able to open this app all week! just goes to a blank screen and closes,
I absolutely love this app it great but it needs more colours and you could even make pattern thing and stuff like that,
I think this app is perfect for children to communicate with friends an family and they have to put in a code and the parents have to approve it so it is impossible for them to end up talking with someone who might be dangerous.,
can't seem to always get ahold of my profile and switch around my friends also to restart the app so I can start all over again and my friends go missing all the time,
It is good but it can be better if it can be on landscape mode especially for tablets.,
"This is a great app! I'm just weirded out by this there's no voice call, can u guys add voice call?",
Good for my daughter to use. I enjoy being able to approove who she can communicate with and that i can reveiw her messages,
It's good. But the internet can randomly stop working on the app even though the internet is working well,
No way to delete kids messages and the notifications are overwhelming. The kids love it.,
I love this app I have all ma friends you can also add other people and there's nice filters and things and I'm editing this in 2021 I wrote it 2 on mabey 1 year ago,
I love this app but when you log out you have to put parents phone number and facebook passwod on it and it hangs you up when you are talking and playing a game but other than that i love it,
Will not authorize ANY device when trying to log in. Used to work great until a week ago. Now you cannot use this app at all.,
It won't even let me create an account for my daughter.,
It is a really cool message app for little kids to yext their parents or grand parent if they want. You have to log in with your Facebook account.,
Love the app just wish there was a delete text opiton and being able to send links... pls add this aND I'll change to 5 star,
when i try to facetime the screen freezes then a few seconds later it says messenger kids isen't resoponding and i can't acecept calls other wise the app is grate,
this app is amazing no adds you can talk to your friends. i think it is very nice.,
There is no easy way to control when messenger can be used. My daughter can't use this app if her messenger is always on lock down. Pointless!,
My 7 year old sister loves this app she can talk to her classmet and our mom and dad plus it has a lot of filters and games but she hates when it lags a bit,
Can we get screen share,
"Great app but I have one problem. When I make my account it comes up with ""Something went wrong"". Please fix this üôè",
I love this app i can video chat with all my friends and text with them. I littarly have this on all my devices.,
I love it because you can talk to your cousins or friends and you have a pet also you can draw and funny pictures. You need to get it!!üëç,
"i have really enjoyed this app for my kid but, i wish you could see the messages they are sending.",
This app it's great I can text my daughter while I'm at work and she can be in touch with her friends!,
My son loves using all the different filters when he calls us on messenger. It helps when he visits his dad or he can call his dad whenever he can.,
"Can't moderate messages?!? How can you miss such an important feature. Lame, just like this app.",
This app sucks. Literally every time I went to log in in kicked me out over and over again it is really anyone so I do not recommend this app .,
"I love this app it's a way to communicate with my friends without worrying about stalkers, scammers, etc.",
This is an amazing app!!! I love using the filters and everything me and my friends call each other so much!,
the only thing I wish I could do it set it so during the day she can only call me at work. she will blow her mawmaw up 10 times in a row and she works somewhere in customer service so she really cant be having her phone going off like that! shes 3 so I get it but I still like to be able to call her directly on her tablet especially when my teenage niece is baby sitting her without her being able to call everyone else. (she also called my aunt while she was vacationing in Europe.),
great app! sometime can you make it so we can change ringtones for when some one texts or when they call?,
"This app is kid friendly (as said in the name) but, the games don't work as well any more or the filters. .",
I give this game a four star because like when you started you have to you have to like do something you have to pay like my dad doesn't like to pay because he like has like $1 left so can you please make it so it's free to go in,
I love Messenger kids but when your talking to your friends/family its always on portrait side so if you can you make it landscape as well then there will be no problem,
It is awesome but the reason I gave it four stars is because it has to take alot of space and it takes a long time to install,
"I can talk to my friends that still don't have a phone using this. It's a bit laggy sometimes, but it works",
Been having the same issue. When will this be fixed? I've been trying to log in for weeks and the app is still not working.,
this is great for my kiddos! they can chat with their friends and family safely! recommend to other parents.,
My son uses this app to keep in contact with family and friends and we both love it. It's a great way for them to communicate and for you to monitor for peace of mind.,
this app is so good to my kid and she loves it but it is glictey and has bad camra coulity my kid can talk to her friends but they get over it in a cople of houers so im deleting it,
"Really good app to track your younger kids, who they talk with and they can also call you and stay in touch with the family.",
it's funny cuz I can talk to my friends my mom to my dad and a bunch of other people that's about it and I love the cool filters it's pretty fun I really like to make sure try and download it make sure that your parents approve of it,
This app sucks my daughter can't find her family on this app and I have them on my Facebook and I can't find them and she can't take pictures at all so I would not get this app it's a scam,
"Amazing this is a great way to talk to Family,Friends and etc .Kids Messager also has games which is amazing",
It's a good app for young kids to communicate with friends and family of your choice.It is also kid freindly app.,
Stupid update not letting me log in and getting stuck on Authorising. People have been having problems and no fixes to be seen,
"My kids and I love this messenger app. It's a great way for them to keep in touch with their friends while not able to be in school, and family members that live far away.",
"the app will not load on my Android tablet, I have tried every trouble shooting fix with no success.",
Only real complaint i have is that to add other kids to my sons account i have to add their parents to my account or to add an adult they have to be added to my friends list first . I and his mother are divorced so there is a challenge. And if i block anyone on my account it also blocks them on his account . I like the fact that he cant add anyone and that i have control of it but i shouldn't have to add them to my account to doit . Its a real pain . Oh and plus i cant send him any youtube vide,
i just downloaded it for my kid thats 10 and she loves it so much shes always with her phone and texting me and her bffs its the best for kids.ps try it parents.,
This has been helpful to message my child and keep track of who is talking to. I like being able to limit his access now while he is young.,
This app is great for my daughter and she loves it. She loves to talk to her friends and family. So I think parents should download this app for their kids,
Having alot of problems getting this app to even open. Very upsetting for my little girl.,
It was a great messaging app for kids but when you vidio chat it always freezes or is late and the timings wrong!,
"I give it a 2 star, because it's neat. But I hate how they show lesbian and gay things. Like in stickers. And emojis. Kids are too young to know about that junk.",
I used to have it but then I don't have it now because I don't think I can install it anymore. yeah but I still like it thank you. üòä and anyway there was no ads.,
It's a fun texting app but I wish they have a up date so we can add pics as our profile but other than that it's wonderful üòä‚ù§Ô∏è,
"I use this everyday to text my friends and family, send then funny photos and play games! It really is awesome",
it's great but I was reloading new codes because my son wasn't liking the ones he was getting and it took away the codes all together and wont reload,
It is so slow it glitches all the time I tried to send a pick of a modest cute swimsuit to my freind and it wouldn't let me send it!,
My daughter has been using this app for 2 years and it just stopped working. Very disappointing!,
This app kept me with friends and cousins because when u down get the app it makkes a code to add people u need your code so when u get a friend u can call text and even send photos,
I love this app for my kiddo. I just wish I could see her messages from my phone instead of having to check hers.,
"This messenger kids has to go, my daughter really wants it and she can't get it just because I put in my Facebook password, but it doesn't work.",
I thinks this is a fantastic app... However parents oughta be able to send things from the web and photos to their own children,
"I have no idea what to rate it sincr i havent even used it yet but when i put my facebook password, It says im not allowed onto this app, Can you fix this? pls!!!!!!",
the app opens and then closes. tried to redownload and srill having the same issues. PLEASE FIX,
My experience is great especially since this corna thing is going around I can communicate and stay safe thanks for making this app stay safe and stay healthy,
it wonl`t let you down load it bc of corona and you have to use your facebook password and acount!?!?!??the only good thing about it is... you can text your friends and do challenges and you can draw and send it to anyone you want maybe your friend or your sibling or mom but... there are things you have to draw like a shark. you can do filters on call and filters in a pic! but you have to set something up :( and there are rules like don`t call or text a millon times and you can report and block.,
It's really easy for my child to stay in touch with her friends outside of school and especially during this pandemic,
This is a great app. My friends are far away so now i can text them when ever i want.,
"This is pretty cool. My daughter can talk to only her friends or relatives that I approve. It's safe, and she gets to start learning social media in a way that I can monitor it.",
It great for my son he can play and talk with all his friends he can talk to me when he need to you should try it,
"I have great difficulty accessing messages from my granddaughter. In fact, I have only seen one message!!! Something's wrong!!! I am not computer saavy; but, you must simplfy for 72 year old grandmothers!!! Thk U & God bless you!!!",
I deactivated facebook but my facebook messenger is working normal. Now I cannot view the messenger for kids app info.. they shouldn't be linked..,
I luv the app but it would be cool if we could change the video call so it could be like normal phone call,
I'm giving it 4 stars cuz whenever I press my profile it just turns to a black screen and it puts me to the getting started screen like I got a friend request and I can't open it wow,
"Easy to navigate & great way to keep in touch with your young people, to keep them safe.",
"Overall great, im just wondering if 2 people are able to manage an account? I co-parent and we want her to just have the one account that we can both have control of.",
This App Is Really Cool The Only Thing Is When Someone Texts You Twice It Only Pops Up Once So You Never Know Is If Someone Text You Twice. OtherWise Its A Very Good App,
It's a great way to chat with your friends and family but it doesn't let me do enjoy the doing funny faces!! I hope that it will let you do funny faces üòâüòâüòâüòäüòäüòäüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÜ,
I like it but it needs work. Even though I downloaded the app I keep getting messages and video chats from my daughter's contacts that I've approved. Is that supposed to happen?,
"K so the games on this app never load, so u can't play them. It allows chain msgs and it scared my friend >:(",
this app was fun then i wont let me update so now it always say that my messenger is asleep.as soon as i log in i need to log out.and my mum says that she turned off the messenger thingy and IT DOES NOT WORK please fix it.i mean it is good still BUT i have to do that EVERY day unless its school day please fix it for us.,
I tried getting this on my PC and it states that it would be installed soon but it never actually showed up on my START page.,
I created an account loaded contacts but it Will Not Load. The contacts have accepted but now what?? It sits and spins but never loads.,
This app is really helpful for me.. This app let's us talk with our friends and family.. really appreciate it!,
I tried to create an account but it always fails. My childrrn aren't happy with me because of this. I want this fixed.,
It was working well at first Now for a week we can't log in and when tried another device we are in a loop of authorize device So disappointed and the kids too for losing contact with their friends and family And in 2023 and updating the review again the kids can't access and always in the loop of signing I.,
"It won't accept my fb password and when I do the ""change my password"" it says I can't do that at this time! I am very displeased!",
Think this is awesome and a safe way for our kids to chat to friends without period gaining access your kid can add there friends but only the parent can accept it so there is no way for it to be unsafe,
Was good for a while. Now every time i answer or make a call it immediately drops. Ive seen no way to remedy this issue.,
"Thank you, for creating this, it helped me talk my feelings out, no other app has done that. Thank you soooooooo much, if I could I would rate it 1000 stars but... for now it's going to be, a five. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!! üòÜüòÜüòÜ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° (,‚òÜ‚ô°‚òÜ,)",
"Same issue as everyone else, can no longer get past the verification page as it keeps looping...",
Whenever I type something like :) or :D or :o it autocorrects to an emoji like üòÄ or üòØ. Please fix this immediately.,
I wanted to get this to text my freinds cause one of them doesn't have a phone but I can't get it cause u have to sign in with Facebook which is dumb fix it,
Really good for kid to communicate with there friends and family,
It lags out sometimes and is alot more space than the actual messenger app. But other than that this app is great!,
"It will not let me make an account for my child, we had one before and it worked fine. I made a new account and deleted the old one and now it keeps saying account failure try again later.",
Great I get to play online games with friends and chat at the same time my favorite feature is the video chat download now it will be worth it,
Doesnt let me create his account. Keeps giving me an error message. I've tried creating his account on 3 different devices now. WTH,
"I just dont know why, we can't change our profile pic once we select it, but overall its a good app.",
Its really good for kids and my daughter can finally text me and her friends with out getting bullied or getting her feelings hurt.=),
Can't even create My daughter an account! gives me an error all the time.,
To show the kids how many times they have called someone it could be a good idea to put the video call button only in the chat. So they have to go into the chat first before calling.,
This app is good! I am in middle school and i can talk to my cousins and aunts and uncles without having any problems with it ^^,
I can't accept or delete my aunts request to chat with my son. Logging in was hard because it said my password was wrong on my Facebook and it wasn't. I used to never have issues.,
When I Log In It Doesn't Let Me In Very Disappointed at this but the rest is great kids can communicate and video calls a bit glitchy I Vote This 4 Star üåü Thanks For Listening to my opinion,
Messenger Kids is the best. Its still messenger but for kids. Their is fun stuff in Messenger Kids. For example there is games on it. Hope you enjoy it!,
"Having problems login, it takes me back to password and then again asking for email. Very Frustrating!!!",
"This App version doesn't work, can't authorise and log in",
You guys need to add more songs buy copycat from Billie eilish or like Dark Horse from Katy Perry but overall I do love the app but please add more songs,
This is really good to keep in contact with school friends and friends that have moved away. Is there some way to delete a photo your child has taken and sent to everyone?,
"I love this cause my mom doesn't let me do regular messages but it is great, fun games and video chats. It is fun.",
"A friend wants me to add her on this app, and i have created a Facebook account to add her. i have confirmed that i am at least 13 years old, but when i enter my phone number and password, it tells me ""user is not allowed to log in"". It's confusing me, as i have clearly said i am OVER 13. I wonder why? Please give a solution.",
"Its cool, but you should be able to do more than 3 drawings every some hours.",
So easy to call out Baby now instead of trying to reach her through either parents phones. Thank you for MK..,
I just wish I could view her messages from my phone. I like that she cant delete messages but I wish I could review or delete from my end of the app.,
"Its a reallgy good app, and I can connect with lots of friends! I love it! -WKG",
"When I was creating an account It said ""an error occured"" so I deleted it and reinstalled it a few times and it still did that",
I really like this app couse I am downloading it right now on my tablet aka the thing I'm typing it's perfect for me because it's my still little so I don't have a phone so I do it on my mom's phone it's just a really good app I recommend it,

It wont let me sign up for it says failure to create account. Already uninstalled it and installed and still wont work,
Fun to send friends/family funny pictures. This app also helps ur children to communicate with other people.,
This is great for kids parents can monitor what the children are doing and they have to text you if they want you to add any more friends so again great for kids and parents üëç üòÄ,
"It is so fun you can text and call your friends ,and help grow you pet so download it now you won't regret it and thats coming from an 8 year old kid.",
Really good for kids. So many options to do for them. Like being able to read their text messages.,
It keeps logging me out every time I log back in I deleted it and downloaded it and it did the same thing please fix this issue,
I love this app!!! it's easy and fun for me to text my family and friends! (MY friends are my family),
Love this app!! I am so happy I can monitor my daughter's activity and her contacts this makes me feel good to know I can control what she's exposed to!,
So bad it always glitches and i cant type or send messages it is the biggest waste of space when it doesnt even work,
This is awesome for kids! My 5yo can literally facetime her friends when she wants and I have full control of who she is calling and who's calling her! Times are evolving people.,
camera won't work on her tablet. when I try to turn it on then the camera stops working too,
I love the app it's really fun it's really cool I can contact my friend my family and it lets me log back in and it's so good no errors no nothing I give it a 5-star rating,
Fun because I can talk to my friends whenever I want and when we Call I can do filters and play games and text it's the best please try it out.,
It is a fun way to talk to my friends in a safe way! It has fun games and all! I love messenger kids ‚ù§Ô∏è,
While trying to upload a replacement profile picture onto the child account it keeps giving an error about no connection available even though the rest of the app seems to be working...,
"Won't allow me to add contact. Allows me to see the person, send requests then errors",
This is wonderful for the kids. They stay in contact but not close in proximity Thanks to COVID19,
I loved that music one the filter can you please bring it back and keep it there please I love your app it's awesome,
"No longer working. wont allow my parents to sign in on any device, amazon, chromebook. cleared cache and still nothing",
Its awsome but if we could have ringtones it would be 10's across the board I mean it's a suggestion!!!,
"Did not go pass the photo for profile part. It said ""no internet"". We had/have internet. After several attempts, decided to uninstall.",
I love it I can talk to my friends and family and its lots of fun and my family loves it to I can call and text them when ever I want.,
It is so cool if your friend has an iPhone 11 and you have an Android then this will work so Good for FaceTime,
It's a great app you can text your friends and family's and any other people you call and text,
Can't get it to open have to go through Facebook and for some reason it says wrong password!!,
The app is very good but after like 1 minute it tends to end call. Please fix this. Thank you.,
I didn't even get into the app because it was asking for a Facebook account. Like seriously? You think kids have a Facebook accounts. Way to complicated.,
"So when i first started to log in, it said i need to put in my facebook account, BUT i didnt have a facebook account, so now i cant use this app. üôÅ",
"This App needs better filters and it's slow, also it needs an upgrade and also add nicknames please.üòâüòâ",
It is a cool app but my friends can add music to their vids but i cant i have updated the app but it did nothing,
Was never able to use app becuae I couldn't authorize it as it continued to say account not found every time I entered my email and ph number,
I love it but I cannot use my Bluetooth headphones and at the moment I can't change the colors so just be aware of that it's a really nice,
It's great the only done fall is that I have to be friends with the person add the person to her kids messenger.,
I love talking with my friends during COVID-19ü¶†üò∑. But I can't text my friend sometimes we can only video chat.,
trying to log in and it keeps looping me back to login again! super annoying and my daughter is really upset!,
I love this app and I can chat with all my friends well not ALL and my neighbours.I love how you can have group chats but why can you not play games?You can make a multi people games!Also on group chats MAX is 4 I don't like that.It's just stupid because what if you have more friends and you all want to have a group?That's only the little problems. Why can you not just normal call on messenger kids You can only video chat. Messenger you can callI I can use Messengr to chat with other but I can't,
"My children love using this app. However, we wish there was a format that we could use on our home computer.",
it works pretty well but it would be nice if you could turn off your camara but still be able to talk at will.,
"Randomly stops working. ""Unable to send"" message various times in three last month.",
it takes a long time to update and load but you can stay in toych with your friends online too.,
"Its super easy to use, can check on your kids conversations, and allow and block whoever you need to!",
I give it a 5 star because I can text my friends and facetime them I downloded the app a few days ago and its amazing.,
This app is so good. You can see what your child is doing and they can't get friend unless they go through you first.,
Stuck on the authentication. Keeps cycling through. Cleared cache. Uninstaller reinstalled. Not working,
Love the app but for some reason when sleep mode turns off it still won't let me text or call for like another hour pls fix this.,
Very good app can text my friends and it immediately sends but there's a glitch where I dont get a notification.,
Stopped working on Chromebook since the last update.  Please make it available for OS74 again PLEASE,
So awesome. My kids stay in touch with all their family and friends. Plus I can make sure I know what they are talking about. Best thing out for protecting my kids.,
It is good but can you try and add snapchat filters mostly the new anime filter please it would be alot more fun but it is great,
The latest update logged my daughter out and we can't log her back in. Logging in just results in the login screen reloading.,
For some reason when I'm on the call with my friends it hangs up and I'm not clicking hang up button and I also caint hear the call sound please help üò≠,
It's is good to be able to keep in touch with my family and friends. It has some fun game that you can send back and forth. Over all I really like this app.,
"Give the kids time to learn how to text, hopefully help with their confidence in the long run!!!",

I love this app and I can call all my friends and family frum far places this is the best app for kids to call on,
"It's perfect, but on the tablet it keeps failing to change my kids color. why is that?",
Cuz I can text people and call people and FaceTime and my friend I always call her she is the best she lets me call me.,
It's very like entertaining well not exactly you do I love you can do calls and text messages and I love it,
I can't even access my children's accounts anymore. Not exactly parent controlled if the parent can't access it.,
I like it but I can't see all the videos my friends send to me and they take a long time to load,
It worked very well but when on a call the other person was blurry.,
My son and I text and video chat and send pictures. It works perfectly!!,
Because whenI go in a call or try to send a photo the app says sprry camera can not be opend right now please help fixs it,
I love using messager kids but one thing that really really needs to get fixed is the glitches,
The messaging is good but FaceTime the screen can black out sometimes altho its still good,
I love this but it won't let me log in so Im mad it keeps saying account failure It makes me so mad but otherwise it great I had it before,

It suck i cant even log in i keep saying I did something wrong when I did nothing I checked over this like five times already and I did nothing wrong this app sucks and it's not my phone,
I experienced that it's safer for kids. It also is entertaining because of the games it has.,
it needs to be for pc's comepters and other stuff i might rate it again if i can,
I liked Messenger Kids but it glitched alot and sometimes it just hanged up on my friends or me when we were just talking so thats why I dont love love Messenger Kids.,
Message Kids is an awesome app for kids it's kid friendly and the parents have to approve of the people that your kiddos want to add,
I love it but there is one bug where it glitches and hangs up my friends conversations with me,
I love this app is great for my kids and ican sign in to there account's and see what there texting too,
"It requires a Facebook account to be able to use it, overall just annoying",
See whenever you text someone most of the time it won't go through which can really suck,
"Unable to authorize my daughter's new phone. Error ""the user is not allowed to log into to app""",
Great for the kids to stay connected over the holidays without phones. Plus I can say hi when I'm at work.,
The app is not asleep but it said when i try to text someone it doesn't work.,
It is great except just 1 thing my friend Diego gets a voice changer and I don't but we are on the same device,
It's fun to talk to Friends and family but for me it's slow getting messages I got the message before I got the message for the message,
Its a very lacking app and glich is so very hard so i demand to fix the glich and bugs so i can give one star,
It's a good app but I cant mess around with the tappingdilters it just doesn't work,
I can text my sister on it. It is so fun you can send emojis and pictures and videos and call,
This app has helped me because it helps me to chat and make calls with my friends and family . I enjoy and love this app so I recommend messenger kids for you.,
I love this app it's so easy to use and I can talk to many friends at a time,
Can't send links to your child. Very frustrating.,

I get to the authorize device and it says enter authorization code. I DONT GET THE CODE. Kid can't use it if it won't let me LOG IN,
It would be good if I could make an account everything it always says it failed to make an account would rate 5 if problem was fixed.,
It is so good no ads I love it definitely deserve the 5-star rating!!!!!,
On Android it is not letting me click the games when I play them with my niece. This is very frustrating.,
This app absolutely sucks I do not at all recommend it because I had it going just fine and then I wanted to log into my account on my phone so it would be on my phone and my tablet but it would not let me log in on my phone so I did everything I could and I watched videos and tutorials and tried to do things and it still wouldn't let me log on on my phone and then now I couldn't log back in on my tablet and my only option was to delete my account and when I made a new one it won't let me log in,
it realy good but my friends cant use my code and everytime i get some one i cant fine there name so i have to deleate and downlode mesenger kids angain but other than that i think it is worth four stars,
Unable to log in to app no matter what. First time user and if bug not fixed asap will be last time user also,
"Everytime I go to type it stop and then I have to double tap it to let me type and when I go to hit the space bar it ,ages me call someone plz help im getting tired of this",
Great to be in contacts with my kids. I wish I can see all the conversations they have as I can see all the pictures and videos.,

"It's the best üòòüòôüòç, I can chat and text with my friends and family. It's awesome , and definitely recommend it to you üòÑüëçüëçüëç",
Worked but now it doesn't because of the new update. My phone is deactivated and now I can't message my family...,
"On Facebook its still asking to download the regular messenger to see the conversations, so whats the point of, this one.",
This app is amazing for kids. It's mostly for little kids but it's also good for older kids!,
Great app and simple enough for my three yr old to use. Just wish there was a lite version.,
I expected allot more options. Just really disappointed at how little they get to do with the app.,

This app is amazing i use it for calling my friends and family. The only thing is it takes up a lot of space on my phone.,
I should be able to see my child's actual chat logs from this app. This lack of functionality is a serious deficiency for this app.,
Like the controls and what hours they can use the app awesome i really like this. -GreatJob,
"When I try to log in all my other games I have deleted say like ""welcome back'' and stuff and when i try to log in its allways logs me back out. I leave this game a 1",
Love this app for children to be able to control who they talk to and kids still being able to have fun.,
My daughter loves this game called toca world and want to share houses or whatever but she can not share her screen I think this would be a fun thing for kides to have.,
very nice app i can talk to my friend and family on this app i do wish they would add more filters they took off all of the good ones.,
This is a great app for messaging friends and family. You can have lots of fun playing the games and using the filters.,

"Great app. I can see her msgs, both to and from. She can make video calls too.",

"I think it is great. Parents need to limit time as well as content. better,Parents limit your online. Love time avail",
"This app is good. I highly recommend kids playing this, and plus you can chat with your friends in quarantine",
My kids loved kids messenger and have used it for a couple years now but since yesterday they got logged out and when I try to authorize there devices it keeps going back to parent authorize it will not authorize none of the devices and I even tried 5 or 6 devices and even created a different account to try and still same thing want is going on my kids want to call there grandma and can't because kids messenger is not working,
"Doesnt work, keep getting an error. Have tried to contact for supoort but no response.",
I use it every day you should get this app you can call there is stickers games and you can text you should get it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
The app is good but I'm a kid that has a phone and I don't have a Facebook account so I can't login like that's ridiculous if you want to download this app make sure you have Facebook,
Because I really like this because well all the other video chat stuff to make you sign up and ask questions and it's a little confusing so messenger for kids is a great help,
I really.like this app. My friends have it and it was the last day of school so I can talk to th em more often,
Love the game but I keep on getting a black screen when I am playing with my friend,
Useless trash. Just give your kid Snap Chat or something else simple to message each other and send them outside to play.,
Nice for chatting and facetime with the grandchildren. Can not find out how to delete old or unwanted messages.,
Its great for kids and your kids are fully secure on it cant be looking up on facebook or on messanger only can be added by other kids who have the app and how have your kids code and must be accepted by you,
My kids can't use the Bluetooth headsets we bought for them while in calls. What a joke of an app.,
easy to use step by step directions self explanatory great layout positive reinforcement for children to learn five stars all the way,
Good and bad I wish there was more games and the games most of them use face and are to hard and boring wish you would have more pictures of nonsense,
Amazing app i love it! It is easy to use and my kids lo e it to talk to family and friends,
Needs more games to play with friends. More changes to existing games or levels,
Still no work,
Once I got the app it's amazing because you could communicate with your friends!!!,
I love this app! the parental controls is really use full and it helps kids be kids!,
"Can not log in, we have rebooted, updated and restarted all phones/devices still no luck.",
It will not let me put in my password for face book. Ugh I need it and it says unavailable ir wrong please fix this because I've been trying,
"I cant change my color anymore i used to be purple now im blue if there is a way to change my color with this new ""update"" please tell me i liked it better before this update :( i want it back. this is coming from a messanger kids user",
This app is always messing up. And if you live in different states from your kids. You can't fix it.,
I have been trying to talk to customer support but its non existent. I hope they will soon but I won't hold my breath. I've tried multiple avenues but no response. be very careful before you login.,
It's horrible I can't even make a account I've tried so many times I uninstalled it 3 times now and it still won't work,
Cant login in keeps asking me to login to authorise but keeps kicking me out to the same login screen. Needs fixing asap so my kids can contact family,
It just keep looping to login. Very frustrating as this is how I communicate with my children while they visit their father.,
Its really nice when your a kid and to just quickly contact other friends but socal media is a very bad thing and really no one should have it and any child the dose has the stupidest parents in the world.,
"For some reason, every so often it says I need to download the app in order to view the message from my granddaughter. How many times am I supposed to download it? Won't this take up too much space on my phone?",
this is not a bot its a really good app and i highly reccomend it to kids it doesnt let you use bad emogis and is perfect for kids so dont waste time looking at this and download the friggen app!,
I love this app very very much! But one of my chats are missing and won't come back! But besides that.... I love it!!,
crashes on chromebook and also my daughter's galaxy tab A. the older version would work on tablet until we updated the app.,
I am having trouble adding contacts and am generally not finding this app particularly user friendly.,
My daughter loves it. She can video chat with her cousins and family. And I like it cuz it needs my permission for everything.,
Its great but cant send videos to people also when you try to set it so your kids can find there friends it won't let you,
Your apps is SUCKS only few days after using kids cannot reply to this message suddenly I saw on google have lots of parent have same problem to much problem to use for me it's useless apps,
This game is amazing!it allows your kids to safely contact each 9ther but they have a time limit that you can set. As well so you kids dont be staying till 2:00am.So I gave this app 5 stars,
Any time I try to make an account it gives me an error I'll uninstall it but it. Says the same thing,
Wish we could uses downloaded pictures for a profile pic. Other then that this app is fine. Edit: Ok now im sick and tired of this app. The developer's are paying no attention to what we want in the app. This is dumb.,
"This app is totally awesome I can chat with My parents, friends and family just fine. No issues so far! KEEP IT UP YALL!!",
I like this application it is so fun and my kid likes it so much ‚ù§Ô∏è no ads it is great for my kid I will recommend it to everyone.,
all of a sudden it had said it stopped and when I tried to use it it wouldn't let me go into it.It only said uninstall and not open.I only give it 3 stars!,
"i can not get my child signed in for over a month , it says i have to up grade the app but ive tried that .. and the same message comes everytime .. you mjts update the app or sighn in from a mobil weeb browser ive tried both ?",
I like messenger kids because it's how I connect with friends but sometimes it's hard to update.,
"very fun, safe and did i mention fun? The only problem is that sometimes it lags but besides that i love this game!",
i think this app is good for your kids to chat with their friends. And it has kid friendly emojis on it.,
"Let me put gifs, I mean, what's wrong with a Spider Man gif, It cuts out any funny gifs. Even the ones that are age appropriate!!",
"Like this app, but I wish I could send any one of the emojis! Too glitchy and can't send all emojis",
Good app trying to install on a new device keep putting in the correct password and I cannot get it to log on very disappointed,
Good and easy to use,
this is a great app for kids no phone number or email just a fun name that you create with them thats why I rate this a 5,
"This is a very good app and idea of a app safe for kids. i get to text my friends,and family.üòÅüòÅ",
Update! If you're creating a new account like me the loop is not changed. Please fix this bug Facebook.,
"Is a good fun way for kids to communicate, some features missing/don't work - can't send them gifs, but they can send you them? Sharing videos off Facebook appears to work, but they can't see them? Can't change themes, react to their msgs...",
I'm trying to text a friend from school and I can't get to text her or find she sent me a message and I could not see it. FIX YOUR APP,
i love this app its great but ine thing is can you add it where you can delete text messages that would be great,
"Needs work. Great way for me to stay in contact with my grandchildren. Only been using for a few days and everytime I'm talking with them It asks you to rate them, with no way to dismiss.",
"This is horrible, videos are just a white screen and it won't let me view them. Update this immediately messenger kids! ü§¨ü§¨",
I love this app. It's a great way to connect and have fun with my grandchildren..I don't get to see them to often so this helps a lot,
Limits creativity and had corse awful stickers and games. Addictive for kids. Make sure you limit screen time.,
"It's so amazing I love all the games,activities, and filters so my family can have FUN.",
It won't accept password just keeps looping back to beginning. Can't use app.,
Hey could you add a thing so I can add his friends but it won't let me because I want I'm not able to search up their friend name,
Hate this. my kids cannot access this app and it keeps giving us so much grief about signing in. There's no one to contact.,
my kids have this app and when they try to make a group chat with each other they can't do it because they're not friends on Facebook which I find kind of stupid because my kids don't have Facebook so they can't find each other and now they can't create a group chat so they can talk to each other on messenger kids,
"easy to use, an great for keeping contact with your child/children, and parents can control the contacts/content an the account.",
"Absolute trash, will not allow you to log in or verify. No customer support.",
"so amazing,you can call text face time and more!no ads and it's easy to use!",
Cant login in my child. Gave correct credentials however it says user cannot login on this device. Really annoying.,
My child loves this app. I haven't had any problems with it and I feel my child is safely talking with friends and family.,
I like the app but can you add a feature where you can change the ringtone and notification sound?,
It is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! Though I wish it let you put in downloaded picture and not a camera picture,
"It's best app for kids, children friendly... Moreover, we have control over all activities üëçnice.",
Its fun for kids to call and text to everyone that like to. And it's good for parents to be there to.,
"Rlly good i kinda sorta think its messager but bigger, colourful, and the parents can see everything you write. One thing though my dad helped me set it up and i hv a chat with him and other chats for my friends but i can't seem to get a chat with my mum nither one of my parents know how to do this so... plz let ,e know or, something. Otherwise Grate app. Grate for kids of all ages.",
"Ok,I do not knowwhat the problem is but I think that a texting app should let you add friends.Whenever I put in the rights code it will just say ""somethin didn't work.try again later.""I HATE IT!!!!",
I love it because I can talk to a lot of my friends that I don't see that much I just wish u could add people on it with people's number,
I love this app because of this app I have make a lots of friends I was I have was having no friends but after installing this app I get new friends and now daily talk over there and we have edit some more new friends and now we have created a friend circle on this app and we have keep on a time to talk and a time is seven o'clock to 6 o'clock and we really enjoyed in that time so thank you I love this app and I will give 5 star for this,
This is a really good texting app for kids! There is kid friendly filters and more fun stuff to do!,
It's a neat app for my son to connect with his family and friends. I just wish that when I tried to add new friends for him it would allow me to find them.,
"Messaenger Kids is such a good app for kids (dUh) But anyways,Messenger kids lets kids text there friends and have fun or maybe even do rp! (DoNt JuDgE mE) But i feel like im going to enjoy this app very much. üòÄ",
I think this a good app especially when you cant see your friends or family during the pandemic.,
"Amazing üòçüôå I can text, FaceTime,and soo much ‚ù§Ô∏è MORE!!!!!! Downloaded it NOOOOOWW!!! YAAAAA!",
I like that I can call my daughter's phone they always miss place the house phone but they can hear that ring thank you plus she can talk to her cousins that live states away ‚ò∫Ô∏è,
Can't log in parent confirmation isn't working. Was working fine until accidentally logging out now can't log in,
"It will not load most of the time so I gave it only four stars but maybe that's just my table, but other than that it's a fun app that I highly recommend!",
Messenger is amazing you get to communicate with family and if you miss them so much you can even FaceTime them and it's so much fun when I FaceTime my friends my friends are so much fun to play with even if me and my sister are a part we can play Roblox together because we can talk to each other on YouTube kids never mind not YouTube kids I'm stupid don't read that part kids but I was just saying that too older people when they're when they're allowed to say bad words so make stupid and shut up,
It's really great has so much games fun things to do it's amazing awesome awesome awesome I think you guys should try. It's really good,
"Can't log in, I thought I might of been putting in the wrong password the 50 times I tried then I tried on my iphone worked instantly. Google what a shame she will be joining me as an Iphone user because this is ridiculous smh.",
this app is good but i cant see my friend when i try to text him he says that his parents sent a request and they did. my parents acepted it.but i cant seem to see him. pls help,
Its a great app there could be more colors audio call and etc. But for what it is its awesome,
"Fantastic app, but if you can please make it so it doesn't need Wifi, easier to contact my mom where I am. üëç",
its acting up i try to call nothing i cant see myself or the person im calling and its blank when i or they end the call its been fixed so thois review has no means anymore,
Love it it's a good way to talk with friends and interact even through this epidemic/pandemic/indemicüòÅ,
Pretty cool app where I can send text/pictures/ video with my kids.. i also can monitor who my kids add as friends.,
Its a good way to communicate with others and my daughter can't connect to my Facebook. :),
This app is amazing you guys really got to try this out because you guys are going to live off of it I have the most amazing people on this you guys should get its amazing,
this is an amazing app for kids to have fun with friends in a secure and safe world on they're phones.,
I love this app but there are some flaws it takes a lot of space so make sure you have some space on your phone before download this app.,
"It is like regular messager but you can't do some stuff like anime gifs, bitmoji, and more!",
I love this app cause when I got my first phone i wanted messanger kids and it was incredable to see that I was calling peaple and I love talking to friends to help each other with home work and I love the peaple that likes it too and I can spread my love to the world.,
It's not opening on my phone I open it with facebook but it's not opening I write my date they says there a problem I uninstall it and the install it and it's the sameüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,
"Super fun you can video chat, text people, and awesome games to play. This is my kind of app!",
Downloaded it on my phone and my daughters tablet. It won't even set up. Says it cannot find my account on either device. Ridiculous,
"Sometimes it works, others it doesn't, I don't always get notifications even though I have it set as priority",
Nice and easy to use,
I love this app! It is very useful when talking to friends and it is a kid friendly app!,
"It is the best app, for monitoring your kids. And bee tension free while your kids are on social network with family and friends, whatsapp should also introduce app like this.",
"I don't like it too much because I cant delete stuff and it always kickes me out saying "" the app is sleeping now sign in to another account "" it is ANNOYING",
This app is good. But the reason i gave it 4 star is because before 7:00 pm it keeps saying unabel to send. Please fix it!,
"I recommend this messenger app for all parents who are facebook users. You can keep track of every contact, conversation and picture sent.",
Amazing app to use for kids to keep in contact with family and friends while giving the parents piece of mind of who their child is talking to.,
Awesome app! I really recommend it. Just one problem that I hope can be fixed can you make it so we can delete messages?,
Zero stars. Won't even let me create an account for the login failures or whatever they are.,
well... this was a 5 ‚òÜ until the update... it no longer works on my sons Samsung s5. It works fine on S8 and 9.,
I love it because you can communicate with your grandchildren when you haven't seen them for awhile. You can also can see each other which is really neat. I love it.,
Usually a good app but we are having the same problem as others where it keeps looping back to the authorise account page,
I love it but my screen go black when I play and call at th same time,
"Will not allow app access. Tried on multiple devices and it continues to ask for parent to authorize, over and over again",
It's an amazing app for calling your friends and goofing around with the filters is so much fun,
Major breaches in the messenger services unfortunately that's how hackers get into your face book accounts.So not happy about the leaks but have friends that like it.But have deleted it at least 6times from breeches.There not secure in any realm.Cant convince me Facebook even cares about it either.,
Cannot log in. Keeps looping back to parent authorization. Tried in multiple devices. Please fix!,
It's a good app But it would've been better if there was no black screen when ever I play with my friend which is annoying,
It is so nice i have some of my friends on there and you can video call them as well you can text as well i love it,
I like this app bc it lets the parents choose who their kids can talk to. It also lets the parents know what is going with their children and if someone wants to be there friend. Before the kids see it,
writing this from PC and it says this app is for all devices but it wont let me download on my PC i am very disappointed and i would like this to be fixed,
Not working!! Settings too complicated... Much errors,
this is an extremly fun app u can textcall or face time but i dont like how i cant use my bitmojis emojis . but over all its fun,
This app is great but whenever I was in a conversation with someone it froze so I couldn't type.,
"i love this app. i love how my kids can only call and talk to who i approveüòÅüòÅ this is a GREAT APP. Perfect for your little ones when family, and or mommy or daddy are away. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK",
Keeps day ng something went wrong when creating your child's account !! A I don't wanna create my kids acouunt she has one but I can't connect via my Facebook Messenger and wanna connect to her,
This app is super cool it's good for connecting with friends and family try it out !!!!!!,
"This would be 5 stars, however some people are not loading. I am not able to see what I send them or see what they send me. How could I fix this? please answer back soon. i would really like to talk to my cousin.",
"AWESOME! I love this app I can text my freinds,and family on it!You can also play games on it and grow pets.It is a awesome app.",
its a great app just when your parents get the text and they read it it wont send you a notification telling someone texted you,
"Works fine on my smartphones. I really like this, although my son has yet to understand proper emoji usage üòÇü§òüòÅ",
I love how I can talk to my friends whenever I want and I can FaceTime them there's so many fun games on this and I love the funny filters and games where you can say send your,
"It was a bit difficult to navigate, it seemed like I wasn't getting anywhere, I did it a long time ago but never got a code till now,",
"So far so good appears to be age appropriate seems to allow filtering, and parental guidelines.",
My child loves to be with friends on calling apps she totally loves this app it really works for her she has a lot of friends üòä,
I love it! It's so good I can make groups I can literally add anyone I want and for kids if the best way and 4 Kids contact thank you for making this app,
I got this for my grandkids. I love that they can text and call from their tablets. I can control who has contact with him and review texts if I become concerned.,
My family loves this app! My kids are always talking to friends and family now. Best.Download.Ever!,
I have this on my tablet and it is so fun I have a few of my friends on it.The only thing I don't like is sometimes the mute button doesn't work.,
We can't search songs sense the last update it's really annoying it's good other than that.,
"It is a great app that I can contact my parents with, I think it is great for young children and helps with online bullying because your parents can see what your doing üòÄ",
This app is amazing my kid can call text and contact with her family and friends whoever made this thank you so much.‚ò∫,
My expirience with messenger kids is awesome! I just wish it was easier to add friends.,
Great way to keep in touch with friends and to have silly filters and games!,
Fun and safe so far. I love the drawing feature. My child loves it.,
"I love the security. The kids can stay in contact with each other, and family without being vulnerable to predators.",
when my oldest was 7 i wrote to facebook asking for this very thing ( a fb messenger app that connects to the parents account for kids...parent has to approve things. ) 5 years later here it is . wish i was part of the team...id have made some money! ha!,
Uninstalled from my daughter's tablet. Won't reinstall until there is an update to fix all the glitches.,
It's good but it locks so you can't talk to people at night,
"I'm trying to log in to tell my sister happy birthday and it says""this user can't log into this app"" of something like that but it's irritating",
"It doesn't send my messages 99.9% of the time, and it's crappy as hell. Don't recommend.",
Happy to call to may familya,
amazing quality and amazing voice quality everything is amazing i love it! and i love how its almost exactly like messanger for kids AMAZING!,
Very annoying. Have two kids and the app can't cope with two kids on one device!!!!!!!,
It literally logged me out of my granddaughter's phone plus my phone keep saying I need to enter a password I did the one step authorization everything and it's still not working I don't understand it this is how she communicates with her mother,
Fix this glitch. Makes my screen black when I get of the app let me and every kid play games with friend on different apps peacefully it suck,
"Tried to set it up several times and it failed when clicking ""create account"" every time. Trash.",
This app will not open. Just goes to a white screen and won't load anything.,
"Same issue as other users, logged me out and can't log back in, keeps looping back to log in screen",
Its great and all but I wish this app could allow 2 or more kids on one parent but otherwise this app is great,
My child cannot connect with their aunt. Both can not send messages to each other and we cannot figure out why. No issues with any other person.,
It doesn't work I was so happy when I saw it cuz I can record any game I wanted to play but it just doesn't work a clicked on it said it wouldn't work is that you need a 5.0 up and I don't have it so just won't work you guys should try it but I don't know if it's over for you guys if it does good jobs if it doesn't we'll just trying to find another video recording just like I am trying to do right now,
Great way to keep up and see who your child is talking to. You can also see what picture and videos are being sent wish you could view the messages,
Its a great app but you can't have a screensbot for your profile picture on a Samsung device.,
The calls are great but sometimes other people can't hear you but everything else is great!,
"Won't let my camera turn on,messes up so I can't hear the people I am talking to and the can't hear me.",
I love the games and that my mom is able to see what i am texting my favorite game is the unicorn game and that we can design it and all the other cool things i loveüòÜüòÜüòÜüòèüòèüòèüòÑüòÑüòÑüëçüëçüëç,
"Used This App Since My Grandkids Were Very Young. And,Used Tablets. Not Cell Phones, Like They Do Now!",
Every time I try to sign up I use my Facebook password and it says invaild credentials or invaild password I'm using the right password and it won't let me sign up FIX IT,
For me it would glitch quite alot When your scrolling through you text when you go 'to far' it will kick you off the app.,
"I have many young friends and family, yet I am not a mom or child. Very hard for me to use this app.",
It doesn't lag and I get to talk to all my friends without anything breaking that over facetime on the app,
"It's great although I think it doesn't need to be controlled as much as it is. As I am a parent, I think it is just a tad bit controlled.",
I think this is a good app and I love it And I like that I can check the texts and I can see everything they are texting so that it is appropriate,
My kids can talk to friends and family without me being afraid they can be contacted from anyone I won't trust. Great app to keep in touch with your love ones.,
Would be better if it had ability to only open with parent code and a favourite list for friends they contact often,
"Every time I go to creat the kids account, it always says to please try again. But when I try again it says try again,again. So I'm not happy,so no stars till you fix this.it made me put the one star",
"fun app for kids , stickers ,games etc. lots of fun video messaging each other .fun with filters. Enjoy",
This is a really good app for kids and lets them talk to their friend and i love this cause i got to talk to my friends alot,
1. When I text someone it doesn't show up 2. Can't delete messages After all its a pretty good app,
So far it has been amazing I can control everything right on my phone and the girls can play on it on their phones/tablets,
This is the most adorable app for kids. I love how they can communicate with family. Well done,
It is a very bad app .if you entered the right email they say that the email or passward is wrong they must fix that problem,
"During this time of social distancing, I miss my grandchildren so much. This gives both of and them to communicate whenever we want.!‚ù§‚ù§",
It's a great app.. You can only chat with family and friends that you add on their,
It wouldn't let me make an account saying the there was a error I've re downloaded the app didn't work I tried resetting my phone didn't work,
Can no longer use the app in Europe. Very disappointing. Is there an alternative European version?,
Same issue can't login child got new phone now she can't login and talk w her friends really annoying this still isn't fixed yet,
It's sooooooo use full! I love this app I can talk to my friends always! And I love my pet! I hope you like this app because it's so fun!!!!,
Verrry Fun app. Messenger kids is a extremly fun app! One of the best thing is that there are tons of stickers.I reccomend this app to every kid like meeee!üòçüòçüòç,
"My children have been homeschooling for a couple years now, and really enjoy being able to connect with friends. ü§óü§ó Thank You!!",
My kids love it but I cannot make a second account for my son. Really upset about that Used my separate account for my son's. Now I add people from that friend's list to his but it won't show on his tablet. Not even my main account,
I really like this app. Because you can textand play some games and etcetera... And because the parents are over who they text...,
"I can't a contact using a desktop. It is just saying ""having trouble completing your request""",
Great app but I'm missing filters and my friends have them soo if you can fix that that will be Great and yea,
App keeps on crashing every time I open it. Also why cant I remove images sent to me,
codes dont let parent aprove contacts you have to search and it ends up inviting a random lady with a name not even close to the kid you were searching to chat with your child and you cant cancel it untill she aproves,
I think this app is such a wonderful way for kids to talk to each other in a safe enviroment that can be trusted. As a parent I enjoy how my son loves this app and I cam still feel like he is safe while doing so.,
I love to talk to my friends and play roblox while we're talking. I also love this app beacause me and my friends love to play with the filters :),
Everything about it is awesome. But once I wanted to play grow your pet but it loaded FOREVER.,
Works great and I can see and control who she talks to . So she doesn't get stuff from strangers.,
It's okay but on the voice message thing like I can't do different voices like robot or like a singer or something can you fix that,
Good so far...but I'm having trouble getting back into it once I do something else on fb...could u add another tab for this app on the profile page next the the other messenger tab??,
"This is a good way for kids to contact parents, friends, and relatives without having Facebook! ü§≥üëçüëè",
It's a amazing app to communicate with family and friends and they add a new filter almost every day,
They need to fix the bugs whenever I call someone it makes it so I can only see the call in the corner its probably just my tablet idk,
it is a lot glitchy but it is so fun you get to face time text and you can also put on fillters awsome job messenger kids im very happy,
Good app but make that there is phone call not only camera call and make there is share screen all kids need it and wanted please add those things and it will be the best for kids,
I love it its simple and he has fun I think it's a great way for him and his older siblings to connect and bond...,
@messengerkids we are unable to authorise device from parents facebook account details ‚Äì stuck in a loop. This has been reported by many people all over the world via many types of social media. Please post something about what is wrong and how/when you,
This app is trash i try to log in my Facebook account it only lets my sister and I put my password it says this account is not allowed to log in this is trash I do not recommend downloading it its just a scam,
"kids messenger is great for my kids, you should join. it's great and kid friendly! 5 star review.",
Need to add audio call and need to improve stability like messenger .Need manual upload option for profile picture.,
I hated this! I do not have facebook and I would like to have children text please help with this thank you!,
I love this I FaceTime my mom every time and we do funny faces the reason why I love it because it has funny faces you can FaceTime your family and whatever your friend from school and everyone else buy,
I love I app it is so much fun but can you add more colors like black grey and white and add a stickers for profile but keep gallery lol,
i love it but it wont let my kid change the color of his texts. but its pretty good overall,
Sometimes when my mom or dad is calling me on here it doesn't show up as a notification and it got my mom worried can you guys fix that its been going on for a while now and its annoying,
This app is amazing is fun for kids to talk to there friends when there not at school I highly recommend this app.,
amazing! My daughter can finally talk to her closest friends and family! she loves this app and yeah,
"It won't let me sign in. It keeps saying ""account creation failure"" every time I try to sign in.",
Why do I have to approve someone over and over again and it still dont show up in their contacts? And also is there a way I can read her messages from my phone or even delete them from my device?,
I gave this app a 5 bc I have all my friends on it and no one can or will hack me or my friends you can play games talked picks and you can do what real messenger stuff can do I give it a 5 out of 5 thank u.,
"I think that this app is an amazing way to make sure that kids are save ,and an amazing way to see what they are texting people .",

Very protective and very useful staying in touch with friends and family members!!!,
"Beautifully awesome and beautiful and beautiful and very lovely and very nice and I love that little angel app so I am sure you will enjoy the pictures and the color, but secretly I love Messenger Kids.",
"its a great app, but I jsu wished when you went to start a groupchat your friends would have to be friends or it.",
"I like it alot, but why can't you use pics from your gallery? Overall really great app! Will update my rate if you make it so that I can use my gallery :)",
getting facebook ads 10 times day on my kids tablet and some of them not for her age. try blocking them without any luck. I'll have to delete this app. sorry no good,
Normally great for my kid but not he can't use since recent update - says you have to connect to internet regardless of being on wifi for data,
I love it l've been using this app for like 4 years and I've had no troubles the one bad thing about it is that it is a process to get someone on the messenger but out of everything else I love itüëç,
It let's me call and text my friends with many other games on it such as guess the picture and it's way simpler than the actual messenger,
Its a great app but I tried to open my child's address from another device and it didn't open.,
This is a great app but it needs to be easier to add friends like just scan something on the the other ones device,
Love that my babies can have a fun messaging app that i can monitor!,
Well the reason is that u need facebook and that app is only for boring Facebook mom who only understand....anyways if I were parent I would just let them use reg messages but the idea is nice a d there is problem with it once or ever,
"Such a great app,you can text and call on calls you get to do fun things with your friend i recomend this to everybody",
Love the secure connection for children. This ap makes it fun to connect with family and friends.,
"good but, i cant find my code. The spot where u r supposed to find your code just keeps loading and never stops.",
"When logging in, the app resets us back to the front welcome screen. Can't log in.",
Downloaded app wasn't able to use it correctly don't understand how this works,
"It's not working. Video call just closes, won't connect with a contact.",
I have a question so it is saying that there is a connection error and there isn't. But it won't even let me put in my email or log in so I was wondering if anyone know how to fix it!;,
"It's ok, but as the parent we should be able to see what our children and their friends are saying without having to get there phones",
This app is not a scam! This worked for me without putting in a phone number. All you need is your parents facebook username then choose which friends your parent wants you to chat with then you can chat with your friends!,
I like the app it is kid friends and helps me out but the filters sometimes concern me but otherwise this is a really nice app And there is no ads,
"The app is broken, can't even make an account. Never ending errors.",
"Where is the voice call button? And why can't you present your screen, put videos on, and do activitys in a call like normal messenger? Please add those features for messenger kids please! üòû",
Can't get passed the password part it's annoying even reset my own password still didn't work frustrating!,
I wish that I had the option to be able to easily read messages that my children send from my account without having to log into their accounts.,
Ever since it updated its takes forever and a day for any photos or vids my daughter sends me... Whyyyyy ugh!! üôÑü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,

It's sometimes glitch and i really want to call really want call my friends and it does not work but any way I love the app,
The app won't even open past the welcome page before it shuts down so I can't even create an account,
it is great because there are so many things kids can do and it helps also to text your family,
Awesome app for kids! Really enjoy using it. Very easy to use and is kid friendly!,
This app is awesome because anytime my mom needs help with something or when she's outside exercising and I'm watching my sister and brother and always tell her that they woke up or if I need help.,

I love this app but none of my friends can hear me please fix this bug,
"Best app for kids who want to text, my mom can see what I'm texting, really good app I recommend you trying it!",
There's a big glitch whenever I'm trying to make a video for one of my groups so please fix the glitch anyways great app!,
Hey this is great. But I wish it could be made easier so my child can call aunts and uncles too as well as cousins,
Amazing but I do wish that you could do the art tasks multiple times and not just once,
Everything works great. Just wish there was a content filter for age brackets,
I had to use Facebook to make an account and 1 I don't like Facebook and 2 I don't feel like wasting more space for something I'm not going to use so I'm not really like this app,
It's very good I can talk to my friends and we are still kinda too young to use those messing apps so great app!,
Love that my child can only add and communicate with pre-approved individuals and I can monitor the charts too.,
I like this app because it is a easier way to text your friends without having to get their phone number!,
"Its a great app that I'm the only person who can approve a contract,see the parents and see messages between each child",
This app is perfect for my daughter. She can talk to her best friend all the time now! Our family loves this app.,
Messenger kids is a awesome app theres cool games u can play and u can group chat people in a group To be honest i know its for kids but mabye it has to be less restricted but overall its a good app c:,
Fun but one thing that is annoying is that you can't save videos so then if you wanna save it you cant,
it's amazing kids can talk to each other on a video chat and text each other it has games and videos you can send to each other so I hope this helps you,
My daughter's use this app and they love it they get to talk to there family and friends The app is kis friendly . They can talk to there neighbor,
"I'll change my star rating AS SOON AS you fix this app. My daughter cannot call me or anyone else and we cannot call her. FIX THIS, PLEASE!!!",
Absolute junk. Stuck on the authorize loop and not a peep of help. Horrible product and service,
i think this app is great once in a while i can text my friend without having other random people texting me on Instagram.,
This app is amazing that actually like your kids download this if so like 6 or 7 cuz this is a good app so they could contact like good friends are like the family,
"Could not get it to connect to certain Facebook friends pages. Absolutely ridiculous, and also classic Zuckerberg garbage.",
Perfect for your kids devoce so they dont have to borrow yours to keep in touch lol honestly this app is a life saver. Not all heroes wesr capes ;),

It is really good and it is a good way to text and you could see what your child texts,
Very good app for children! You can chat with many friends and family! Thanks for making the APP,
I get to talk to friends without going near them so I write this app a five-star that's how good is actually it was possible I would rate it as 5 million cuz of this covid-19,

"This app is so cool but mom said this is comfortable from,me I said yes but, I can't add lol I wish this app could be like that but when I click the download she can't download lol i wish could never had this phone.......",
I had this app and u would think it would be good. It's really only good for kids 3-10 other wise it makes u feel like your being controlled! Your parents control everything and the filters are so childish. I'm a tween and dislike this app. If u are over 10 I really don't recommend at all! Edit: If u are under 10 it's fine nothing wrong. But if ur a tween really childish. Sorry if this came across rude it was not meant to just trying to tell u before u get the app Thanks for understanding :),
My 8 year old loves it! Especially the little games you can send to you're friends.,
So good. I am able to control my child perfectly and my child loves it. It's the best,
Can you fix your would you rather stuff cause some of it is cut of and sometimes i cant read it well so pls fix that and can you ad more activities pls and thx :) :),
I LOVE this app because I can talk to my friends and family and there is funny stickers so I really like and hope you do to,
I used this for 3 years and its very good! But you could add new filters tre boring!,
"I really like messenger kids!!! But I only gave it 4 stars because somtimes when I press to go into kids messenger it go to play store,and says installing and I have to wait..... and somtimes it just stops and won't let me in. ....why?",
"Great way to keep tabs üìë n who is contacting your kids. If I don't know the kid who is texting him, I ask to see all text written from that source.",
"Great app to be able for family to stay in touch with grand kids, nieces and nephews and great-grandkids, Aunts and uncles.",
Having the same issue as everyone else I go to login and it just sends me back to the log in screen,
Perfect for my daughter! I love the control i have over the contact and the messaging.,
Awesome for kids to talk to their friends and family. I like it for my kid to talk to her friends.I really recommend it,
I it's fun I like it but there's one problem üòÖ you can't delete any of your messages even if you go like Yes dear yeah it's really fun you can't have your boyfriend here it's like no girlcan have your boyfriend and because he wants to marry you and we can't marry üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,

Four star love this app this is the kid but I think you guys can let us use bitmoji it would be much more fun and you could proboly inprove on that .,
would like to be able to track the phone or device when it has no data or phone number basically just using the GPS on the phone,
"Technical, I've been trying to make an account for my daughter with technical issues. Was hoping she can contact her dad through here.",
I can decide who my daughter talks with. People cannot send her links to outside sources. The app keeps my daughter safe and secure,
This app is amazing my kids use it every time I quess I'm telling as 5 stars thanks to the creator of this app!,
This app gives my son the ability to keep in contact with his friends without a cell phone and its monitored by me which I love,
I have this five stars because I am I child that has a hard time finding her friends on Skype. It's way easier because then RANDOS don't come on my acc hunting me down.,
"I love it, I think it is great for kids across the seas so then they can be in touch with their bff or friend any time.",
we have problems with messages kids because it ends call with no reason and it keeps freeing up and it doesn't keep working for a call or a text,
This game is so fun because you get to text people.you can text your family and friends. You can also call your friends and family,
I love the ideal of this app so kids can talk to their friends and family and the parents can watch it..,
Good for communication. Now it is saying aplication not installed. Need to fix some stuff. No bad words? Why is that in.,
I think this game is awesome and but I have one suggestion maybe we could show our screens while playing some thing,
I love it! But add more accessablety to Pixel/Android phones and not just Apple please!,
Is just so cool you can call people and their friends and everybody I'm just eight and it's fun a good app for kids I even call my cousin but now I don't even have it but I download it back,

Great way to keep contact with your children who aren't quite ready for wide open messenger apps.,
This is great because i moved to a different state and i cant talk to my cousins but now i can! This app is great!!,
It is the best app ever and no ads and I love this so much that I will delete all my games just for Messanger Kids!,
It's safe for kids and uou as grown-up you can text your kid or kids! üòÄüòÄüòÑüòÑYou have to set up a account for them and download the app!,
This is a great app for kids but need to have it on a desk top computer can you advise how to get this downloaded please. :),
I love messenger kids I also agree with the other comments that say only iPhones get the updates and I don't have an iPhone so I wish that that could change like that we could get the updates just like iPhones.,
It is a good app but it gliches a lot and my camera does not always work but overall I rate it a three,
I give this app a four because its a good app its just if i dont want to text that person anymore i cant remove them (i dont think i can) but overall its a amazing app,
"Terrible app. I have to use my moms facebook account, and she doesn't even have one! Please make an update so that we do not need our parents facebook account to make an account! Whoever made this app is an idiot.",
Has been working great and would give 5 stars except the Sleep Mode has stopped working! Please fix!,
its not the best app ever but I still like it I have to update like every week to get the photos to work.üòê,
This app is awsome! Atleast to me nothings wrong... I have a friend that cant come over often so i text her and call her a LOT ‚ò∫üòá,
App is garbage it won't let me back into my daughter's account stating there's an error with no solution on how to troubleshoot!,
This app can be annoying and stupid when I try to log in all of my contacts are gone.,
Love this for my kids. Great way to be able to safely interact with family and friends without having to have social media.,
Sometimes in the video chats you have to re call the person because they can't see you otherwise this app is great,
"Unable to create a child account. The account creation error simply states ""Something went wrong while we were creating your child account. Please try again later.""",
This is AWSOME so much diffrent options and I can talk to my child even though I do not have this amazing app!!!,
Its GREAT for little kids who want to be able to chat with family and friends! i love using the app,
It's not working or loading text i have had this app for a bit and the only way I can talk to my friend is on here plz fix it,
Is very nice for younger kids to connect and to have fun together except that the kids yell at me because of the sleep mode so i would like for you to take that away,
"I get to talk to my siblings that have a I pod and they can't text Androids. Now, I can text them and face time them.",
This app is awsome for me and my buddies at school it's a good idea to make a messeging system for kids to contact kids. So heres 5 stars!,
It's a good kid safe app but I wish you could save videos in the app,
Perfect for kids instead of Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat you get to use this very use full and great bcs you can grow a weird pet but it is still fun,
"i liked this app I got to talk to a lot of my relatives but it is so hard to make an account. To be honest I think this app is way too overprotictive, but I liked this app a lot :)",
"I can't even create an account It's really annoying my little sister can't even talk to her friends, it's just really frustrating.",
"I love it alot it gives my children a opportunity to feel just like grown ups so I would give it if there were more, üíØ",
I love that this app allows my child to video chat their grandparents and friends safely without risk of them communicating with strangers!,
I think this app is amazing i love talkinf to my freinds on this app in sted i dont have to wait till mon. The auther thing about this app that i love is it makes talking more fun insted of taking nomal!!! That is my opinon!! üòçüòúüòÑüòÑ,
The app is amazing but i accidentally logged out of my account and i cant log back in do you know why this is happening?,
I gave a three beacuse i get dissconected a lot and the game are really bring but what i like about it is that i can call my freinds every day but there radom people popping up on my phone and i don't really like that they act super nice,
This sucks it logs my daughter out i dont know why but and it doesnt load sometimes AND she wanted to get her bestfriend on it and i pressed it and it just deteld everthing!,
"It use to be good until I can no longer access my kids account through my own app like before. I try to log on to view their chats and it tells me ""something went wrong ask a grown up""",
The only bad thing is on a tablet the pop up menus for stuff doesn't really work.,

It helps your kids be safe and u can as a parent u accept the friend request so very good app and my kids love it if have a high rekemdashon.,
"i have to use messenger to call anyone, my phone is messes up. i belong to facebook have an e mail and password, but still can not set this thing up.",

To many limitations,
I love this app.i have this app since 4 grade.its safe 4 me to and the games are so funny and wen you texte a bade word it nose that so it doesn't srnd the message,
5 star super fun games and it is free also you can chat with friends and family also your parents or the person that set up the account for you can control who you texted to and see what you're doing so that you stay safe ‚ò∫Ô∏è,
Known glitch where new devices cannot be authenticated. Facebook needs to fix this!,
"So, basically my childs chats are never sending to her friend it says ""unable to send"" and also it'll work then say that and they wont send so please fix that thank you!",
App won't let me open an account. I have followed all of the steps. Seems like a common problem.,
I love to talk to my friend in the video call but my friend and i cant call each other because she's having difficulties and when I call her she doesn't pop it up on my screen or her screen and when she calls it doesn't pop up on my screen and if I'm in my favorite game playing and she calls doesn't pop up on my screen so I don't know that she calls me.,
"I give this app 5 stars brcause my tablet witch is not a apple did not have a texting app so i was like what texting apps can i download so i just ignored it then i went to youtube and the add for messenger kids came on so i pressed on it and got it loged in and it was amazing and i am really enjoying my time with messenger kids,üòÅ",
love it best way for my daughter to get to know her father. who lives across the country. very safe app and it runs great.,
It's such a great game I get to talk to all of my friend especially when it was the middle of coved!! It works very good you should get it!,
"It's reallly great. However, when I send my daughter a message she doesn't get the notification. Is there a way to fix this?",
This app is really good for kids to talk to friends and family! It helps kids understand that they are not alone. This app is awsome,
Best ever but when your talking it repeats you can you fix it and it makes loud a screeching sound its annoying,
"Needs improvement, it will be cool if we could add other parents or guardians without them being our Facebook friend",
good but it's not because it allows kids to block each other,
This is super good but when i call someone it keeps saying connecting! Its suoer annoying can you fix this?,
Something went wrong and idk what to do!!!!! Help me pls!!!!! I dont like it until it works I HATE,
Not able to type messages. Have Uninstalled and re installed it twice and its still not working,
"Great, but... You need more missions! Also, is the filter in the picture of a video chat a cat or dog?",
It's a easy safe way to communicate with friends and family.Its easy to use and set up.But why can't parents send GIFS?,
i just loved it it was safe educational and fun! rhey should make a whatsapp kids.this app also dosnt need sim to call or text please get this app for your childüòÉ,
It's so amazing I talk to my friends all the time I even video chat all the time some tablets don't work when you install it but mine does‚ò∫,
great for kids to use but maybe let kids search up there friends instead,
*DANGER* Tons of spam even after uninstalling app. I get 6 - 8 text messages every hour to finish installing app.,
I think it is a good app to be in the app store and I don't have a good ipad cause it does not work good too!,
"I really like it it's a great way for kids to communicate one thing is, there's a grow your pet ge that shuts my phone do when I open it",

"Download because we got a note home from a classmate asking to join. Cant even log on, so frustrating!",
This app has helped me communicate with my friends near and far. Much faster than by letter!üòéüòú,
I love this app. My children are able to chat with family and friends and I feel safe enough doing so because everything has to be approved through me first.,
Won't even create an account and been trying for 2 weeks. Just keeps saying there's a problem try again. This is the worst.,
"This is great I can talk to my friends long distance, call my mom and ask her to pick things up!BEST APP EVER!!!!",
It's amazing because you can text and you can video call and you can send voice messages and you can take photos,
Very disappointed this stopped working & no longer allows u to log in. It was great while it worked üôÑ,
This is way more complicated than it should be. Cant add other parents to the Account later!!,
It needs to let us send links of YouTube to our kids. Rather than that the app is great,
I like this app it is nice and safe for kids so they don't be messaging strangers and getting in all kinds of danger,
it would not load it took ages for me to call someone when someones phone hung up it still kept ringing until u hung up i hate this app i dont recommend it to anyone at allllll,
It's ok the graphics are not amazing but definitely a fun app to message your friends üòù I recommend either messenger kids and normal messenger,
Well the app is good over all exept this one filter that is making my phone glitch badly you need to get rid of it it is the 5 filter,
i like this app because you can call people text and draw pictuers he part i dont like is tha when someone texts you it dosent tell me but i still like this app.,
Great way for kids to interact with fanily and friends without having all the features of traditional facebook.,
Great app. Allowes me to chat with friends. The one downfall is the stupid auto correct.,
"it's not working for me won't even let me see the messages kicks me off after like a second, hope it gets fixed",
GREAT app im actually 8 years old and i use it altho on tablet when u get on online game the call ends i use a phone i used to use tablet tho.its a great app!,

"It's a amazing app, but I got logged out of my account randomly like a year ago and , I was making a new account then it says something like ""Error, we were not able to make your child's account"" what do I do?",
Cant add accounts for my other children. It only let me add 1 account. I have 3 kids that are old enough to use app,
I love it but I cant delete messages but its still good download this for your kid if you want them to talk with their friends,
It's been really easy messaging .you daughter of I need something and it's really educational too,
"Pretty good app Jk amazing app ,I can video call with my brother, and my friends ,and cousin , and it is fun it hase stickers and ect",
It has given my kids the freedom to talk to their friends during the Corona virus. It has helped them get to see them since they cannot see them in school. Would recommend this to any parent,
This app is great my 10 and 7 year Olds are so happy they can talk to their friends but with the colours they should ad tye dye.,
This app is really good!the camrea too!when sometimes I get bored I can call my sister because of this app!some of it's confusing...but other than that it's great,
"I love this app, but I wish their were more face options. But other than that, this app is great!!!",

Can messenger cycling bad for texting so like lobster monster magic you should download it for kids like we can talk I have a lot of friends on their friends don't you answer me but like it's pretty nice but like yeah,
"For the last hour this app keeps saying ""Account Failure"" ""unable to create account "". How do you fix this?",
"It's a good app, but it won't let me add more than 1 child.... it's just one child per app.",
Okay I want to write messenger kids and I really like the camera thing so I just don't know what I like so I really like this and you're always has a drawing game and I play it.,
I like the app it let's me call and text but I can not see when people text me I do not now if it is just ipad.,
Perfect texting app I use it every day to call my friend very high quality video and other funny features,
I am unable to change the incoming call notification sound. It is pissing me off.,
It's great but the only problem is you have to update it whenever it needs it or you can't see anyone on the face time,
Nice app but can you allow the kids to share their screen and unsend videos and messeges so the person their texting cant see the texy or video please add these feature please im begging,
Wonderful experience! Like to suggest putting control of video access on the parents dashboard.,
It is only from Facebook account but i have 5 Childrens so it is helpful for me and please not include facebook account and its not end to end encrypted so i not recommended to all,
This app is amazing. I love how it's so safe for kids. My daughter absolutely love this app. And i love that i don't have to worry about her,
I love this I would download this doooo it it's a five star! It does not glitch so fun to play you have so many game and you can make groups,
Great app! I like it how my child gets to message to their friends and family.,
"It dosent let me text my friends when i try to send a text it says ""unable to send"".",
It is good to talk to friends but on one consorn its so slow and it makes my divide go silly and I don't like it üôÅüò≠üò¨make it better pliz,
The app is great but plzz can you put back in video call the alien filter de orange one it actually looks like a mosquito or ant head,
Its very safe and your child is gonna have so much fun with this app I love it you can do pictures with filters and amazing download it for free today‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§üíúüíúüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,
A safe way to teach a child about messaging. The kids enjoy feeling independent about using this app.,
I don't have a phone so i can't see my friends because the corona virus so this changed i get to see my friends it changed i finally get to see my friends yay! 5 stars!,
This is such a great app it allows kids to take to freinds take photos whith filters and ya if you need a app for your kids to talk to others on this is the one,
I am trying over and over to log back in and it wont let me!!!!!! This is really frustrating!!!! I have tried on my phone my daughters AND the computer!!!!,
"i am beyond disappointed with Facebook regarding this app! i consider myself strict when it comes to allowing my kids to use apps. i never EVER would have thought that someone could ""accidentally""send pornography to a child account through messenger kids! my child received pornography from a friend her age and YOU DID NOTHING by not adding extra protective layers of security and screening to messages sent and received. i am angry and will be deleting my own Facebook as well in protest.",
When I try and add contacts it doesn't load so im not able to add any at all.,
It won't let me play the games and sometimes it says people are offline when they aren't other than that I love the app.,
Great app I did loose my effect on my call and picture so that's why I gave it 4 star if you could helm me with that and the other people other than that the app is perfect,
hard to find other parents and contact them for friendship. but it works super well within the family circle.,
When my friend shows the music button and when I try to do it I dont see it but everything else is awesome üëçüòêüòëüòÑüòç,
Super great app for the kids they can stay in contact with family now that we cant see them as much,
"Great app, it allows me and my great granddaughter to keep in touch with each other.",
This app works! but sometimes It is wayyyyyyyy to glitchy and I have to restart the app even on calls.,
My child receives no notifications when I message him. No audio or pop up notice at all.,
Best app ever to talk to friends and family if either you don't have phone or messages or if they don't have phone and messages,
This is a great app you can chat with your family talk to your friends its great! I recommend this app.,
There is something wrong with it at the moment. Won't let my daughter back into it. I have re downloaded the app and I can't get back into it,
Awesome and it's just that like kids can really explore and text their friends and is controlled by parents is 100% safe,
It's great for your kids because they need to talk to people and it really helps them and they love it and I think you should get it for your kids I love it for my kids and it will make the day it's just a really really fun app and they can talk to them please I can call them and I just think it's a app that you can use when you need it.,
"I couldnt even sign in!! Why they have only facebook sign in? I didnt think my parents will allow so i tried to sign in myself. But because of the stupid facebook password, i couldnt!!!",
The best best messenger kids and I love it so guys need to use it but if it's a user's not looking like it's not working like messenger and I love you,
It just stops letting me send stuff. I'll send something and instead of saying delivered it says sent and doesnt send all the way,
üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòö‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÄI use this app like a million times a day and its so much fun so like if youdont have text this is perfect its like text but funner like it has filters and parents can see your messages its so nice,
It keeps telling me that the internet isn't working but it is. I deleted it and then installed it and it still won't work !üò≠,
Awsome game! But the reason I gave this a four star rate is because the filters aren't working please respond and please fix it,
I do feel however you should make it so you can do more then just one person in video chat make it like two or three can video together for the child,
App did great for a week but now wont allow video calls and is constantly crashing,
"Will not let me sign in for my nieces account. Takes me to sign in, but after doing so goes right back to the first screen.",
Can't login or authorize phone. Have tried uninstalling and changing password for no joy.,
"Worst app ever!! I tried logging in my child but it just keeps saying ""account creation failure"" please fix this!",
It fun sp many things to do but you cant delet messages when you send them to the wrong peson because i have done that many of times.,
it is so much fun for my kids! I love that there friends got to see each other! :),
"Great messaging app! I love using it, and it's completely free! Would 100% recommend!",
"i love this app! its fun, its not laggy, its likeable. i could okay on it all day. Perfect!",
Highly recommend this app has my kid connect with our friends and family but it's a little laggy that's the only problem,
It's alright but when I try to login in my Facebook account but it said No internet connection but I clearly am connected to strong and protected Wifi,
So I don't know how to log in it was hard the facebook of my mom was hard when I played roblox it reset I couldn't talk or chat with my cousin Mary and I delete it then restart reset again not fun,
This is ridiculous what if a parent does not have Facebook account and there child can not get in you need to be able to sign in with google because this is a good way for your children to talk to people you need to be able to think out of the box can you please let this app be able to sign in with google I am very disappointed in this app and I hope you get this request,
"Having so much trouble setting up on my child's tablet, wont let me complete the process, keeps saying something went wrong",
Awesome app! Gives you complete control. Be prepared to receive 400 voice calls from your 5 year old when she spends the night at grandma's.,
I was having fun until I accidently logged out when I logged out I decided to log back in and continue to talk to my friends but I saw that I had lost all of my friends I tried everything to get back but nothing worked please help,
Love it can make groups of friends and especially during u can still video call and with ur friends!,
Just a really nice app for my son to talk to his friends he said its a nice app to talk to his friends through it.,
This app is amazing I can talk to all my friends and family and it's so fun I love the filters and games.,
it is really good and the update is cool but my only problem is you took Away the color changing optionüòûplease please please add it back,
its an amazing app but i cant figure out how to add contacts and not friends.,
It sucks it just wants Facebook it sucks it just sucks only if you have Facebook but if you don't have Facebook it won't work it won't see Google any other stuff like Instagram Twitter racing,
My stepson has been using this and it cool and all but there's no games in the filters like the original messenger.,
You can call your friends on the app it's really good game so you can see your friends even if you're really far away.,
"I can text my friends but i like sending emoticons and also latley its saying ""not able to send text"" its so annoying",
"Great way for my little one to keep in contact with family and friends, especially during this time where she cant see them in person",
i liked it because it has very nice parent controls and It's very useful for my children.,
I totally recommend this app but the only thing I wish is to be able to have a downloaded image as your profile photo other then than it's awesome,
I can't even get it to work I wish I could give 0 stars. I have put in everything and it keeps going right back to saying authorize. Fix it.,
"The app just doesn't work, no matter what you do you end up in an infinite login loop to authorize a device for your child. This is ridiculous.",
I do like it but ever time she try to text me there is no notificaci√≥n and it randomly deleted the app please fix it?........,
I love how easy this app makes it for my 9 year old to safely talk to friends and family.,
Same problem as everyone else. Keeps looping back to the login screen.,

this app doesn't make sence! I just wanted to text my sister but it wouldn't even let me sign in even though I'm using my real Facebook account! this app is awful!,
This app is very good for your kids to talk to there friends without having to use our parents phone.,
You can talk to your friends and everything so I give this a five out of five so yeah it's a pretty good app for your kids to talk with their friends!,
"I have this on my ipad, but I wanted to get it on my phone, but I had to ask my parent to do the Facebook part. I think there should be a login for when you have to get this app, but on a different device.",
"lets my child interact with friends amd family in different states! she loves it cause its social media, i love it cause its safe for her!",
Super slow downloading I dont like it if it could have faster downloading it would be better way way way better app.,
This is a great app. It lets you keep up with your child in every way and give them a way to keep intouch with friends and family.,
"Very nice app. My kids love it too, they can reach out with granny abroad..",
OMG THIS IS SO AWESOME!!! ME AND MY COUSINS CAN TALK AND PLAY AT THE SAME TIME!!!Only problem is that I have very bad wifi.so I can't do much but talk really,
I love the app but the password and the one time password aren't working I type it in and I type it in right then it sends me back to the Login screen when I type the password in right please fix this,
it is so fun seeing my kid playing with her friend she never gets to see her friend so this is the prfect app for her to talk to her friends and cuaes.,

"This is the best way to text people it helps kids connect with their child's I rate it a 5 becaus you can also change you tex5 colour Best ga,e ever",

I love it since corona virus started I haven't been able to see my friends but on this app I can call my friends without getting sick,
I love this app so much but there is one thing I kinda won't some ringtones or something to make it cooler. Other than that it's awsome,
Great way to communicate with your child when your not there at the moment. Great safety features that I can control. GOOD JOB MESSENGER,
You can have group chats and you can play games and you can send things to play like TikTok toe and you can face time and there is funny filters and games to play on face time and you can add people or delete them.,
It's a good app but half the time my messages don't appear and it crashes.,
"Do not recomend! I TRIED TO SIGN IN BUT IT DIDN'T LET ME! I had an account but I uninstalled the app and I would like an ""Login"" button.",
Its okay but i dont like how it wont let you do longer videos and show videos that are long please update that thank you!..,
Any time I try to sign in so that my daughter can use it it says that I'm not a parent account and that I can't sign in!,
"Good app for texting, but the games nor the ""grow your pet"" work. Please fix this.",
on messenger kids its sooo fun bc like you can call your friends on it and the not fun thing about it is sometimes you have a timer but its still fun to chat on with ur friends i play roblox while im on call with my cousins and my friends!!!!!!! so byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee thats how i like kids messenger,
You can still curse fix that but everything else is good idk but it kept glitching and it automatically hung up in a call but except those it's all good üëç,

It is great! My daughter can talk to all her friends and I just make sure they say nice things,
"It's really nice, but it won't ring when a message is sent to you. It's really annoying, so please fix it",
It's not letting login so my daughter can talk to her friends. Can we please fix this bug so it can be used again,
I really like this app the only thing i dont like is that i cannot use some GIFs or stickers that are on normal messanger i miss my pusheen is is,
"This app is good ,in the pandemic my child was able to sustain the relationships that she has with her friends",
It's a nice app just I would like to be able to upload pictures from my gallery as my profile picture.,

I love this app even my son also likes it and the stickers are good in this app if your finding a app to talk to your child use this one,
This app is the best I love it no glitches and no ads this is like the best for kid and parents can even see what there child do,
app keeps crashing on my daughter's chromebook. opens amd then shuts down immediately.,
Downloaded to use on my Google Chromebook & after opening app it crashes. Unable to utilize app.,
its useful to see and u can do some games on it and with this quarantine I can facetime it's so fun and good if u r a kid,
I think this is a great app other than messenger you can chat and call other people and friends this app is great for my kids.,
Its a good app i had it on my old kindel but my mom deleted face book so now i cant log back in and there is no other posible way to log in or use the app,
It's good because kids can call text and share there ideas to friends messenger kids is just awesome!,
This app is good because you can talk to family and friends frome fare away and you can play miny games and you can grow a pet so i recommend this app for you. (It is fun to),
"It's a great app if you just have one child, but I have yet to figure out how to link more then one kid and keep it separate.",
Can't log in keeps asking for password and when I put it kicks me back and asks for password again. Frustrating,
Messenger is the best thing ever you can talk to your friends easily and sometimes it says yes or no to hang up I love it,
"It's the coolest and it's super helpful and pleas make an up date like the maze runner up date pleas it wold make the app 1,ooo times cooler",

My kid loves it shes always on it blowing my phone up hahaha never thought I would have to block my kid just to get my phone to stop getting blown up phone call after phone call from her hahaha,
Its awsome you can talk with your kids they can talk with our family or simply just there friends. Its great for the kids during quarantine.,
I love this app cuz I moved and now I can't see my bffl lily alot only at school and sometimes on the weekend I go for the night but this made it alot easier to see her,
It's a nice ap and my grandson loves the emojis but you can't use Gifs in it. Please try to add some of them for the kids to use.,
It is so good for kids to contact each other also family and friends very good idea.,
It is so cool for my child to communicate without random people texting it's great in my opinion,
Great app. for parents and their kids. Easy and simple to use. Messenger kids allows parents to view every conversarion their child is has.,
This is awesome I've full access and I can video my son anytime. Helps tons when I'm away from home.,
So far so good! 3 kids on it! We like it very much because we see everything they do using the app.,

This app is great it let's me talk to my friends and all but there is a little bug it's signed me out and won't let me back in.,
Good for my kids but it doesnt rotate with the screen which is frustrating as my tablet is set up like a laptop,

"This messenger is overall pretty nice, but whenever I add someone new, it removes them. Please fix!",
It's an awesome app to help the kids stay connected with friends family and be safe at the same time,
I have so much fun with my friends and family so many games to play it's amazing 5 start app it's perfect for all ages,
Unable to use without a Facebook. I guess I'm the only parent without Facebook. Useless app.,
you can make faces with the pitcher and you can chat with any one so i love it it is my faviorit app i am a child but i love it so parents out there you should get the app for your kids it is on any device,
It's fun and my daughter can talk to her friends before my daughter was saying mom I'm bored mom I'm bored but now she has somebody to talk to especially when school is closed like now because of covid 19 and if I didn't find this app she would be bored and bordering me to do something thing fun event if I tired now I got this app and there is no more problems,
It's amazing and has no adds at all the only problem is when you video call it sometimes echos or touches,
i have unlimited data and your app is telling me i dont when i do and that only happens when i update my picture please fix,
I think it is good but only one thing it is hard to get in can you make it easier but everything else is good,
Unable to see photos all information is missing. Fix the problem.,
So this is a bug in the game when me and my friend can't play the games on call so I hope you can fix it,
So I love it but I would like to be able to call like out it up to your ear I also want face time to to stay but be able to put your phone up to your ear but the rest I love,

"Does not get passed login page, logs right back out. Fix it or delete the app!!",

"This app is really good I use it as a 10 yr old I think this app is a 5\5 becuase it is protective and makes sure no bad behavior is used and it lets you report sombody if they are being mean,inapropriate or even more but no matter what happens on this app fun or not fun I always fell protected.

"If your Facebook account hets hacked or deleted your not allowed access to kids messenger anymore. Tried to make a new account with all new information and still not allowed. Your 100% banned. No one to contact either.

The app was good but when my kid did not want the app anymore she deleted it but her account is still on my is still on my contact list so how to I take her off,
Too difficult to use. I have been trying for over a week now to try and get my child hooked up and using the messenger kid. It certainly is not user-friendly.,
the restrictive nature is nice. would be nice to be able to manage teacher/tutor type contacts,
I'm trying to remake my son's account and it keeps failing. I've tried on two different devices.,
I like the app very much. It is a good app for kids. But it should include nicknames üëåüëå,
Needs a bit Moore protection with kids data but still fun and on going things to do,
"Eek, Its great. I can text my friends whenever I want! Just started today, I already love it..",
Would be 5 stars but when I try to log in it says ''This account is not allowed'' or something but its really good.,

Very good. Would have rated 5 star but some kind of bug hit the app and it wouldn't let me go into the app. So I deleted and Reinstalled,
It's super fun I have it on my iPad as well as my phone! If I could rate it to 10000000000000000000000000000000 stars I would!,
I love this app so my kids can talk to their friends but it can be very slow at times,
I'm really creeped out by some of the filters and I want all the older filters back so us kids have more. My mom is even scared of some of the filters. Three star.,
Very good experience I like that I can FaceTime people with out having to set everything up,
"Good, you could just add mpre stuff to it to make it not so boring. Other people have suggested stuff, so look at those",
This app Is really cool. but I just don't like the fact that u have log in with Facebook. I don't even have Facebook,
This app is unreliable. Half the time it doesn't work (send messages),
I love this app I can text my mom my dad it is fun because the games in itself are very good for you and your kids will get smarter when they play it Thank me for the support Your welcome,
I would rate it 5 stars but there is a glitch where I can't call my friend but although ITS REALLY GOOD,
I rate it 4 stars because i love it i would have of gave it a 5 star but the only thing i dont like is when you want to get your friend but its says you have to get their parent from Facebook,
Really good especially for lock down I can talk with friends and not be risking catching covid 19!,
"Good but it has some issues with calling, like the sound isnt very good.",
Love it. I have added all my daughters friends and our family so she can call them to talk anytime.,
It's a really really REALLY good app but it takes up a lot of space and that's SOOOOOOO annoying,
Terrible. I am a grandma trting to use this APP to unteract with my granddaughters whi eachchave accounts. It is impossible. It keeps asking for the name of my child.,
"I have been trying to create an account for my child, but it fails constantly. No point to this app if it doesn't even work.",
Fun for kids and teens and really it's good for kids really not for teens but like you can talk to your friend and everything I just love kids messenger don't you,
it's a very good app but it won't install on my computerüò≠ so if you want it one your computer it wont work,
It's a fun concept but they don't seem to have an easy way to switch between multiple kids accounts. I'm still trying to figure that out.,
Just wish I could change the theme like with Facebook messenger! So my son could have fun with it!,
The app is glitchy because I it says that I have to do Facebook account thing,
i love this app so much i can chat with any one but i gave this app 3 stars because i can't delete any messege and i need a code to find any one from my friends.,
"Deleted immediately today. My child's iPad is at home with no one there (checked cameras to be sure) the message was sent to me ""I'm with a girl"" when I didn't respond it said again ""do you not understand I'm with a girl"". Well I'm with my child and the iPad is at home with no one. So I'm assuming somehow it was hacked. HOW SCARY!",
This is a good app but when I try to change my PFP it doesn't work so fix that! But overall its a good app,
ILove this app üòç if you don't have it you need to download the app. And if I didn't get this app I would not be able to call or text my friends. When I first got this app I loved it by the Minette,
It got rid of at least 75% of the fun features and doesn't have the ones they show in the video.,
Its not bad at all i like it alot but sometimes it messages me and says this person is online it gets a little anying.,
Great app to enjoy you time talking and chatting to friends and family,
Tech issues with parental controls. Would have given 5 stars if i could actually get the parents dashboard.,
"Good app for kids to chat, message and call friends My and daughter's experience with this app is awesome üòäüòä I am impressed by this app Thank you hangout ü§†ü§†",
very easy to monitor and I have to approve who she talks to. also I can see her messages on my phone,
good but lagey,
AMAZING.My kid really misses her friends so I downloaded this app.She can chat with friends and family.Best part:I can make sure she is safe,
Is fun you can talk to friends and you have stickers. It also has games,
All ot did is load and load and nothing happends it's a 2 star becuse at least it's not just a blank screen!!,
Its horrible ifs always disconnects you even when wifi is perfectly fine and its lags a lot somethings are good but that part upsets me üôÑ,
its great for my kids and very safe and i can see what my kid is texting and what there friends send to her 5/5 would download,
Can't log in. Keeps asking for verification I even reset my password but nothing. It's been two days now. üò™,
This app is so good for kids. My grandson Facetimes me at least once a week. I love it!!,
"It would be amazing if you could make a snapchat for kids, with this exact same platform and characteristics!!!",
It is very awsome on a iPad but on laptop it does not really work for me for some reason.,
It won't work at all. i have a chromebook and already had an messenger account but now it wont open at all!,
All that happens is my cousin's spam calling me you can't ever let it ring out it takes forever if it was more like a normal calling app if like it more,
its a good game but sometimes it just turns white like a white screen or i cant text anyone for like a month and i cant even downlode it,
My babys account is not created with this app if i created then i get pop massage account creation failed something wrong while we were creating your chiled account. Please try again ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è,
This has sounds on my iPad and no sound on my phone?! My friends kids have no sound either pls fix!,
We have been unable to log in for over a month. I have sent multiple emails about the issue and have not gotten any response back.,
1stars because i hate when its a sleep mode for me its just annoying because im in a call with my friend it auto hangs up during a call,
I like it a bunch its really fun to make videos and send them to friends and especially pictures,
Its really cute app but i think the developers needs to find more features on this app. Thank you. ‚ô•,
Great for kids to communicate with friends but a notification mute button would be nice.,
Can not log in enter all the right info and it logs out and ask for the same info over and over was working on kids previous tablets now on new tablets it will not work,
I just uninstalled it it because it would not recognize my name & password. Not worth the trouble.,
it is good to talk to people you know.and you can take pictures and call them too and send them little stickers that you can download for free,
I hate it my friends are not friends anymore because of the app. but I love it . But I wish there were better face gagers,
Its really amazing i love using this app cuz since covid im not able to see some if my friends that much so this helos alot and the filters r AMAZING,
It's ok for my daughter but why can't I add or remove people from her group chats and why can't I changed the name on her mother's profile too her real name?,
Love the app.. would be better if I had more parental control options. otherwise it is great,
So far I've had a good experience with kids messenger. I can see all my daughters contacts and restrict messages.,
This is the worst app ever every time you try to text somebody it says that the app isn't working right now,
OMG THIS IS LITTERALLY THE BEST GAME EVER! YOU CAN DO VIDEO CHAT TEXT SEND FUNNY PHOTOS AND PLAY GAMES WHILE YOU VIDEO CHAT!!! ME AND MY FRIEND LOVE THIS BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL IS CLOSED BECAUSE OF THE CORONA VIRUS SO ME AND MY FRIEND CAN COMUNICATE!! THIS IS LITTERALLY THE BEST TEXTING APP FOR KIDS!!DOWNLOAD NOW TO SEE HOW MUCH FUN IT REALLY IS!!,
It will no longer allow anyone to log in and my kids have no acess to thier friends. This is insane.,
I want you to try this out as a replacement for the Facebook messenger app because it's becoming a spacehog and sadly this app said I was too old to use it.,
It's good to see friends on it and not to glichy:) I like all the gifs and emoji on the calls.,
This app is so complicated. I have been trying to set up an account for over an hour now. Fingers crossed I will figure it out.,
I love this app and I love being able to see my friend even though we're unable to see each other right now üíó we love being able to talk and have fun,
It was easy for my kids to learn how to use it. And I can see everything they are doing and the good thing is they can't just add any one. Only I can..,
I love using the app but... It sometimes glitches out of no where and ends the call!!! Plz fix this it's my FAVOURITE App!,
This app is a great app especially in regards to monitoring a minor without it being super obvious!,
"Is good for kids, you can control who speaks to them and you can see who sends what to them. Pretty cool app.",
I can talk to my friends from far away and i dont have to say it at school. If you have a child with friends get this app for them.,
had to delete the app because there was no way to stop my phone from ringing every single time my son got a call.,
It's good but after I text someone it won't let me text again if I want to I have to uninstall it and then install it again,
I like it but not at the same time because kids can't put a profile pic on the profile from gallery likey cousin can but I can't cause I have an Android üò≠,
I like the app just I when I type stuff to sis and she not on the app somebody Is randomly replying to my texts and its creeping me out alot and somebody liked hacked in too her account and I really scared so pls fix that,
Great for when you have kids and they want to text there friends,
"it sometimes gets very laggy and on my computer its hard to do it if its laggy, but over all kids messanger is great",
The best app,
I like talking to my friends,
Why can't I download this on Android why isn't this working I'm trying to have this to be able to play with my friends and be able to like chat with them this doesn't work for Android so don't try it,
You should definitely check out this app it's really easy and you can text your friends on it ü¶à,
I like it cuz it has games and stuff and the pictures so I can take pictures and the most part the messaging cuz it's got kids messenger get it messaging yeah,
this app is really fun because you can text all of your friends and get to call them that is why that's why I gave it a five-star this app is the best app ever,
I like the app but with the new update when your on a call you can't go to the chat.,
"Jd enjoys seeing his cousins and watches the messages over and over. He does need help bringing up the messages but I dont mind, I just forget sometimes",
"Stuck in the login loop, it will not go thru after authorizing by parent, seems everyone is having this issue. Just check other reviews",
It wont let me update,
Not good apps,
Up until a week ago gave it 5 stars but now it's not seeing my internet connection so I can do absolutely nothing with it!! It's God awful because nothing corrects this!,
Nothing happens when you raport,
SOOOOOOOOOOOO FREAKING FUNNNNN!!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüíìüíìüíì,
This is great app to talk with your friends and family to can play games and more! Great app,
love the app so the kids can all contact each other but it's alil hard to navigate and add people for them,
Yes it is very good but I think you should make it so you have more choices in games and with ur pet,
"App refuses to open for my kiddo every time she opens it, it'shut down instantlythen restart and cycles of on off on etc",
"I literally can't log in, everytime I open the app it starts with next and create login, how do I just login",
It always goes to sleep and I still use it because it's the only facetime that will work but it works very poorly,
I LOVE this app!! My daughter calls and texts her friends all the time!,
THIS IS A GREAT APP!! I love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I can monitor my child on it so like if they say something they are not allowed to.,
It's a good app for your kids to talk to their friends and it is lot of fun my kid loves it,
Would be better if not huge storage demands. And won't let me move to my nice large SD card.,
It's great! I love that you can video call and message people. I love this app so much!,
Not bad to me is ok what a good app for kids..Although they need to be more space and trust even more conversation time...,
Love the app you can play games while calling and it's so much fun you can even text I love this definitely try it outüòò,
Can't accept the request from other parents or their friends.. so basically they have nobody to talk to on the dumb app,
I adore this app. Let's me communicate with my son more than usual. I hope they add gifs suitable for children though.,
It's a good app. Would be nice though for parents to able to delete conversations,
Great app but it doesn't send notifications for if someone is talking to you.,
(This is a rate from a kid)this is a great app l'm just a 7 years old girl this keeps me connected with my family and friends. GET THE APP!,
"We love the kids messenger, it's a great source for our daughter to talk with her grandparents and friends. Messenger also gives me updates to whom she is talking too.",
it kept forceclosin and saying it doesnt work. i uninstalled and reinstalled just for it to do the same thing,
i really like this app because I can talk to my friends parents and family also i can talk to multiple people at once about stuff,
I think it is awsome. It is a great exsperince for when my kids grow up!,
This is an amazing app its so easy to set up and i can text all my friends bc not all my friends have whatsapp,
It is very fun for kids we can do so many things and put sticker and play while taking,
Cannot authorize device. It keeps kicking me back to the starting page!,
It is so fun because you can text your friends and call them i rate it 5/5 i love it.üòç,
Very helpful and I felt fully in control with the people that my child is adding to her contacts...,
We are having the same issues as others an unable to log in so unable to use it such a shame as was a good app,
I love the color themes and the sounds messenger makes and the built in games and photo camera is fun. Will be excited to know what more features kids messenger will have in future updates,
This was a great app. My daughter is now having issues like everyone else. Please fix this.,
"It's wonderful, download now, great for children. FaceTime are amazing. #loveit",
"Perfect,fun and safe for kids i love it and group chatting everything i recomend this to little kids and older kids this app is awsome~üòâ",
Some times they don't get the text that you send this app needs to be way better or somebody else needs to update it,
This app is awesome such a safe and easy way for my children to communicate with family and friends,
it is awesome and when you are a kid. because parents can see everything you text,
I love it but sometimes my messages don't go through and that gets me mad so if they could fix that would be great,
Not able to add friends or family even though they are friends on my account.,
Video calling does not work every time we try to video call the screen goes black,
I totally loved your app it keeps me in touch with my son's activity online with his friends yes I know it's a bit Snoopy and I might be being a little nosy but isn't that better than not knowing what your kids doing which way did you Google Messenger kids by Facebook whomever,
This is good when you cant see your friend in real life but with this app you can message and video call,
Good app for kids. I can control who she is able too talk to from my facebook account. Easy to use.,
"It a really great app and you can let's your kid call and text people with creating them there own Facebook account, also they you don't have to worry about predator's.",
App will not allow a parent to authenticate an account so the app is broken and useless until they update it with a fix. ü§¨,
It's a great app I can talk to anyone who I want to talk with and there isn't a bad thing in this app it's great and you can make anything else it's so FUN and thank you for making this great appüòä,
Very easy to talk with my friends! Thank you for making this app so I can rp with my friends and call them when it's the weekend! -Supporter,
I feel like Messenger Kids is a great app for kids to safely stay in touch with family and friends.,
I LOVE this app heaps it's so easy to message my friends ! ‚ù§Ô∏è,
"Great app works great for my kid he can text, video call, and play games with his frends and family.",
I love it cause you can text people that your parents add,
IT is safe and a good learning tool for spelling and connection with friends you can approve of,
i love it .it is easy and fun you can video chat and take funny pictures and videos it's amazing.,
Requires the use of a Facebook account for authentication. Immediate non-starter. :-\,
"Great , I can video call my kids when I'm at work, but please fix current login/ authorization glitch!!!!",
I love this app it's let me talk to people on the other side of this globe that I have not seen in so long so I recommend this app if you want to talk to friends and family,
Overall Good. My one complaint is that my son has started to get a lot of ads and I don't know why this started or how to get rid of it.,
It's so funny that I wish that I you know like I love those funny pictures they're so funny and I like it's because you can call people they're bigger than you you can call your friends you can even send question there so fund application so I rated 5,
this app is a very usefull app Its just I wish that im on a compurture so can you try to put this on a computer size screen,
Overall it was great there were some small bugs but that didn't effect the game,
"Great, Safe, Secure.. Wish they had more games like basketball so I could play with my kiddo..",
"its nice but whenever u try to log in it always says login failure pls try again, its so god damn annoying! pls fix this",
I love this app easy to talk to the fam and friends.,
Why in gods name does all of these kids text /video apps have issues. This one has issues for the parent logging into FB. says service unavailable at this time.,
"Great job on the app. I'm able to talk to my friends and family when they are not with me. Great job, I recommend this app to anybody.",
I think that this is an awesome app i think what they fix is that they should still let you still call when when their is no wifi what if theirs an emergency and you have to call yoiur parents,
I really love it! I use it a lot But i wouldnt say 5 star just because Its pretty laggy when i call my best friends.,
I've tried to delete people from this and cannot. Need better settings. I'm over it and deleting app,
I give it five stars cuz my kids use it all the time and on their phones and it's so great for when they want to play Roblox and play whatever they want talk instead of them going mommy I want to call cousin I just have this app on their phones,
Not letting us get past the log in page and logging out when switching accounts.,
All of a sudden the camera functions don't work within chats...no pics can be taken and can't video call,
Great App to monitor who your young children speak to. Very safe and well monitored.,
Friends do you want you want you can talk to the friend whoever you want to talk to friends and feel got their thing bottom I love this app so much and Royal Pat I love that more than anything I think this is a 5-star rating I don't think any lower but I may be sending a lot more Texas. And I mean a lot Richard man alive so be readyüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ,
it's a really good app. if I am correct you don't have to use wifi which is good!!!,
I like I can see the photos exchanged but its both so easy to add friends if you don't know the parents,
What a fun app to keep the entire family entertained! Even grandma cracked up and had a good laugh!,
My daughter loves this app enjoys chatting with her friends. And I love it because I can see what they're talking about. This is great for young children.,
This app is great! I have been using it for 5 months now and I don't have anything bad to say except it is sometimes laggy,
I just got the app today and I was using it for a bit and it is not letting me send messeges to my friend plz fix this bug,
It seems like a safe place for kids and it's parental verification looks great. My problem is that my grandson wants to message me and the app wants me to create a kids messenger account for myself in order for him to contact me when I already have a fb msg account,
"I love it use it everyday . Perfect if you want to talk to your friends family anything you want to do, but there is rules which I am fine with that.",
"It's a good app for kids so that they can experience texting, calling, and video chat.",
something is happening and I don't know what but everytjme I'm in the app it either zooms in or blurs out but overall the app is good to call my friends,
Great game! No ads! Wonderful way to talk to friends during this time for me!,
Doesnt give notifications Edit: it now doesnt send messages properly I have to uninstall and reinstall the app,
"love this,,, now my boy don't open my messages an I don't know so I never respond..... also maybe one day I wouldn't want him to see something in my messages! so this is perfect to have his own kid friendly messager",
"Great and very secure for kids. As a parent, I can monitor everything they do",
"I would love to give a review, I would love to talk to my grandchildren but google keeps stopping, just randomly keeps stopping",
Good overall to contact my neices and nephews. But I don't get notifications that I have messages for weeks,
I can't create an account it says 'something went wrong try again later' It's not letting me sign up fix this!! üò†,
it is amazing i would deffinitly downlowed it my kids love it!!,
It's very good üòä,
Love talking to my friends. Super friendly and controlled. Lots of fun,
I'm having the same issue. I cannot log in despite repeated attempts. I hope this could be fixed soon.,
I love this thing I can talk to my friends and it's really fun you can even send them videos I never knew that!!!! :-),
My kids like this app. They mostly use it to talk to grandparents and cousins that live far away. I like that I can see and control who they talk to.,
"Won't let me sign in, just kicks my back to the original screen when I attempt to authorize.",
I can't send photos from different apps even if it's just me or someone I know,
Everything I try to create a account it declines. I even tried with my other account and it doesn't work. I WANT YOU TO FIX THIS üò° üò° üò°,
I hope parents can delete the conversation,
I love the app while it worked but I just got my own phone and I can't contact any of my friends that don't have a phone number,
Incoming calls don't ring or pop up anywhere only get notifications of missed calls.,
I love it for my daughter so then I can see what her and her friends are talking about so they're not up to anything bad and so she can connect with her friends.,
"it was really easy for me to set it up for my 10 yr old, i can video call him anytime.",
You can chat with friends and play games you can even make groups so I love the app it's floured and perfect,
I think it is a great app and a great way to chat with friends and family and the mini games are awesome,
i liked it its just my phone broke and im waiting for a new one so i tryed getting it for my computer and it would not let me i tryed and tryed and trye and tryed but it will not work help,
"OMG this is like the best app ever for my kid. it is very secured and controled by parents, if your child feels uncomfterble they can report it on messenger kids but for the most of all messenger kids is the best meseging app for kids ever... Other kid messeging apps get hacked all the time so dont install those apps. Messenger kids is tye best choiceüëç",
Can't even open app. Keeps flashing black then to opening screen.Less then 1star no possible.,
it is a very good app for kids who want to talk to their friends and family and I love the app from Harper stewart,
You can't change the color anymore and its just isn't like it use to be which it use to be nore usable and fun,
No idea how to make this work. Tried adding my son's friend. They tried adding us. Mayhem. Eventually just used normal messenger. I'm probably doing something wrong.,
I love this but I don't see the update,
you can text your friends and your mom and you can do anything it even has games so yeah I can call my friends and my my grandparents too so I love it and my all my cousins and stuff I love it it's so fun cuz has games it has all these different apps you can call from kids messenger so thank you kids messenger and creating this I love this app and I just want to do it everyday,
I m glad now we have a chat app for kids. As a parent I have all the control and I am.using this for my child to talk to his grandparents and friends. We needed something like this.,
Nice its perfect but whenever my kids send a link it allways says cant sent btw can you make there own stickers?,
I don't like the app or use it on my device. I don't like seeing it on Facebook or any other locations!!!,
This app is really good cuz during this pandemic you all know we miss our friends so this app makes it so we can camunicat with our friends with finding each other with for words üíïby the way my name is MILEE I'm ten and I'm on my mom's account ‚ò∫,
i love this app I set it up for my daughter and told all her friends paremts from her kindergarten class and they got their kids set up and now all they do is call amd message each other its cute........however i would give it 5 stars but Facebook we need more masks amd stickers amd such for the video chat so they can have some of the same ones us adults have my daughter is very upset she doesnt have the one with the kitties that float around and I do. please help with this!!!,
"When I want to add another child it ALWAYS keeps saying ""account creation faliure"" EVERYTIME I try to do it.",
Its a good app its just annpying when the message says faild to send.Ive tried everything i can to stop that.,
I thought it was great I wanted to FaceTime my friend so we both got this app and we use it all the time,
When I video call my friends I can hear them but their screen is fully black it is very annoying can you guys pleas make a update on this,
I really like the app. Except that you can't unsend messages or photos,
I keep on trying to make an account for my child but it says account creation failure try again I have tried about 30 times but it still is not working.,
I love this app my kids can text thare family and friends it is rily organized and help them learn.,
The games when you want to play they don't play and also the emojis on camera they stopped working so that is why I vote for 2 stars,
App will not install on my phone. But did on my tablet. Tried restarting etc nothing worked,
good app but it needs a do not disturb function as the messages coming in distract my child when hes supposed to be doing work,
"It's fun but glitches and says ""messange can not be sent "" to one person but works the other it's not fair üò° this is garbage fix or I will delete üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°",
Love the app but parents need to be able to delete individual messages in a conversation.,
Fun sometimes slow though I recommend it to any child to connect with friends.,
I am having problems with login I log in and then I have to authorize login and I do that and then it takes me right back to login it keeps on going back and forth over and over and not letting me log in,
Can only see myself and not the other person on video chat. And their camera is on not off. Please help!,
It is a great app I love it But Facebook miss a very important feature The voice call Why you only put a video call Just add a voice call plzüòâüòâ,
I'm so happy to be able to be more in control of what my kids are doing on their phones but still able to let them talk to their friends. thank you for providing a safe way to let children communicate,
"Well....Adults can be on this app, I'm a kid and I was talking to a adult. It was confusing.",
Seriously? You need to use FACEBOOK to be able to freaking even use the app?! This is unacceptable! Just because STUPID FACEBOOK Made this app doesn't mean they can assume everyone has FACEBOOK! Just use a parent's phone number! Seriously.,
"Can't log in to other device, my son has new device and i neede to transfer his account to his new device ut it won't go thru. I logged in too mamy times still going back to log in",
"I cannot seem to log in my daughter's account, tried several times but i just keep on landing in sign in page :(",
i love the app it's a great way to conect with your kid and them to have conacts with friends and super safe love it,
This is a great app to communicate with friends and parents but you have to have a Facebook account when you're a parent or it won't work,
It is such a good app! You need to get it!!!! And your kid well have so much fun using it. Its safe and you can read thire teaxs! You have to get it!!,
It's great if the kids make it home before you . And they can stay on the phone till you make it if you're running late.,
It is a really good way to communicate but a call app lets you call people all around the world,
Sometimes you can't hear people but great program and cool games keep up the good work,
"Just glad to allow my daughter to experience the Facebook experience, without unwanted contact . thank you",
This is such a good app! I can contact my parents all the time and they can too! It works out great for everyone!,
"It's a great way to keep in touch with your family members, and you can turn on and off the notifications for individual people.",
Pretty perfect for kids to be able to text their friends and family!,
Great app. Parents have full control but cannot delete the messages which is a pain....,
It's a good way for kids to talk and socialize online. My kids use the app daily and they love it.,
My daughter loves this app and I love that she can only talk to people who I choose!,
it is amazing for your kids u can have mesager and check stuff and it is fun for your kids to enjoy,
"Nice... just that it is not really necessary to log in from Facebook.. but everything else is fantastic, adorable, superb and yes awesome üëå üòé üëè üòä üôå üòÄ üëå üòé üëè üòä......",
Great for my children to talk to their friends. It also blocks language.,
Fun and easy to use. Safe too! My kids love talking with their family from far away!,
"It's good but I cant put a picture from my camera roll as my profile picture , so if you could please fix that",
"She likes sending goofy pictures of herself, safely, to the people on her friends list.",
"The app no longer works. There's nothing more to it, you just can't even log in.",
"Love it! My kids use it to talk to their friends, since the pandemic has made it hard to see them.",
"If I could give no stars at all. I would, trying to login in and still not working.... FIX IT!!!!!",
it is a good app but it dosient conect to the wifi or internet verry well,
"i love messenger kids to call someone or chat with friends because it's fun and i used to edit videos and i love it don't block it,it's fun i love it.",
Easy to use child account/device to child a/d but using as the administrator device(parent phone) not as easy.,
it's ok. the worst thing I have to say is my ex husband wants to talk to his daughter but we're not friends on FB...need a way to add her dad even if we're not friends on Facebook,
messenger kids is a verry good app you can lots of friends and family the calls never glitch and I would give this a five star rating.,
This app is awesome. I don't have to worry about strangers trying to chat with my kids and watching for bullying. I love this app and got my family to get it too.,
"It is good, but when I try to change the porfile photo it put like backwards And I will like that I can use personal stickers",
I wanted to give a half star its very bad cant login in when i log in by account and search for friend it says app has stopped,
Good app need to add way to see all your groups,
"The app always would say ""Find a faceüòÅ"" In games even though ur face is right in the screen and there is major lag",
Very great app also very safe for kids to talk to friends so im rating 5 :)))),
Its good but you need to keep updating it and its fun for your kids to talk to their friends.,
Recent update ruined it... Cant send my friends links or videos even looked through the settings same as my friend Please fix this,
It's an azing app but it's not updating for me if the developer can make it update that it would be 5 stars but only 4 for now,
Downloaded this so my daughter can message her dad while he's on the road. It just keeps looping back to login when I've done it.,
So I was trying to get on messenger kids but it would not let me andi tried to call would not let but my internet was fine nothing has happened to it so if you could fix this it would be great,
Calling for a password but denying me entry. Saying its wrong....I've never been on this app before...so it's not wrong.,
"I have had a good time, unlike some people. I call friends and play games at the same time which I think is cool. I like this app.",
Awsome and great,
5 but I can't find how to do effect on a voice message,
"My girl is so excited to found this app in play store. She is a newbie. We found this app last week. But, we installed today! She's happy. Thanks to the developer.",
Ok last time I tried this app was in 2019 it worked fine but now it's not sending any messages please fix this,
This app updates alot. I only give it a two because The video call wont work from time to tome,
Sometimes i dont get messages that were sent and it would hang up the call randomly,
I like that I am able to monitor my child's activity as well as select who she is able to talk to.,
Good app I use it to message friends and my mom but it hangs up by its self sometimes until Facebook has fixed it it wil a 4 star when they fix it it will ne a five star,
It takes a long time to download but is worth it. It is safe and is almost like the real messenger.,
It is just so awesome because I get to just love FaceTime with my friends and I just love him like I love how it's really good for covid-19 and it's just I love seeing my grandma and all my friends and it's just really fun,
It gliches but it is so fun there are filter and all kinds of things you can add as many friends has you want,
I wish it voice called to but otherwise this app is amazing you should get it and everytime your kids text you get notified,
I love this app! It is great because I can call my friends from school.,
So far so good. Very safe to use and the best part is it saves messages too.,
"During this pandemic i wasent able to interact with my friends, but after i installed it i could socailize more",
You can talk to all you friends and create friend groups! It is just like Messanger but for kidz!!!!,
Literally everytime i try to make a ####ing account it says go to messenger or account failure which makes it so annoying!!!!!!!,
"My child loves it, loves being able to contact me anytimeüòÑ I love it for the same reason!!",
"Messenger kids is a great app, my son uses it almost every day between calling his cousin, asking me if he can use the stove while im at work, and just trying new games.",
I love this app it is perfect!!! I thought there was Tick Tock sounds and my friend has it but I haven't got it yet,
i love it can fast time peolel but i even get to text. so fun to go on whan you are bored so u can have great time. i looooooooooove I t all my frands haves it . i might of spell some wrang as i was saying if u dont have your missing out. have a nice day,
"I would like it more but it won't update, everyone but me has a cool update and mine won't work. But other than that it's ok.",
i love the app. but can you guys make it where you dont have to have a fb account to send a request. my kids grandparents doesnt have fb but they have messenger.,
Beacuse your friends have to be friends to chat with all of them. Its a relly good app though. If your parents will not let you have messenger ask for messenger kids.,
The app is not working. It keeps declining my password. And my password is correct. How do I get help??,
This app sucks it crashes and the delay is horrible and it does not deserve a star worst app ever made!,
Great app to introduce text to a child and to have your child communicate with family safely.,
"my mom trys to send me links for my videos for the plays I'm in but after a few minutes it says ""this content is blocked"". I know it's supposed to be safe but my guardian that is my guardian on here should be able to send me links.",
Love it I'm 10 and I use this all the time but I cant find how to get a ringtone Highly recommend this it was the best thing I've ever used whenever I need to talk to my parents or my friends I always uses my I never get signal I can't get signal for my parents so I use this and this is awesome it's just I can't find how to use the ringtones so I want to get a new ringtone so please find out how do you do this,
It is nice to talk with friends but sometimes it does not go though and I can't get notifications,
Not good connection for fast calls and take long time for receiver to recieve the massage .,
Excellent platform. Works well and the safety measures are pretty great.,
Its nice and good for messagesand stuff but can be laggy and weird some time but its really fun and a nice app,
I love it because you get to chat with friends i just love the effects and the mini games and the pets,
This app sucks won't allow me to create a login looked for multiple ways to donit and it won't. Zero support whatsoever.,
So cool it perfect for people who don't have a SIM card or can't afford a phone that is connected to a network. So cool üòéüòéüòé,
love this my son feel so independent and I feel so at ease with how secure this app has made me feel thus far.,
The app is amazing it lets lets me talk to friends i had the app for 3 years and nothing has happend everything is working,
Texting doesn't work well when ever I text it randomly cuts out and ends up being gibberish,
So good I love it because if you don't have teal message you steel can talk with frindes and family and there's games and picutres i love it 5 stars,
I love the content but the downside is that you can't just Call You can only video call and message That's it yeah So facebook please Make a call on messenger kids app,
Awesome awesome but you need Facebook so it's kinda HARD and to people who it won't let them pics from there gallery thats user error maybe try again,
I love this app I can text all my friends and video call and you don't need to pay money to have it!,
Good app I like the app a lot it doesn't take long to set up I can call my friends and family it has fun games on it I say it deserves five star I really like the app,
Great app for keeping us in contact with our grandchild when we can't see them.,
it has no ads it is very safe for ur kids and u can do face time chat with ur friend it is a really good app for kids,
If I could I would give it 0 stars and if you dont have Facebook or cant get in it dosent work and If you forget your facebook account it makes you re start and it was so annoying so I wouldn't recommend this app to any one,
Will not let me login. Have tried on multiple devices and it automatically logs me out and tells me to sign in again,
"I love this app- it has goals,video calling, filter changer, voice mails,etc!",
"Great, but could use more parental controls and no dependency on FB app.",
i like this app and suggest you could add some tools for shutting off notifications during school hours for kids homeschooling during this pandemic.,
Its good. I wish you can just call them instead of FaceTime.,
I love this app I can talk with my friends and also text my family. This is the best app,
I'm having problems with creating an account. I've tried 2 facebook on 3 phones.,
"Now unable to use to speak to my child. Not showing we are connected as friends, and not letting me find other people",
I can't log in because I can't remember my Facebook password and they should give you other options on how to log in.,
Tried to set it up for my son and it just keeps saying something is wrong try again done it like 10 times and nothing,
I love this app becuase it is amazing and I can FaceTime my friends call my friends and text them and it kids messenger it is just the perfect app I love it so much!‚ò∫‚ò∫üòäüòäüòä‚ò∫‚ò∫üòäüòäü§ó‚ò∫ü§óüòäüòÅüòäüòÄüòÅüòÖüò•üôÑüòôüòö‚ò∫üôÇüòäüòãüòäüòÄüòÄüòäüòÖüòÜüòäüòäüòò,
Its great you just cant send links. I strongly reccomend this app for your kids!,
I don't have that much storage so I has to keep deleting it and my mom isn't signing me back in. so if you don't have that much storage I don't recommend getting this.,
Cant down lode photo. Didnt recognise password. After recieving temp code couldn't find place to instal it.,
"Whenever I log in with my facebook, it just goes back to the login page over and over again.",
I think they should have more pictures and more education for the kids that need it like math spelling well my son enjoys it,
I logged out and I can't log back in we tried putting in the right password and it doesn't let us plz help but otherwise I like your app,
I would like to be able to send my children videos to watch that I see appropriate and for them to be able to see photos sent to them from other approved family members. It can be approved through the person that is managing the children's account.,
Good app for kids but bad because when people might be sleeping they could text them and it wouldn't end well,
You cant send zoom meeting request links. Why is that? Teachers are having issues doing so thru this app with students plz fix!!!,
I can't download it just says install for other devices I physically can't use this app because I can't physically install it because there's no freaking button for it I'm trying to download it on pc because my mum says I'm able to but there's no download button,
"Love this app for my son, being able to control it all from my phone gives a feeling of safety and security and my son can stay in touch with friends",
Love this app. Great way for my child to keep in contact with her friends and family.,
This is a very safe and apropreit app. I love it. I talk to at least 40 people on messenger kids. -9 year old-,
Great for kids this is an awesome app It just needs a little bit more improvement.,
Maybe it will be more fun for kids to share theyre screen or watch videos with eachother but its kid safe.,
"I am having the WORST experience trying to set this up for my daughter. Trying my best to give her options during quarantine, but Messenger Kids won't let me confirm my FB account because it's set up with my cell number instead of an email. Can't figure out any way to get someone to HELP ME PLEASE!!!",
I like you that you get family and talk to them often. But it doesn't install correct that's really hard and frustrating to do that because I am a kid and my typing all of this but I feel like I should try harder I'm only 7 but almost 8 because my birthday is in April and it is March,
"i would give it -10 if i could. cant get it to open messages sent to me! so frustrated, as are my grandchildren.",
it is very usefull these days because we dont see that much people and this helps me stay in touch with all my family and freinds i think everyone should downaod this app,
Messenger kids is a good game because then you could just be calling your family and when you miss them you can call them mad at you always seem to your family and I hope my mom gets this because I love it so much just you can call your family and you and you don't have to and you could text you during me and then wake up and you nice things and no cussing in it because that would be bad,
"Uninstalled and reinstalled twice, the darn stupid app still won't work. It's useless.",
Can't get the app to install on any device I use.,
"Love this app for monitoring my tween, we do wish the filters were the same as Facebook Messenger as well as gif features.",
I love this app it lets me connect to all my best friends but it sometimes doesnt let me text.,
Very good if yoy want to talk to your friends and add anyone whenever you can block people and name groups‚òÜ‚ô°‚òÜ‚ô°,
"its a really good app, With the filters and stickers and emojis you can put in!",
I was going to add a new profile pic and then i saw sitch account and i pressed it and i got sined out of my account so i still have my account i just cant text so i also tired my moms Facebook account password and it said did not work i mean how stupid are you to add that on a kids app kids are curious so yeah and its relly difficult with this new version of the app its even harder than messenger and also i think this is a harder to use messenger now so thats just not cool so you better fix it,
My daughter loves it.. She can to all of her friends and be able to message me whenever she wants,
It's the best. I didn't have a texting apps. So when my mom saw it I was like üò≥‚ù§Ô∏è. So I really rackned this appüòÑüòÅüòç,
This is a great way for younger kids to keep in contact without using a phone..,
"If you let us pick a picture from the gallery,either than that its awesome!",
I thought with proper guidance and understanding of the technical limitations this is a very good way for parents to encourage kids to stay in touch with friends and relatives.,
Love this app good way to keep in touch with your child and they can talk to their little friends under your watch,
"Can't ""remove"" a friend I accidentally clicked. Parent account vs kids account is confusing. I should also be able to log into the account from my device and have a live view of the kids conversation.",
The app is good but theres a beep noice when i call then it hangs up the call! Please fix it!,
"I love it but... you can,t delete messages üò± And some times you need To! But everything else... GREAT!",
i like this app a lot it is good and i can text and call my friends and family members üòä so thanks for giving this app i find it usefull now and may be interested n the future.,
"This app is very nice for me as a parent because i can track my childs activities on the phone however it saddens me to know that this is not applicable in the Philippines. I am an overseas worker and im based here in dubai,uae while my son is in the Philippines. I hope this can be useful to any countries around the world. Anyway, God speed.",
It's great for kids and allows your kids friends and family super easy to use,
I love this app alot but I wish you could do it off internet and I get to talk to all of my friends even if they're not on messenger kids but just on messenger!,
"Nice idea,but need more interacting face changing options like regular fb messenger offers.",
"I have my grandkids on here, and I LOVE IT!!! I get to hear their voices, and talk to them ALOT more than ever before, and I feel SO much CLOSER to them!!!",
my daughter loves being able to talk to her buddy's and family and i love how safe it is and that they can't delete the conversations,
"nice app, all though when I click on any of the games, including raise your pet, I can't play them cause they won't load",
"Stuck in the endless ""authorize device"" loop. Makes the app unusable.",
I can chat with my friends and it's amazing I used this app almost every day I would rate this about a 10 out of 10!,
I love messenger kids it never gliches and its a free way to text your friends and family! If i were you I would download it as soon as I could!‚ò∫‚ò∫üòçüòç,
I love it because I can have my kid talk with there friends while there having fun.,
It is great for kids to call and doesn't let them use the rude finger or any inapropriet emojis and i reccomend you try it out,
This is an amazing app I love the games on the app to and the group chats and also that you can do gif too.,
i love that you can text people on Messenger kids when you have no service.But i hate that sumtimes you can't see the pictures so you can't text themüòî.,
"We've been trying to authorise our tablet with the Messenger Kids app for a few days, but each time my wife tries to use her FB account info to validate, it just takes her back to ""Find your account"". This is also happening on my Samsung phone. What do we have to do to escape this loop from hell???",
I have used this and it's very good for chlidern,
Rhis is great because i can choose with my facebook acounnt who my kids can text and facetime and it just some fun games you can do over the phone,
"It is really fun, I can talk to my friends all day! And i can talk to my cousins that live far away! I rate this a 5 because it is really fun and i can talk to anyone",
It is easy to chat with friends.but sometimes it gliches .and it hung up on me and my friend and we didnt hite the hang up bution.,
"This app is awesome it allows kids to text,call,FaceTime,and voice text each other.",
One problem sometimes it doesn't let me text my friends it says unable to send but my wifi is perfectly fine,
"My daughter would like more games than just ""Healthy Habits"" and our Pet is maxed out too.",
Downloaded the app. Get notifications that I have messages but can't get the messages,
I love this app üòç it's so great and my kids can chat with there friend and family it's really good for the current situation with the hole corana virus,
Its telling me to update after i updated and now i cant do anything. It takes me to google play website then app its really frustrating,
I love it and it doesn't have any ads.you can call your friends and chat and your parents can have most control or you can chat with parents through Facebook.,
This app is very good because as you should know it is literally messenger for kids. My kids love chatting to one another.,
I can't take a profile picture because it said no internet but I have great internet. but its fine.But the problum might just be mine its fine app so you should try it,
I love it because it is a way for family and friends to communicate it is also kid appropriate,
This is a great app but I think the kids should have stories so that their friends can see what they are up to.,
Great for the kids. Safe and easy. I use it when my teenager is babysitting,
"Its preeeeeeeeeaty good. I can talk to my mom alot and my family, but Messenger the original had a bit more features",
I love this app but i wish it lets you do things on other devices you can do and you cannot voice call,
Messenger Kids is a fun and safe app for your kids to talk to family and friends! I would recomend it to anyone who is looking for an app like Messenger Kids! LOVE THIS APP!!!,
A little tricky to use but it allows my son to have fun texting me. :),
I like the app but this one particular thing that I would like you to have it faster the pet aging,
Ive bewn using this for a while it works pretty well its a bit glitchy and laggy but overall pretty okay app i would recommend,
Yeah I am in love with this app BUT the problem is that my freind is in another country and when ever I get back my app is asleep so I never get to chat with herüò≠üò≠so can you please fix itüòâ,
"Fantastic app, that gives my Grandkids the freedom to video call, send me pictures, & all kinds of fun!!!",
This app is pretty decent but it keeps not sending my messages and it keeps doing it I think it needs a update,
Its a good app works since the corona came but it works.I reccomend this app to parents an children because you can talk to your friends or family.have a good day everybody and stay safe,
didnt like it as much cause you cant even text people when there not active and you need to be under wifi,
"Well,the video calling is glitchy and hangs up randomly but overall it's a good app.",
I Love The App. My Son Can Talk To Me Or His Other Mom When We Are Not Around . It's A Great Way For Us To Communicate With Him When We Are Away üòâ,
I luv it it is the best game because it lets me face time voice messege and text my friends and family.,

It's super fun you can video chat other people and other things. I love the app!üëçüòÅ,
A very good app for kids and there is a lot of cool effects games and emojis so I rate this a 10/10,
This app seems good. But soon as I get to the last part they say something went wong. I keep doing it over but it do the same thing. So I suggest you shouldn't get this app.,

"I love this App I use it to text my family, also bring back my BT21 stickers! please.",
It does not allow me to create an account for my child üòí it keeps saying there was a problem to try again and 3 days later it still says the same üôÑ,
I love üíï this app. Initially it was difficult to download it. Buh now I enjoying it. It's the best social media for Kids,
Difficult getting in touch with Greatgranddaughter. For a senior citizen it is a bit confusing,
I think this app is really good you can chat to your friends and family and there is rules but the rules are meant to give you safety instructions. And that is why I like this app... ITS WONDERFUL ‚ù§Ô∏è,
I added a second child in FB but it doesn't show up when I try to switch accounts,
This app is good in all but it cannot send videos it can only send photos please fix this,
This app is good and when you want you can voice meseg and face time and text so good,
"It's perfect, you can play games in video call and much more cool effects",
Needs more customization options. My six your old son really needs more to Express himself much like we adults do.,
Great app my kids are able to connect with there cousins there age thru here and get to know eachother because they live in different cities and states,
Tried multiple times. Keep getting acct creation failure msg even though i tried using different devices,
"I had just finished my login after making TWO new Facebook accounts, and it says that the login failed. All I want to do is talk with my friends, is that too much to ask for?",
Works good but the thing is somwtimes we go out and it doesnt work without wifi.,
I don't like this ad very much cuz it won't let me updated it makes me want to delete my game I still like it cuz I can't talk with my family,
"I checked my tablet this morning and click on messager kids, if said app not installed. Either my tablet sucks or the app just uninstalled itself",
Technical not a child but only way to use it was to make an account.Messanger you should have someone combined the two or a little icon on the original messanger just got it so that just my opinion,
Love it so my Grandson can talk too other kid's just for more friend's From different part's of the world but Not ime alone From Home or Spending night's Unless Your Parent's Very good Friend's with Their Parent's!!! I thank Technology!!See Ya!#üêüüí¶‚ù§üåà,
Great app I highly recommended it. It is awesome and I use it all the time it has funny photos and it's the best app ever!!,
Very nice for the children to be able to communicate especially during this lockdown situation.,
Hi it's me again I have messenger kids as my app too and it is amazing I'm the one who said that groovy pad you know that thing that I just talked about well that happens amazing but this app is amazing you want to know why because what you do is you go ahead and have to miss out and what you do if one of your cousin friends people whoever you want neighbors anybody if they have messenger kids all you do is just type in their code and there you have it you guys get to go into play games when y c,
I was trying to ge this app for my child and it asked for my facebook account and I don't have one so I could not get this app for my child very bad appüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüèºüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéI would absaloutly would love it if you fixed this,
I really like that there are so many safety features. If you could read the kids' messages from your messenger app it would be a 5 star review.,
When I download the app on my daughters iphone 6 and I put my password in it pops up and says u cannot use this feature at this time as we limit posts and etc is it because my phone is Android and hers is iphone,
"My 7 yr old neice is my sole reason for having this app. She is extremely tech savvy for being just 7. She's got me beat, lol. Fun emojis and video options",
Doesn't work on 2x kids tablets 2xlaptops or pc. I dont unlock my phone for the kids. And constant reminders to download are a pain in the butt! Not impressed,
I really like this app but the only problem is that when I am trying to put a photo from gallery it won't let me,
My kids always stop being able to get notifications or calls unless I uninstall and reinstall every few days,
Easy to set up and provides great features to keep my child safe.,
its always crashing not able to log into it for long periods of time hate this app,
This us a really asome app live ut can talk to my family or friends but the only thing I wish I had is it could be used on no wifi.,
Great app for your kids to safely stay in contact with friends and family!,
"I love this because when I didn't have a phone number, I could still talk to my friends. Get this for kids who want to talk to friends!",
I love having kids mesenger it is the only way that I can text bc I am not old enogh to text yet.,
this is great for chatting with family members who are not there at the time. and for friends. (sorta) 10/10,
I love this app but there's a small problem it like disconnctes when you are on the phone and get on a nother app but this app is kid friendly,
Not being able to sign in.....says there's an error. Then says can't find account which is BS,
It's a very glad thing for kids like my kids love it so they asked me if I can rate it with five stars and I said of course girls,
I love It! it is so fun! I can face time and text my friends!,
Only issue I have is when the messages won't send even after the sleep mode times have been changed,
It's awesome! I can text all my friends and family with no problem. Just make sure you have internet connection,
"It would not load to try calls. Just kept blinking off and on, won't load üò•",
This is such a good game so meny friends you can add wen a virus is happening you can video chat that person I love this app.,
I love it so much but sometimes it doesn't let me send messages and it's so annoying,
a nice app that allows your kids to talk to ther friend and family only friend can add your kid:'),
Amazing I can see what my daughter does and if there is anything inappropriate It will send a message to my Facebook account!üëç,
It's like really good when I wanna call my cousins and stuff and ya. Also something I need to tell every one go to utube and subscribe to Sssniperwolf she great,
It is a really good app for kids because they can't just add random numbers.,
"Great, safe way to stay connected to your young one when you are apart.",
I love this app you can face time and there is activity when you are bored also you can chat with friends you just need there code,
Really sucky and bad üëé but they can text there friends but you have to have internet to do anything on it,
messenger kids is a great way for kids to connect to there friends alot easier than having to be with eachother 24/7,
Fun for the kids especially when they are stuck at home and miss their friends!,
Never let's me log in the app it says my password is incorrect but it isn't so I deleted the app. Wish I could give you 0 stars,
"I have set up the account for one child and it's working great, however, it doesn't seem possible to add another child! Why??? Can you please fix this?!",
I think it will be amazing to text other friends and everything I can't wait to try( please get this app),
Its great for calling friends if u dont have their number also very laggy It never works when I need it to,
It doesn't let me log into it and I tried it with my moms face book account password and it didn't work.,
It is good but data is only 2gigabytes and no I don't have any kids to be friends on this,
I üíñ that I can chat with my grandkids with all this Corona it makes it much easier and they feel important getting personal messages. Thank You,
I love it so much i can text and call and share stuff with my family or friends!,
"Super, I love app there are mini games, you can decor your app I love this nothing bad to say",
I love it! I can chat with my friends when ever i would like! Its absolutely awesome,
So far so good. Very good innovation for safe communication with our kids,
Its great ! I really like it its easy to call and text on!,
It's great my 3 year old can call me anytime when I'm at work and it's easy for him to use,
A life saver for quarentine. My son can video chat with his friends easily and safely..,
i had my kid delete this app cause she kept getting hold of random peoples phone number because they would make a post then they would tell everybody there phone number only let your kids get this app under great supervision and dont let your kid get into what my kid expeirienced.,
I absolutely love messenger kids because I can call my friends when I bored and friends that I don't see often!! Only thing is.. Mom made the time 8:00 am to 8:00 pm soo when on a call it shuts off. But that's all cool üòé,
awesome this is app is a good way for kids to communicate with people who are not strangers.,
Needs something more than just text can u add like characters kids can build and change so it can be a bit more fun?!,
I like it so far only day 2 with it. But i wish i could read all the messages. Then ot would be 5 stars,
"It was a good app to call friends on, but every time you had log in to facebook to use the app",
"my kids love it and I love I can control who contacts them, much easier to avoid the creeps",
"I love it cuz then i could facetime my friends, chat to them, and......Yeah!",
It does not work it never does my douter keeps requesting her friend but i l cant figure out how to allow her to text her friend,
Is a really good app for me and my friends to talk on and if something happens you mom or dad can see and you can talk with them on it please try,
I can talk and stay in touch but my parents can still watch me. The filter are so funny! I LOVE THIS GAME!,
"I hate that after I started responding to my grandsons request & found out that I didn't need the app,Google wouldn't let me cancel it AND kept HOUNDING me with messages to finish...Sorry kids, I am happy that YOU like it",
I love this app so much because I have loads of cousins other places so this app helps me come together from other places I usually talk to my mom and dad,
I love this app it is the best the worst is that when you add somewone and that was the wrong one and tou block rhem then you still see how you blocked,
It's so easy now for me to text my friend and send pictures with so many different filters,
Very Perfect all you need is a Facebook account login then I'm able To contact my family and friends within a safe route :^),
"Best app ever! It was a little sketchy because it asked for my dads facebook at first, but iys amazing! Five stars for sure! üòÅ",
I think it's so cool cuz it's just you can call text almost everyone you can do on it it is so cool,
2 stars now only because i can't conect with my own kiddo.. I'm her parent but y'all are not letting me be logged on so her and i can chat.. Ready to delete and find another appt that works..,
it is very cool. i get to text my loved one all the time!!!,
i can no longer message and send texts and video chat does not notify also it says that no internet connection when IM IN MY HOUSE!,
A great way for my child to stay in touch with family and friends with everything going on right now. Even my 84 year old mother can use it to talk to her granddaughter.,
Love it so much you can do so many funny thing but one thing can you make it where we do not need conection for it,
"Difficult for grandmas to learn to function. For example, I'm pretty sure I downloadd the app, but my grandchild keeps telling me to download it. Huh?",
I love the app but I wish you could add filters daily including a turtle filter!,
I love this app it is so fun. i can talk to my friend and famliy and play some games but some times it says update app,
"It's a really good app, I get to talk to my long distance cousins on it wich is nice!",
"Awesome!!! I use it to call, text my mom and other siblings! It's so useful!!",
Account creation failed i tried many times to log in but they continue shows that account creation failed,
"Well this app is great! I read violet bean da stranger's comment and violet, this is not a game but a app, the downside is that the comments reveal this is mobile device only. so just download for the best! kids over 6 and under 10 like me are gonna love this app!",
Best app for kids to talk to each other. Super secure! A+,
"I love it. No adds, although sometimes it's a little glitchy. But I still love it!",
i love that i can chat with my son and be able to watch who else he is talking too. also that i can set it to sleep at any days and times i choose.,
Does not always work can't sent messages all the time to one person but I can still send to group chats,
This is such a great app i love talking to my friends and famliy so when i moved i could stay in contact,
Not entirely sure it's a horrible game but I couldn't log in because you had to have facebook,
Great app for children to talk to there freinds and also my friend moved away so i have only this to talk to her,
"Does not let sign in says invalid account would not reccomend, i reset my password 4 times and still did not work.",
It's a very good app but when you don't go on it for awile it resets everything.,
Great app my child loves it and I love to see her happy talking to her friends and family on the app,
"I love it, it has no ads and it's for kids, teens, and adults. I'd say it's perfect.",
Really good app i can call and text my friends that can't do it on regular text and call,
My kids love being able to keep in contact with their friends and family. I love being snorer to choose who they get to contact,
I like this game because if your kid this is really fun for you to chat your friends also we need it right now it's because the coronavirus,
This app is really hard to set up for my kids. It wont let me connect to their accounts,
So far it's been really a great app for myself when trying to teach my 9 year old,
this is a good app to use because you can video chat and have control what friends they add on it,
Does not work. Continues to display error message when attempting to create an account.,
it's fun and it works really good but you need internet and that's my only complaint but either way it's good,
I really like this app beacause if your parents wont let you normally call on your phone this is a great app for calling and talking wi th fam and friend's,
love that I have the control over the app and my 6 yr old can still communicate with me and her family and closest friends.,
Soooo much fun no ads but it only does video chat but very good for kids like it should be for 1+,
This is great for your kids to text other kids and let them txt family and friends.,
This is very good because I can text my friends because I'm 8 and I can talk with my parents which my dad never answers but that's okay because he is a very very good dad,
I accidentally created multiple accounts for my daughter and I can't delete the extras.,
Best texting app ever!!! Please donload for you or your child! So great!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,
"Ever since thr last update, it keeps crashing. please fix!",
I love this app my kids can talk to there friends but there should be a kids Facebook for them to.,
It's amazing üòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è I love this because I get to talk to all my friends and my family and my mom loves it too except for when l make really big video chats,
awesome but i cant text my friends when on a call with an other person hope you find this review helpfull,
love it helps you keep in touch with friends family and more i really would suggest this app get it really like get it,
AWSOME now I can chat with my friends even in corantein. This app is so good you can have sleepovers on the video omg it is AWESOME,
i love this app my freand showed it to me and now i have alot of my freands on it and i can even play video games with my freands throu calls ive already down loaded in on my phone now im down loading it in my laptop,
Great grandma and just agreed to add family not sure how works. But if supposed to make safer for kids all for it.,
Good I can text lots of people all though it is proably not as safe as you think!,
Its good app but the reason i made 4 stars is that no share screen please add that it will make it more nice and comfortable for kids,
Great way to connect with family even if they are not and for chatting with friends too,
Cannot add account at all.... account creation failure but no help in how to fix it or at least tell me what im doing wrong,
"Whenever me and my cousin try to send each other photos it doesn't send them to her and it just says ""downloading photo"" whenever she sends me a picture",
It is great for texting friend's if they have a different phones,
Great with younger kids keeping in contact with today evolving technology while keeping them safe too,
It's a very good app for kids to text with each other #good for kids,
It is a fun time to talk to your friends and it is an awsome website i totally recomend it to you,
This is such a great app..... Only thing I wish I'd that the parents had an option to call their kids üòâ,
i love that its safe for daughter to talk to her friends an make new friends she loves the stickers lol i think its an amazin app <3,
This app is amazing! I can text with my friends and family!,
it keeps telling me I have the wrong password but it's the same password that I've been using for my Facebook so I know it's not wrong,
This app is great for kids it allows them to talk to family and I know when they are on and whi they talked to.,
I can safley talk to my friends and not get hacked.As well as play fun games while in a call.It is the best.,
Since I am only 10 and I don't have a properly hooked up phone messenger kids is a great way to communicate with my parents and cousins so I would definitely recommend for your children,
"Very good, add option to delete profile picture or option to hide profile picture.",
Love this app so much but something is bothering me i ca not use a different pictures out of my gallery for my profile pictures please fix it but besids that it is a great app,
Its very good and it would be much better for the kids to use then messages so thats why i rate is a 5üòÅ,
Great just when u dont talk to someone in a whilr they just dissaper and u cant talk to them anymore üò•üò•üò•üò• also once your parents sleep mode it when it turns back on it says unable to send i hate this app,
Fun i love it i can talk to all my fam and friends games are also good to but they need more filters so pls add more filters ü•∞,
I love this app. It's given my children a chance to connect with friends and family that are far away.,
it takes a llllllllllloooooooonnnngggg time to load and 2 times it didn't load at all but I guess it's ok üëç,
Sound issues with last update. Don't respect silent mode on galaxy s20 Roll back to v160.0.0.10.117 pure fixed that,
It √∂ lyrics filter and stuff break down even on my iPhone 11 and x pro so yeah √∂ and my cousins android phone it don't work ne their on a tablet,
"The app is hacked it hacked my account and sent people ""is this you in that picture?"" And it has a link attached and i told people not to click it because i did not type that abd it happened to my cousin too please check that out.",
Im angry you cant share links or choose a profile photo or audio call. I wish these could be fixed >3,
"this would be great in FACEBOOK PORTAL.. too bad, my child can't use portal with messenger kids. more parental control.",
"I'm a kid and this game is fun because I can talk to my friends Katelyn, Nikki, and Evelyn it's very fun! üòÅüòÄüòÑüò∏‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíôüíòüíùüíûüíó",
This is a great way to chat with my friends and be safe from hackers or other people I don't like or want to talk to I would give this a one million star if I could,
Best app ever since we are still stuck at home all of the kids can't talk so this app let's you talk.,
I give this four stars because it is good but i wish that would put more filters like face filters that thau use on tik tok,
The only thung that could change is how its picture/picture I'd like to see the other person's picture bigger,
I'm so excited my kids are using this app and they can chat with their friends and they were so happy üòÇüòÅ this is the best app ever,
It is very fun bc younger kids dont have access for like whatsapp and all that stuff and messanger kids you can chat with your friends,
i love this app it allows you to talk in a safer & more kid expressive way cold messenger kids your kids can be save on the app and can also have fun just like adolts do but hou do have to ask your parents or guardians to open it for them they will have the time of there lifes but you can also make rules and things you want your children to remember üòâüòúüòú and remember dont lit your kids have any other social media intell they are at list 12 13 and don't let your kids talk to starangers,
This app would never find my account. I uninstalled it and try again and it still didnt work .,
I cannot see the things grandkids send me do NOT understand how this works. And I know alot of people who can't figure this out. I down load the app put in their names. If I put in mine it says I'm too old. But then it acts like I am my grandkids.,
Great app to keep in touch with grand children or even great grandchildren.,
It's okay I don't like the fact that you have to take a picture of your face when we could use a photo but no we can't 2-5,
I talk to my cousin's all the time on this app and I love it great quality camera and cute filters,
Love it. My kids are talking and getting in touch with their cousins even if we are so far away. And i can be calm because it is kid friendly and easy.,
This is such a good app bc i can call my friend while quarantine and i can call 2 of my frien ds at the same time.,
What if the parent doesnt have a Facebook acount?? Di you just not get in?? I dont get why social media has to be necessary for a kids app. Like come on! At least ask go like a phone number or email address because not everybody has a Facebook account,
This app sucks because every time I come in it tells me about stuff I dont even want to know about. And everytime I get a call it logs me out of what I'm doing at the moment,
It is a really fun you can play games with your friends no glitching and your parents are in control of who you talk to!,
Nfi how to just connect with my child on this without making another account thats not my own facebook.. like.. why can't this be incorporated into facebook messenger,
I like that the child can't delete any conversations. You get to see everything they do.,
This app is great but it keeps unistalling some times when i get into it. P.S i'm a kid :),
Im a kid and this helps me stay connected with my friends and family. It helps so much! 10/10 for sure.,
Its so much fun I get to text and call all of my best friends and I get to talk to my family membersüòúüíõüíöüíôüíúüíìüíïüíñüíûüíòüíó‚ù§üíé YAAAAAAAAAAAY I rlly like this app itd soo much fun baai!,
"Great app for the kids that let them chat with their friends, which is great in the stay home nice now",
You can see who and what your child is saying and talking to. Good for kids just getting a phone!,
Good app for Kids to communicate with friends and family.,
I love it so I can communicate with all my friends my parents my cousins everyone I know and it's really fun I really recommend you try it out.,
this is so good for kids it's just great but is there a way to not make grown a pet so laggy,
"new to this!... giving it a try for my daughter. Hope it works out but only thing is i can't delete a account which sucks a lot since i made 2 same account, where can i add people from my contacts?",
Perfect my child loves this app she can text her friends and me!she loves to use filters,
"my sister can not spell, but because of this app she can make videos with and without filters.",
"This app is amazing I get get to talk with my friends and family, This app is 100% the best app!!!",
This is a great app theres a healthy habbits game great for pandemic and you can ask pepole for their code and you can talk to them this is a great app‚ô•üòá,
Cool and fun I am always in contact with My friends and is super easy to Use,
Messager kids is when kids can text and call friends and family. With the control of parents and what I mean by that is parents control over their kids contacts. Also messager kids is safe very safe. Trust me when I say that your kids will absolutely love the fun fillter`s and games. And this review was Written by a 9 year old kid ü§£,
I love keeping in contact with my child and see what she's into and what she is doing on it and she has friends on it and family on it and I have her friends and family online it is pretty interesting to have,
I rated this a four because sometimes it freezes and it doesn't have many filters,
"I like it, by the way there is no normal voice call.The colours are also not good",
Its amazing! I TOTALLY recommend it! I can talk to so many people! And it's so easy!,
Great because it allows my ex husband to safely talk to our daughter üìûüòÄ when he is not around.,
It is the best app ever my friends are in quarantine so this really helps me be able to talk tr I them,
I love this app but I can't get a picture from my gallery for my profile and all of my friends have have pictures from there gallery,
Its great! My minor can stay in contact with preapproved people.,
kids can talk on it there mom can see it tho and they can also see what you text the person im for real your cuz and you can to and your freind this is a very good app,
This app is the best messeging app i love using anywhere and its has fun game! fun stickers! I love ill doawnload it on my laptop also!,
I love this app for i can face time with multiple friends at a time!,
Very nice 8 love it my kids can use it to text there friends and me! üòª,
Ecos if two people call a they are using the same WiFi but everything else is perfect,
Great way for my kids to keep up with friends...especially through this pandemic,
I don't think you should have to sign in because most parents don't want to sign in and your kids should be able to get on the app and be able to have fun,
Will not let me verify my account and keeps saying try again later. Kind of pointless if you can't even fully install and use the app,
this is a good app! but the reason I give this 4 stars is cause it crashes sometimes. recommended app,
Ive had this app sevral times the reason why i give it 5 stars is because u can talk to ur freinds there are no adds and a lot of other things,
this app is ok but why face book? i mean i'm 7 but why not just messenger? what if you're mom or dad dosent have face book? i'm not trying to be mean but whay face book? i mean you can't change it now so to soon right? and hafe of it dosent work. CHANGE IT TO MESSENGER BUT IT'S TO SOOON and why are the profile pic's so DANG SMALL BRO plz MAKE A NEW GAME or i ment APP change you're dang game pepole,
"Great way to communicate with my grandchildren is a safe clean cut involvement sharing life's experience pictures school experiences day to day happenings with out the drama like facebook tweeter Instagram etc have with all the hate, war mongers, sexuality, foul language on and on..",
It helps me connect and still have parental controls I just wish you could change ringtones and have more gifs,
"It's very nice you can talk with anyone who you know, but the adults have more stuff than kids can u guys put more stuff for kids please.",
"Good quality, funny face things, no limit on calls, games.",
If I could add the contacts that we need added I would give 5 stars! Sent an email today.,
Make it so you can keep the angry face and other faces on for more than 5 seconds,
"I was able to reach anyone but, sometimes it would've gliched and it annoys me.",
This is weird how it logged me out and I had a family's there so can y'all fix it cuz I ain't gonna wait all day until this thing doesn't get fixed but it's still a 5 —ï—ÇŒ±—è—ï,
"Cool,awesome,and fun to do with all of the variates of optionsüòÅüëç",
It's so fun cus you can text your friends and have alot of fun face timeing and play games,
It keeps crashing when my daughter tries to use the camera mode.,
Can't video call. The video call is a black screen.,
It will not allow you to close the messanger for the child and use regular messanger or facebook.,
Very good but i wish you could add more popular stickers to send!,
Having a lot of trouble using this app. It won't let me use the parental controls and it won't let me see what my daughter's brother sent her so she can talk to him. Can you help?,
This game is so much fun I can add my friend I can have my cousin of my family members too so that's why I can stay sting a five-star!!!!!!!,
should have more games for the kidos to play. also goes in and out of calls often,
"After update, the call ends without pressing the ""X"" button. Please fix this",
Good it's a good app you can chat with friends especially since quarantine,
I love this app it is a really good app to comunicate with your friends and family and i get to comunicate with my crush‚ù§ and my family and friends so i would recamend you download this game,
Good i can text and lots of fun filters also teaches u how to use big messenger,
"My daughter enjoys being able to contact her friends, chat and play games together.",
"That's the only way i can chat with my daughter right now, but i'm not getting any notifications at all, and it seems that i'm not the only one having that problem",
I can get in touch with all my closest friends. So you should download the app instantly!üòÇ,
This app is great and there's so many games but the game called Yog artist hangs even when is internet.,
My granddaughters love it. They say it teaches them responsibility. So far they have been a member for almost a year with no issues Thanks messenger kids.,
Just downloaded so haven't had much time using the app. But what a novel idea for kids.,
every time i open this app it crashes i guess this doesnt work on chrome books,
I love this app because it lets you FaceTime your friends if they missed you because this Coronavirus!,
This is awesome. And very safe for kids like me. So you should have this for your kid so if the get in to a emergency then they can just call you.,
Good app when people talk to friends and family I think it's a great app,
AWESOME! The only bad part is that there is a lot of setup for the parents.,
Can't even open it up once installed. Some kind of error,
Very appropriate for small children and parents can manage who there child talks to very useful,
I can text my family and friends its awesome and I understand it and there is fun games to play,
Cute app to chat with my daughter and she can have fun facetimes with her cousins that live hours away.,
I love this app because you can FaceTime and text your friends when ever you want,
I love this kids app i mean i get to talk to freinds. I do not have any sisters or brothers so i am the 1 child i am 8 years old i have a cat that WONT STOP MEOWING!! Ugh his name is bella i am going to get a dog and my dad left he didnt die but my mom and dad got into i fight soo ya. My point is i love this app it is the best and i love it. Kaylee wrote that (not me-Stacey),
I dont like it because you can talk to strangers and it takes forever to download on my ipad,
"Messenger Kids is sooooooooooo good! You can text to your friends and face time them to. You can also grow your own pet, Messenger Kids is the best thing you will find!",
slow and the filters aren't working right they are lagging and whenever i call someone it laggs,
i love this app its awsome when i can't go to some one i can call or text im an 8 year old,
It has filters it listens to you correctly on the sound speaker!,
Its super fun i can talk to alll my friends oh btw this is a child speaking from the kid point of view thank you who ever made this app was it facebook any thank you,
I can text all my friends it is a great app worth taking up space and downloading!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,
I love this app because you can talk to your family or your friends or even your friends if you have any friends and you could you could play games with your family or friends like 18 and like catch moths,
it seems good the only problem so far is you can't turn the camera around.,
The app is an easy to use app for kids. The challenge is the time limitation by parents,
"Love this app, keeps me in the loop with who he is speaking too and how.. i love it.",
Reply good app for if your kids want to talk to your friends and it's very safe,
very confusing... been workingon this awhile and still not completely set up,
Installed at request of my granddaughter and her mother. It gave me an opportunity to link to a list of kids i dont know!! Deleted the app. Enciuraging my daughter to do the same.,
great app for children. you can control who they talk to and when. this was a great idea,
It is very easy for me and my freimds to communicate and i love the emojis to!,
It is awesome I can talk to my friends and family members but the on thing is that you can change you profile pic to something from you albums,
I think it is ridiculous how you have to go through so many steps and password this and that. This site is a joke. I wouldn't use it if my grandkids didn't ask me to,
Yes I really love this app! My child have to go thru his mommy to go further his friends and what he's doing yesssss! 5starz,
"so far so good what I like about it, is that its give you the parent piece of mind because you can control who your children are talking to as only you can invite people to talk with your kiddo. This way you don't have to worry about creepy old men talking to your little girls or in my case some teen boy trying to chat with my 9 year old daughter so when I say piece of mind I mean just that! I truly hope you enjoy this app with your kiddos!",
I like this for my child who is starting to learn independence and chatting to her friends. This will come in handy with monitoring and educating her on the proper online etiquette,
Made a mistake and added someone we didn't want. Now that person cant be taken off unless we block them. Should just be able to take them off and have them deleted,
I like it it's fun and cool I get to text my sister on here it's really fun if u don't have dis app u should download,
I can always talk to family and close friends! I love this app. I use it a lot more then when i first got it.,
"Great, it has the best filters and even games to play with friendsüòÅüòÅü§óü§óüòÜüòÜ",
My kids can use it to text her friends and it makes her really happy,
Im not that happy with this it takes FOOORRRREEEEVVVVEEERR to load the games to play and how it makes u chat is rly anooying so sorry guys but 2 stars.,
I have a good experience with talking to friends and fmaily with this app sometimes it glitches but i love it,
"love the app, but would be great if my daughter could play games on it just like in regular messenger",
So far easy to use and my child is happy to talk to her friends.,
This is a great app and a great way to keep in touch with family during Covid-19.,
because it's so fun we get to text Aldi our friend and it's really fun we get to do fun things on it and I just want to read adistar cuz it's so fun,
I'm confused as I'm having difficulties with it. It does not accept my Facebook password.,
"It is good for kids and it,s like messager but for kids and well less filters",
very good service im on it almost 24\7 calling my friend. you neeeeeeed to try this or else,
Very great for kids and you can talk with family and friends and plus now it has games on it,
"This is a good app for children because parents can supervise their kids, while their kids have fun!",
it is a nice app to play with your friends I really like it especialy at this time covid 19. 5/5,
"I absolutely LOVEEEE this Kids Messenger app, I really think that by making an account. That by far, is the best decision I could of ever made as a mother!!!.",
this app is the best and you can talk to every body its so fun you get to om talk to your frands its so much fun,
It is good for kids but it is so glitches when you are saving photos,
It's cool although I hate when I have already read a message and it still a how's the notification,
This app ran fine until it came up for an update. Now it wont even open.,
It's like messages but it's not like as much adult stuff like messenger kids for kid messages is for adults.,
I downloaded the app on my kids tablet / the one I am using and logged him in but it won't let him see the text and won't let me add friends for him,
I can talk with friends and family it is great for children and It fixes solely mistakes,
I like it it's fun I like grow your pet.You can do a lot of things!üòÑüòÑü§ó,
Fun app that is kinda like snapchat but their is no story wear anyone can see. Fun filters and you can only talk to kids that you know the account.,
This app is WAY to inclusive to Samsung we dont get cool updates or filters it's not fair and my friend got the new update so I dated messenger kids and ot did nothing like hers it just stayed the same way pls dont be so mean to us Samsung user's,
"Needs to have parental settings,make it easier to switch from kid to kid",
Love this app great for my under age children to keep in contact with close family an friends,
This app is pretty good it is a nice app for kids I gave it a 4 because it is a good app but some of the games glitch a little,
"Complicated to get set up, instructions aren't clear as to how to do it and how it works.",
Very confusing won't send me notifications that I can action or add friends without a code,
Love using this with my son. He enjoys talking to his grandma and using the other features.,
I try ed putting my email when I got it but it keeps on saying they couldn't find it so I deleted it I'm telling you it's horible,

"This is a great app it is safe,fun and a great way to keep up with your friends and family!",
I can't open it even though if I put my password there it load but after a few minutes it died,
This app is good for my child and it is a nice app and i can see what my son is typing his photos he send it is good,
I love talking to friends and family in a safe way best app ever.,
ok but not great has nice features but well if your facebook account isnt old enough they wont let u make account,
it was working at first but as time went on it kept on loging out plz fixxxxxxxxxxxxx‚úåüòüüôÖüò≠üò≠,
I love this I can text and face time I love the filters so child friendly,
Its good but sometimes it exits the call while im playing games with a certent person.,
"Maybe add a ""dark mode"" or ""night mode"" feature? The bright white hurts my eyes.",
i love the app but i would like to be able to use bitmojis,
It's an amazing app I get to talk to my friends and I love video calling and someone says something mean you can report .,
This app takes up way too much storage when you can just get a better messaging app like Snapchat Instagram Etc,
It is AMAZING I love it so much but I wish it had more updates like snapchat but it is a really good app!,
It doesn't work like regular massage hard to.work..family members get disconnected. Etc,
This is a fantastic app let's kids spend time with family and friends and share photos as well as keeping parents in the loop so they know their children are safe,
"Had to uninstall this app to re-install, some weirdo got my information and decided to take over my 6 yrs account.",
It's a good app but it is very weird if you spam texts it said you are a parent,
I love this app for my daughter now even on long holidays she can stay connected to school friends,
I enjoy talking to my friends bet it needs to update alot and vdeo chating is very laggy And The app almost never works,
I love it you can call friends at games and other fun stuff thanks for creating it üç©üíôüòç‚ú®,
My mom or me now how to add people or I wished that in profile it would let you put a profile picture....not very good app,
I love it its super fun and really easy to get new people!,
"My childs account said it needs to be Read revalidate it again when we try too, says canner find the account and is says "" something went wrong while setting up your kids account try again"" but it keeps giving us that same message",
It is a good way for kids to connect with other kids without using the messages for adults,
Messenger kids is sooo fun!! I can already talk to all my friends whenever I WANT!!! and video chat with my friends!!! This app is a GREAT thing to download for everyone!!! üòéüòéüòé,
This app is very easy to use but I gave it 4 because of the innopropiate lady Halloween addition.,
1st off...I cant send gifs! Please fix that 2nd some times lags out of call,
Oh Obeasly this app is very very nice for me. I like this app very muchüëåüëå. This is very easy & desy app. So Best of lucküëçüëç,
This is good for if u need to talk to friends that don't have a phone or number u can contact them anyway.,
its a fun app but it keeps uninstalling i have to reinstall about every other day.,
Sos for my daughter's tablet when she texted her nephew her key border goes down and the app goes to its logo screen and she tried to text and it does it again,
When I got on here it said that I had to use Facebook to get on here and I'm 11 I don't have Facebook like my dad isn't a cool guy that gets their kids Facebook got freaking 9 years old no he has Facebook when I'm like 15 like but it is still really good I can talk to some of my friends and my dad's account...,
Very handy little feature! We all love it! :),
I can do everything I want I can text all my friends and family members you can text people all around the world I recommend it,
I love the app but why wont ut let me change the profile pic..and why i mean i have a lot of accounts because i keep on making the profile picture..please fix this...,
You HAVE to sign in with Facebook. What if you don't have a Facebook account like me. I'm not just going to make a Facebook account to sign in to a messenger app. That's so stupid. Sorry but it is.,
I really think it's a great app although I do have some problems a couple times,
Good i guess.. but i cant figure out hownto let her dad have access to message her etc without being a friend to him. Andni absolutely do not want to have that connection.,
Good app for my son to use to connect with his distant and out of state cousins.,
Finely the admins fix it to work! Thank you! Is very cute app overall!,
"If you are a kid you will maybe want to text like grownups so if adalts text on messenger your kids can be safe on messenger kids heres a few things you need to know if your childs friend or family send something you don't want your kid to see you can remove it but she or he who sended it will still see it also your parents can see what you sent and the person who is texting you ,your parents can see what they sent, That's it for now",
"Amazing, My kids love talking to there friends this app is amazing for kids",
It just is so cool that I can text and call my friends and just say what I want It is a amazing app so keep on doing what you are doing I love this app‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,
Poor. May be my device has been hijacked. Unable to confirm myself.,
it's so great I see people online and when they were online like 2 hours ago it's so great!!!!!!!!!!,
It is a great app for kids. Me and my 2 sisters have it and all love it...,
Turned off all notification but app still rings parent's phone. Soooo annoying,
Only facebook login...the app should allow for other platforms to have an account.,
I cannot retrieve the message. This app is complicated and not easy to use.,
I love the app it's great you can text people it's so fun activities I am just love this app,
I love the app but can you please put the puffer fish filter back because I loved it so muchüôèüôèüôèüôè‚ù§,
I love this app you can text your friends and people it's the best app ever,
Love talking to the grandbabies...even if we talk and text a million times an hour!! LOL,
love it it's a great app for my 10 year old to stay in touch with her friends..,
I cant even sign in every time I try it says this user is not allowed to log into this app can someone please explain what is going on?,
I love kids messenger because it is a great way to contact with people and face time,
I was installing it and filling out all the information and I tried to sign in and it didn't work. Please help me.,
it is a good message app for kids because on the other one their is pedifiles.,
Its fun to talk to feiends and family with it like amessage app but better and for kids like me 5/5 loved it Ps recomend,
I absolutely love this app. It is kid - friendly and it's appropriate.,
"This app is good for saying hi to friends or family or whatever, in my opinion it is, its cool",
Love being able to stay in contact with my child great app,
Its the best it keeps you entertained you can have fun and text your friends and family,
Well it would be good if you put a name in it will show up it would be a lot better that way but other than that it is awsome,
This app is very difficult to use. I really don't like it at all. Its complicated and we don't enjoy it.,
I enjoy this it lets kids talk together and play games over the internet so it pretty good my only complaint is how you say hello you do it with a gif witch doesn't bother me but someone out there is gonna complain about it because you don't get to say hello in any other way!Edit: again this doesn't Bother me but it is weird how you can only say hello with a gif because you could easily fix this by giving the option to say hello with pictures or videos it would help them meet A LOT MORE...PLEASE,
I've uninstalled and reinstalled this app on my daughters tablet multiple times and it wont even open,
"Its a good app, with the games and stuff, but it won't notify me when my sister messages me.",
I just like it because you can do stickers and its good for kids,
So I waited this for because this app is just so good it helps keep people connected and it's just so good!,
Why is there no selfie mode for camera or video chat?! My kids can't have fun while chatting with their friends.,
I cannot contact anyone or pick up messages. Have supposedly had it over a year to contact my grandchildren and still can't.,
Its very nice but when we play a game the phone closes and then we call again and again,
I would totally down load this app it is so great you can text any one it is a wonderful app,
Says account not found!!!! Tried both parents Facebook logins but nothing worked üò§,
well i do not have a phone right now and i had a difficult time becaues i had to have a password so you need to learn how to make stuff without a password so thank you for letting me tell you my expirience.,
It is really cool you can talk to all your friends and family but you have to have them on Facebook,
It's easy to call and text and has a few games for kids in it.,
I just downloaded the game so I don't really know much about it but when you download it make sure you have a Facebook account or you cannot use this,
It was working for so long and then my chulds text wouldnt send anymore,
hi im 10 and i have had this app for 3 mabey 2 years now it works amazing just saying get it if you want your kids to call text people safe i love this app,
its very cool you have cool filters easy to control i hope every parent enjoys this app for kids,
it was pretty good app i can text with people i want with my pearets seing who that is and its a really good app.,
"Its great, it let's me text my friends without having to pay!",
"I love it üòç it's free,kid friendly,and approachable for all children ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞",
It good but need a bit more emojis but it is very good for kids,
Very easy to use and feel really safe with my kid using it! (:,
This is great can follow on his profile feel better knowing that he is safe on site.,
it is so cool that you can do just little things like vidoe chats and text,
Not letting me create the account it's just telling me that there is a error it needs to be fixed ASAP,
Good for kids. My mom love the app. And I can FaceTime my friends,
You call and chat it a great way to chat or call someone you missed or moved but you have a silly password which you can give to others and they can chat but you need to have your parents be friends on facebook.,
Great and safe way for my 4yr old to contact family and friend. Easy for him to use.,
I would like as a parent to be able to delete messages if I deem it Proprietary to do so.,
I like this app me and my friend calls all the time I don't have no problems with this app!üòå,
I open messeger kids for my son but now just cant open it. So it make me to do all the account think and it only say acount creation failure,
I love this app I am one of the kids who use this app and i love it is super fun and you get to talk you friends orfamily,
Amazing app. Safe for children to use and is very fun and cool,
I had it before and it is a good app even for a 14yo I do think it is a bit glochy when taking long distance though,
I LOVE IT BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM In the emoji's THERE IS NO ARGENTINA FLAG.I think this is a good app beside that problem,
This lets me keep in contact with me BFF and she is the best friend in the world try getting a best friend that will never let you down at ALL times so the is why you NEED to get the app.,
great experience for my son plus I monitor who's calling and texting. ..,
Best thing ever i loked it becuase i dont have to use my moms phone or her stuff and i like how you have to put a code to add people so only people you know is in the chat box i loved it.,
"Excellent way to communicate with your grandchildren, especially whilst in lockdown ü§ó",
it is great and all but you can't save videos! :((((,
This is a very safe app and very good for kids who like to chat to their friends,
Not one name that came up was my grand daughters parent. The one and only person I joined this app to play and talk to,
downloaded just fine but the app wont open. very annoying.,
Best app I just wonder if you can add more funny cute filters!,
I love messenger kids! It's easy for me to talk to family members and friends even if i don't have their numbers.,
I created a stupid account i can't delete and my daughter's messages don't get a notification on my phone i have to open the f'ing app to see she's offline,
it was working fine but now kicks you back to screen. useless,
Messenger kids is great it is supper easy it is not add after add it is fun I love it!,
My daughter keeps getting *unable to send* messages when she tries to chat to her friends. How can I solve this problem?,
Haven't completely set it up. It seems very user-friendly.,
It WAS going well but Anisa's acct is unable now! She can no longer chat with any of her contacts!,
Good app I love it. It let's me talk to my friends and tells me if they are online or not.,
Very easy for kids to use and they love keeping in touch with family.,
I love this app but you need internet to have it work so it does not make me that happy when I can't talk with my friends.,
"It's an amazing app. it doesn't take up much space, it is kid friendly and I love it.",
I really like it but there are some games on there that I can't play and it's not the parental controls,
This game is so fun I hope that everyone can see this App because it's so cool so just get this app i LOVE this ‚ìê‚ìü‚ìü ‚ìò alreyde have so mane freins so ya if i didn't have it i wold have no way to see my freind. üíñüíùüíòüíóüíì,

A great way for kids to interact with older family members who are connected to the regular Messenger app,
I love this app because I can text and call all of my friends that have it and my parents can controll who I talk to on there facebook acount and when I want to sign in on another divice I can sign in with my parents facebook pasword,

It is a amazing app that i can chat with friends and family just with a code,

It's so amazing I'm giving it a 5-star review cuz it's amazing and I hope you guys download it and you guys think about it it's amazing,
It is great for my kids it's simple and easy and I can pick who I want him to talk to and no one else's get in,
"I love messenger kids because it allows you to text and video chat, it's the best!!!",
It is a good app for kids to call friends and family members to call and text,
I love this app kids can text their friends parents grandparents and more!,
Never lets me see pictures my friends / family send. Very annoying and slowüòëüòí‚òπÔ∏è,
It has never been so easy to comunicate with Kids. Thanks Mark.,
"So I got this so my kids can keep in contact with their friends. I cant add ANY of my friends' kids, and half of the kids messages come to my (adult) messenger. Waste of space on my phone. Will be deleting a.s.a.p",
It is a great safe way for my child to talk with Friends!,
"Whenever I go to put in my email it says no account found, I even went into my facebook account to make sure it was the right one .",
It's good and all but the bit I hate is that when U wanna grow ur pet but it takes AGES to load.,
I love this app I can talk with family and use filters to goof around with the fliters,
The kids side could be looking more like the actual messenger voice call. Its half a screen and not a screen inside a screen,
Very good helps my son talk to his friends and family communicate safely.,
"Great, my kids love chat to there friends and family when they are kilometres away from each other!",
"No audio call, Mr Zuckerberg wants only video, wondering why üòâüòú Asked why you have""3rd"" party content filtering, no answer pas!",
I love this app I can't wait to have more friends to talk to and share videos I hope covid will go so I can see my family and friends like if you aggre,
this app is the best like omg other kids should get this I can call chat and choose filters it's sooo AWESOME.,
"I love the app. I love chatting and call my friends. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, GET IT!!!",
great and very easy to use. i feel like my little one is safe from preditors,
Still not recognizing my account for authorization but works on another device. Please update again!!!,
Honestly I have so much friends on this app it's great for when your away but I hate how the filters I like go away but still I love this app so that's why I gave it 5 stars because il love it,
You can't even change your child's profile picture from your own gallery!!,
App has not been launching for the past 3 days even after reinstalling.,
omg i love your app so much my mom wont let me get real texting so this is how i communicate to my friends and family thank you so much for getting this app for me im so thnkful thank u,
I can chat with my friend that doesn't have a phone! It's the best app ever made!!,
It's a good app but you need to add filters for pets! Also bring back the pig game!,
Okay once we got the hang of it. Set up and adding is kinda confusing,
seems okay. I just installed it. I don't like having to complete tasks to advance my membership,
Yes is very good! For your children to connect witt family members.,
The text is bugging me most of the time and it doesn't have smooth internet,
"you know haw its covid 19 well messenger kids is so good,i love spending time with my friends on thare its so funny,fun,sweet i LOVE IT so i thing YOU will love it TO,dawnlod it for FREE",
I love it it's so fun to see how it goes at a fun way the calls are so fun and I made my own pet,
"Sorry, this app just isn't for me, rules are meant to be broken u no and u hav 2 respect other ppls privacy, besides u can't get pictures from gallery which sucks, and hey I respect ur tryna keep us ""kids"" safe and all but this is to controlling, I'm like 18 and it's my last year, u no but thx 4 uploading this app anyways",
This game is great for talking to friends I talk to my friends and family on this app this is the best app ever I hope you enjoy the app too,
Don't work won't ven open I downloaded it eraced it and re downloaded it still don't work,
"I love this . I can see how my grands are , what they are up too, it's better then just a normal call. I love they can have a social media presence an create a really cool Facebook page.. also no adults except for family can see his page comment or ask him personal questions. There are to many sickos these days .. I total think ppl who sexually abused any child ,baby, pre- teen , cant hit any of my babiez up ..",
I dont like the way it doesnt even have a call thing it only says facetime so you can only facetime only which it sucks,
Great way for kids to easily and safely communicate with family and friends,
Very convenient and safe way for young children to communicate.,
Super fun way for kids to stay connected with friends and family during √ßovid,
Sometimes it pixels up and doesn't work I really like it because parents can wach what their kids are doing,
Installed it and won't let me create account. Won't let me authorize keeps saying my fb password is wrong and it not,
I love Messenger Kids. I get to talk to my friends and send fun videos. its so awsome.üòÖ,
It is i audio call or voice call 2..if this account could be added to messenger group. 3.chat head option would be available 5. Messege and call notification are avisible 6.. could be add some details like school etc,
The only thing that I don't like about it is when you add your friends you have to put in a code I wish you can just put in their name,
It seems like a good app but it keeps on having trouble on signing in,
Idk it never gives me a notification when someon messages me and how the heck do you make ur pfp something from your gallery,
I gave it 4 stars because it is kinda glichy but i can see talke and play games with my friends and family so its cool,
This app is great for my child highly recommend it instead of using Messenger do not give that app for your kids it's actually an adult app that's why you should use this app and that's why it's called messenger kids because it's for kids and teenagers only,
this is a good app if you have kids because if you have kids you don't know what they're texting you you don't even notice if they're on drugs and stuff go with this it's a safe they cannot make any bad things and you always know what they're texting so I hope this review helps you,
i love the app but you cant share links for a zoom meeting or something like that ya know links and stuff,
"Extremely useful for contacting and fun, too!",
It is An AMAZING APP but 5 monthes in it wouldnt let me call send an vid or talk and i am still having trouble,
this app is so good and I have many fun with my friends and I really love this app and I have tell all of my friends about this app because it's really so lovely and I wish you enjoy bey‚ù§üç´,
I love the independence this app gives my son to talk to our family and still know he is safe!,
I love this app you can talk to your friends if you can't go somewhere to see them!,
Great way for family and close friends to safely use messenger for children!,
This app is great for kids and fun for parents too! I love the app!,
Video calls lasts 5 seconds then it freezes and shuts down.,
Useless app. Unable to register if you're not the parent.,
My messages don't come up and it doesn't give me an option to search them to find them.,
it is a great way to communicate with friends and family and you can use cool filters,
It's A great app every kid should use it it's creative and fun everybody should use it!,
this sucks! I can't open messenger it kicks me out! there is a glitch nobody can use it. DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!!!!,
My kids love it. Video chats with funny faces are their favorite.,
I am upsety that I can't screen share. Other than that this a pretty good app. :),
App has been great helping me communicate with kids on chat as well as video.,
My daughter enjoys being able to talk to her family and friends especially during this hard times in the world.,
I think it was just a lot of fun but I don't like when you have to go through all of the information that it needs,
Must know parent names to connect with other children. My kids don't know their friends parents names. Other than that love it.,
My kid can text and call me when there's trouble I love this app so much I love it,
I love this app only thing I dont like is not being able to delete the messages afterwards,
Would be great if you could connect with the scrapbook feature,
"All of a sudden, its not letting me send gifs. As im still a kid and all i talk to are my siblings, i feel like should be able to send them still. please fix amd i will give 5 stars",
I love this app it let's me chat with my kids very easly it is free and I think it is amazing 5 star,
"Love it, just wish i could pick the words for the 4 word code...",
So fun able to talk to friends hang out and make a pet.So fun just fun!,
This is just no good because there is no friend alerts and only parent alerts,
well I like it but people text me and call me to much I think they should put a do not disturb you thing on this app but ether way I love it,
Love it! My daughters can talk via text or video with their cousins and our family members.,
I love this app because I get to talk to my friends. It also helps me connect with them after school.,
I think my mom would love me to have this app instead of the adult version because she has more control to keep me safe and still give me the opportunity to have fun by talking to my friends and family,
I love this app I use it 24/7 although I love regular messenger I feel more safe/secure with this app. I'm a kid and I love bananas.,
Love that I can keep track of my child's messages and control who contacts them.,
I love messenger kids my kids love the filters the only problem is it takes a lot of space,
Great so far. I love that I can see everything being sent back and forth.,
I really love this app so a lot but when I video chat my mom it freezes o lot And I text my mom dad cuzin It's so easy to I love it,
Great for young kids without a phone. Love this service,
safe way fot my children to interact without actually having access to facebook. I can monitor who I add or who can be accepted keeping pervs and crazies away!,
"love this app, my son can get ahold of me but he does not have fb or a cellphone and I know all his messeges to friends and family.",
This app is amazing !!!~but it can be very lage great for kids,
"This app is a good, safe way for kids to communicate with others. I highly recommend it! üòä",
Yes i love it cause i kno my kid is more safe and im the one who adds the friends and things of that source!,
Its gr8 but it needs more stickers. And maybe add chat heads.,
I think it's great a good way for my child to communicate with family,
"I'm able to chat and video chat with my kids. It's so easy to work with. To start you only instal. Kids can be able to chat with anyone parents approve. Thats why I'm staying with it, I can control her group without kids feeling ruled on.",
"I very much enjoy that Facebook has made a messenger for children that can be closely monitored by parents. Facebook, you earned every one of those stars right there!",
hard to get messages at the same time( in sync),
It is very entertaining for kids. I like that I get to manage who they can talk to.,
Awesome app for the kids to keep in contact with Family and friends.,
Great app I wish I could have group chats with both my grandsons at the same time.,
"Such an amazing app, I can text all my best friends.",
This app is amazing üòç my kid loves it he can finily talk to his friends and family,
it great fro little kid's who have friend's long awayand they can talk ! it's for laptop ipad and phone's it's for all thing's,
I am trying to get on for the past couple of hours... Keeps telling me I have wrong password and to get temporary....when I put in temp..it tells me to try again and again!!!! What is going on???????,
Unable to change the profile pic other than to take a new photo. Why can't you upload a new one?,
This is the best app it helps me know how to... Call people better then on messenger becuse i can call my friend tesla very easy.,
It's amazing it's like regular mesenteric but not as fancy and more safe,
When I send like a vid it takes forever to load and some times it says not able to send ANDS NOT EVEN INAPPROPRIATE üò°,
just downloaded and it continuously crashes before I can even open it,
This app is very good my daughter loves it she can talk to her cousin's and can tell her when to get off,

Well I I'll try on my tablet cause my phone is was not working at all so I have to try my tablet because I don't wanna see texts disabled,
I love it but Sometimes i am on a call and it hangs up Automatically,
I Love kids have a safe place to communicate with each other. Easy to use. Easy for Parents to monitor.,
"The kid doesn't have his own phone number. So when I use my number, he can see all of my messages. That's not good.",
im on a computer and it wont work when it says open for all devices how do i fix this,
App logged child out and cannot get back in after several months of use with no issues,
I like the app kids have fun I wish you could add someone using a phone number or email like my dad who doesn't have FB,
"I can't make an account, I re installed multiple times but still can't make an account.",
sometimes it doesn't even work and the messages don't go through to the other person,
Our kids can talk and there are new filter we are very interested in this app for our kids üòçüòôüòó,
This game is so good and I think there's nothing I can improve on and it is really just like a kid Facebook thank you for making this at,
My child can talk to her friends and I have full control of her contact list and I know what she's talking about.,
Its horrible and there are a lot of glitches it doesn't let me delete friends or leave groups and I just hate it,
massenger kids is a app that you can call and text without a number and it makes it safer without a number,
AMAZING!! I would definitely install this app because with COVID-19 it lets you just talk and have fun so I highly recommend it üòäüòä,
Will not let me set up an account for my child. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times.,
"5 star because I feel bad that like no one likes the app and this is 1 star because I tried adding someone but I don't know what was wrong but I couldn't add my friend so I hate this and the stupid kept coming and I don't care if the girl wanted to talk to grandpa, I want to talk to my grandpa and no one likes chickens so yeah",
This is the best app ever its realy realy realy fun it is a app where you can text your kid im happy this app is a thing.,
This app is so fun I can face time and call my best friends SO COOL!,
I love this app. I can connect to all my friends that have messenger kids but why do some people have updated ones? But anyways I love messenger kids my God sis lives far away and this is easier to talk to her.,
This app sucks u tried to login but it just said your accounts couldn't be found and I don't recommend this app to anyone,
"The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars it's because I'm not able to text, but I'm able to face time. So yeah.",
It's fun and all but I hate that on one of the games you can only play once a day but other than that this app is nice,
I love this app becasue you can talk to all of your friends and yeah thats all I have to say for now!!,
It's only for kids but the only problem is that you need the parents permission to add people but I still give this a five star it's so good,
I've created my sons account solely so I can get in contact with him when we aren't together. I can't add myself so that I am able to contact to him.,
Well it could be better the option not to be able to play like the games really makes it not worth it,
I wish you put the BT21 stickers back on there. They were my favorite.,
Amazing for our children to communicate. Excellent idea messenger kids !!!,
"It's a awesome messenger kids, that's app management is beautiful.",
I gave this app a 4 because i wish there where more colors ypu could chose from.,
"Great app,you can see who they talk to. Parents get full control without the child knowing lol",
it asks me to enter facebook password and i am a kid i havent expierienced the app yet but i am looking forward to it!!!!!,
Can't create an account for child. Asks for their name and birthday then tells me something went won't with an Okay button. No it's not ok it's bs.,
one thing once I take video than I have to have it on portrait but other than that good app Facebook,
Is a great app but for some reason it won't let my daughter text her friends,
it is amazing but the only thing I don't like about it is that you have to be friends with them on Facebook but other or all I love it,
I like the app to text on but I don't know my friends code and we can't see each other cuz of virusüò•üò≠üò¢,
It's not a bad app. Just freezes up sometimes.,
Messenger kids is a great app for saftey. The more saftey the better and more fun.,
"i like how kids can talk to far parents but the internet is horrible and they need to not update every 2 days for a filter or whatever, i understand every couple weeks an update but this is just overboard",
"Not available in your area at this time. If app is meant for kids away from family, why regionalize? When will it become available in Germany?",
It is really good for kids and it is fun and does not lagg much. Me recommend dis app,
"It is a great idea, just wish it were easier to add people.",
i love this app for my daughter she love video chat and she speaks to her mebers a lot. she sends messages i love this app for her.,
Its amazing becase you can text your mom or dad and you can facetime your mom or dad an wen your at home you can send funny and cute pictures to your mom or dad and you can even tell your mom on messenger kids to add someone to text.so it is five stars.download this amazing app to interact with your family (:,

Great app you can communicate with friends and I don't get to see them that much.,
"Good, somehow the app magical as it may be seems to work. Ok, ok, ok!",
Cant add people. It says its waiting for me to approve. I press OK and it keeps saying it. Where to we get notification to approve friends??,
Allright. This app is like a knock off of messenger. Well it is. But how do you make messenger kid friendly?? Like just make parental settings and boom good app. But I have to say I like that you have to tell your parents if you want to add something. EHH,
Its ok i mean the calls keep on droping that could be better but it is cool,
Great way to stay in touch with my younger nieces and nephews So that way there not on regular messenger I think this is a safer way!,
I love it I use this for video calling! I do have a phone # I have had it for a long time. But i use it for video calling and to text friends that don't have a phone or a phone #!,
This app is awesome it lets y talk to people and without them being able to do anything bad I love this app!,
its great if you are little and you want to talk to your friends and you dont have a phone,
I love messenger but me and my mom have so much trouble adding my friends so we can talk to them I just wish Messenger Kids would make it easier.,
this is a great app for kids to contact friends if they don't have a phone,
Keeps saying login failure even though it is the correct password,
For kids I I use you at my dad's house and my mom's house sometimes I can't use it because on my phone is broken but since I'm using my baby brother's iPad I can use it message your kids is amazing app but sometimes when I was saying when I was at my dad's house and I was doing this I wanted to record me calling her doing jelly bean stuff but it didn't let me record kind of not letting me do that it's kind of not making me happy but it was okay because I love messenger kids it's a great app,
It's great for kids like me. I text my mom and dad. I love the filters. :D,
Please change the fact that i cant change my photo by picking one from my gallery for this problem I give you guys one star because it's is bugging me a lot,
"My son loves being able to connect with his friends! He wishes he could change the ring tone on his ""calls""",
"I don't like that after my son calls one of his cousins, it gives a false date and time. Please fix that!",
Hi there is one problem right now i can't text my mom or friends because it thinks I don't have wifi but the messages don't go through,
I wasnt able to get in the app because the appis linked to facebook and my parents dont like facebook. :(,
Great way for our children to communicate with friends and be supervised to keep everything kid friendly,
I love this app. Only the people that i approve are allowed to be on my kids' page. It is so safe and secure.,

Its realy good you can chat or video call and its like snapchat be ause you can use faces on video call,
This app has a great interface and is safe for kids.,
The App is amazing but the only complain I have is that if your on call it glitches really easily,

I love the app but my friend has more features than me and I updated to!,
Messenger Kids is a very good website your parents can see evrey thing you do! They can even controll how much you spen on it! My parents love it it keeps kids safe and you can only add people you know and it sends a nofication to your parents if someone sends you one. I love it it is so fun!,
"It doesn't work very well, we keep trying to connect but doesn't work",
I'm glad I can stay in contact with friends but it glitches me out every ten minutes,
Love how much I can interact with my kids. I do wish I could send videos and pictures to them.,
The video chats are sometimes glitchy and pixelated but still very good,
Please fix the sound. Too low for video calls,
Its a very good app for my kid he has enjoyed with this app and the video call has super clear .................thanks facebook,

It is amazing. It works perfect. No problems whatsoever. <3,
Can't change the sounds or ring tones.,
I love this app but there is just one problem and its thats everytime i talk the call ends,
Great social messaging app for kids that I feel safe and comfortable with my kids using 24 > 7,
I like it but I would want all the stickers that the audalt one has.,
Amazing I love chatting with ma friends especially bc I cant irl right now bc of covid but I would like to be able to change the name of my friends like I wanna get rid of their last names and call my mom mom not her real name,
"Ok,lets play earn a star!i will give you this star (‚òÖ)if you fix this:for android users,it won't let me set a profile from my gallery...get in that.",
"it can be a little slow, and it dowload other apps for this app with promision",
This app helps my lifs connect without others. Thr no bullying policy is amazing too! Must install.,
My kid cannot text her friend and they love talking please fix this there is no other way they can talk and she did not block her,
It's great for my kids the love it and the mini games a cute just love it,

It is so good and it is just like texting your friends and family.üòÄ,
The best and I always get to call my friend Lisa and I love to app and I wish you can never stop,
I love how you can text your friends and I am only 9 and I have been using this for a year,
I love the fact that I can text and video call but I'm not able to send any gifs,
My kids can talk to there friends inline without video games witch is amazing!!,
I like it but the password is right but it says the password is wrong that's why I gave 1 star only and I'm so sorry it's time to delete Messenger Kids.,
Great && safe texting and video app for all ages of children. Ky five yr old can use it veey well at this age,
My keyboard keeps on lagging. On Android this app socks but works very well on Apple,
Its a very great app i can text my friend anytime and i love its fun it's good this app exists :D,
An excellent way to stay in touch with your little ones! My daughter loves it!,
It is the worst app of calling because my friend can't hear me and i cant hear them,
4. Devs or Facebook ADD GAMES. You need games and add the fact that if you reinstall it and it keeps you signed in,
Stuffs my media volume up after every call. Have to reset phone each time,
its not working i tried to clik on the app but it gliches off i have a iphone and the app is on thar but than it stopd working please fix it,
Purrfect to talk to friends be friends with Vanessa Barnes you can see my best friend she gives out free iPhones she also watches it with the clean thingy that you clean for phones have to be on Facebook to do,
This app is great I can talk to all my friends and do funny faces,
it worked fine but every once in a while it won't work like it won't even open.,
i think it is a good app but i don't think it is safe my kid talks to a strange parson he calls him the man do not let your kid get new user's you don't know tell them about tat Parsons be safe,
The reason why I gave it a 5 star I can talk to my family and my Friends and it is really easy to get in and you block mean people and you can face time with them,
"Its..okay,I tried to get an account but it needed a fb account,the whole point of me getting this app is so that I dont have to use a fb account,this is pretty stupid if I do say so myself, it's a 1 star from me.",
My son is 9yrs old. I'm satisfied with the app as parents I feel that my son is secured and I can manage and see what he's doing what is happening....,
I love it but needs more faces for the kids to play with as the ather messenger,
I love that she can't request other people without my approval. However I can't add her mother or father because they are not on my FB friends list. Why,
When I'm talking to my friend to text some won't send and then it glitches,
love love love!! safe and secure! I know all the details!,
Amazing it's good to talk to your friends no interpretations I. The app,
i love this app it lets me text my family and freinds and the games and filters are so cool!,
The interface and security measures so far are good üëç parent know exactly who to add and monitor what their children are doing on the app.,
This is a really good app i use it all the time my friends and I use this app almost everyday its soooo awesome!,
"won't let me log into facebook. Very, very frustrating to say the least!",
My kids love it. It's safe as they can't add anyone without my permission or open a link without my permission,
Its an amazing app but there's just 1 thing IT goes on sleep mode at 8:00 all the time,
I lost video 1st. Uninstalled and can not re install the app..... please fix,
I actually haven't downloaded this game yet it's still loading but I don't know what it's like it's taking so long to download in my internet is still here so I'm wondering how good this is and my friend is going to call me right now so I have to hurry up and download this but somebody tell me is this game good or bad because I need more space and I don't want to just use this just because it's there,
My daughter has to text her friends on my phone and she really likes it when she uses Messenger kids.,
Love it I love everything of it the details the talking to your friends texting to your friends I just love it download it now,
I LOVE IT but every time I want to play a game with my SUPER BESTE it says she is not ready so I can't play,
I think it is ok because its a little bit to colorful but on the other hand its good,
Had to make my kids new accounts and now they dont have the option to share a song and make little videos they are not happy.is this option no longer available for the kids to do??,
it is good but when you make it full screen the profile pictures get bigger,
I use this to talk to my friends and family it's really great and I love the drawing game,
It's fun to talk to friends if you dont get to see them and when you dont got their number,
I like this app because if your parents wont let you use messanger then get messanger kids and its also super easy to use,
Great app for my aon and his cousins/friends can all keep in touch and talkkng! ü•∞ü•∞,
This is great for my son to use to keep in touch with his friends from school. I love the security.,
it works as a good app for little children ages three to five it's an opinion so I really believe it,

This app is perfect for People that live on the other side of the world that want to talk with their friends.,
I like this because little kids can texted there friends and video call and cool games and fitters üòÉüòÉ,
"Very nice, but lags a lot and does not respond on my chromebook",

Ok I am a kid and gess how I got my Google account I lied about my age I'm 11 but Google thinks I'm 20 this app will not let you delete messages or talk off speaker phone and it will not let you turn off video chat so the sucks it's not a kids calling and texting app it's a stupid video chat app that you can not delete messages my 5 year old sister send my mom a lot of messages on my phone and don't want a text full of emojis on my chat history but it has to be there because my sister sent it.,
Great app for me kids and great app to catch best friend liars that never want to talk to you like what happened to me thx app,
Ok good app but I can't use bluetooth while calling someone please fix that but that all,
It's fun and amazing for kids and parents. Kids will never have to ask there parents to call someone ever again,
Why can I not use a gallery photo for my kids profile picture on Android? Fix this ASAP since it clearly works on IOS,
Awesome app reccomend this for anybody who wants to talk to family members or friends.,

"Still learning how to use it, not as good at this as younger kids and people are.",

Amazing game you can play games you can draw you can do every thing i love it,
Not a simple setup. Hard to finish.,
honestly the app is good but everytime I want to make an account for my child it will say account failier,
Horrible it won't let me log into his profile from a different device it makes me create a new one every time,
This app is very cute for the kids to talk to one another!!!,
Its a really fun app because you can talk to your friends and play funny games i would definitely give a 5 star rating if i were you,
kids messenger is nice but it would be better if it didi not need wifi so if you wanted o text your parents or friends when you have no wifi then you cant text them but if you have wifi you wont need to worry,
"U Actually need to keep the saying for ALL the devices to have messenger kids cuz it only showed phone for mine and i am trying to download messenger kids on my laptop but it is not working cuz i can only do it on phone üò≠,But still Good appüôÇ",

"The update did not help, it only made me restart messenger kids. Please fix this, my mom's email isn't even working",
its a really good app on ipads and phones but not chromeOS bc its really laggy,
Pretty good for my son. Wish it had the chat head feature like the regular messenger.,

It's a safe way for my daughter to chat with family and friends I set everything.,
Good but my kids messages to her friend are not going through and it says failed but when they message me it works,
It allows me to be able to text with my friends without needing iMessage! Download messenger kids!!,
My kids are having so much fun with contacting with all their family during this time.,
"Awesome app, great to see what or who kids are in contact with.",
"It hasnt given me a hard time ever. exept for one time, i went in to messenger kids and it logged me out. can you guys fix that?",

"Amazing filters, great for kids, easy to use",
Dissatisfied...funny my facebook password will open my account but not when needed for this app and cannot connect for help...funny huh??,
This is actually really good I just got it so I can text my sister cuz she's only on messenger kids and it's really good,
I am a kid age of 13 but my mom makes me use kids messenger I enjoy he app but they should make it where you don't have a code you just send the parent a name and they can add them if they want to but overall this is a good app,
"I like this app because, I get to talk to my friends and family during this time, and when they live far away.",

Good to messege but new chat colors wont work on chrome. :[,
"Love that it gives the kids a way to stay connected, but still keeps parents in control of who they can connect to.",
This app has no trouble like the ratings although it takes alot of storage but another way its great,
I like how I can call my friends and then I can play Roblox with them without talking in the chat on Roblox but sometimes when my friend Charlotte does not want to play what I want to play on Roblox she hangs up the call,
Kinda not even good i dont get text notifications but fun and epic please fix,
I'd like to be able to add a parent without having to add them as a friend.,
I love this app. It lets me talk to all my realatieves and friends without feeling not safe. onelll I? )llmllll ONE thing though! I cannot open the app anymore and I really hope you work this out! PLEASE DOO,

My son can talk to his grandparents when ever he wants + friends he loves this app,
its so fun get now edit. one year later u need too put more colors bc i like too change the colors,

good way for kids to communicate and have fun. the parent is in control of whom they are talking with.,

Not stable it is slow and restarts for no reason,
Great way to allow your kids to talk to nessage their friends but you have access on what they are doing.,
"It's really kid friendly, and perfect for kids all ages",
Its a realy good app but you need wifi to text which is kind of dumb.,
Won't download properly. When it did it glitched out.,
Good for kids to talk to there friends and the best thing is it's parent controlled so you can know when then on messenger at all times,
For me this is so fun so if you have friends across the world you could still speak to them and the filters are so good I love them I love them like they're my dog,
I like it but sometimes you can't hear the person you are talking to and the other person looks Pixley,
so far so good the only thing is I meant to put bug instead of bud and I don't know how to edit it,
It sucks I was texting on it and then it stopped and said unable to send,
I like the app but I wish there was an option to read the messages.,
Awesome! I can chat and video call any of my friends or family and it's just the safest way!,
"Messenger kids must be getting phased out. Since Christmas I've been trying to install this on my daughter's new tablet and nope! Cannot authorize, kicks me out of my own Facebook account over and over and over...I guess we can't use messenger kids anymore?? ü§∑",
It is really fun and I can tezt my friends whenever and it lets me know when they are online,
It is good but it doesn't let me pick a picture from my gallery for my profile picture.,
Hasn't been working in few weeks. Millions of us want answers why it keeps looping the Authorize device when we try and log in,

"Ok, this is a good app I'll give it 5 stars- even though the parents barely see the messages- because there's bad things going on cussing- bringing blm..... like yeah blm- but please this is a kid app...",
I feel like this app should be able to zoom in in the editor.,
This app is rubbish it doesn't let you even log into your account or somthing don't download waste of time,
Parent-child friendly. Easy to navigate.,
Very fun and no inappropriate content no ads and can draw and ask questions,
"Because it is safe for, kids and you can talk to your friends and family anywhere and any time you can do fun games to",

Its a great app for kids to stay in touch with there friends,
I love this app I am a child who loves to talk to my friends and family so I use this app a lot,

So much fun because it is a because it is a lots of fun to talk to your friends and that's all I have to say so,

I like it because I can see on my phone who ever she talks to and I can see the conversation,
i love this app. It is good when I can't go to school and I can text my friends,
It helps you talk to friends but they change the effects alot!!!,
great idea and i think a big step into opening the world up so that their little minds can soak up different cultures. So that when they are older they want be so hateful and racist as past generation. Everybody sign ya kids up so that they can reach out to each other. we got to teach them its ok to be different.,
It is great for kids to text with friends and family,
Its a nice app and all but i hate that you cant see all of your contacts so you cant talk to everyone,
Can't get the video to work for video calls,
Awesome for texting friends without a adult app. Do recommend üëå,

I love it because its like real messenger but better and for kids thank you so much developers.,
Cannot get through. It keeps on asking for a password. Nothing happens. It always bring me there. How do you use this?,
Parents should be able to delete chat conversations from their child's messenger account. This app will not let you delete conversations unless you delete the contact/friend.,
"It is so fun for Jaylee, it has games, and lots of kid things, great!",
this might just be a tablet problem but I was. trying to go on to messenger kids but it would keep going off on me so yeah not using it anymore,
This is the best game for kids and other kids so they can drawing clothing teen,
Its an amazing app for kids who love to chat with friends or family,
it's cute but the lick sign and the color is not changeable :(,
This is a great app I do think it needs better facetime ability,
It's super great but I do not like when your internet goes away and it does a beepy thing,
Great way for kids to talk. I have a code and have to approve anyone who has my kid's code before rhey can friend her. Feels pretty safe. My daughter loves that rhey can make groups for group chats wirh her classmates.,
A challenge to set up. Great way to be in touch!,
Great app for younger ones who want to communicate with there freinds,
"veey good app for kids, keep you in touch with your kids an is 100% safe.",
App is not working!!! Unable to login,

It's great at keeping her safe and allowing her to talk to our friends,
I love the app.. i can now contact with my kids with no worry of adding anyone i don't know,
I can not like the app because here is not delete option and choose photo from gallary and search friends and press adding botton,
this app has been a great way for my kids to chat with people but me to be able to make sure they are safe while doing so,
It's helpful especially during covid-19 because it's a way for me to get in touch with family,

"Hi! Yes, im a kid but gotta say this is great! Always call my friends and siblings/cousins and can you please make a Facebook Kids?? Thank you.",
I think this is the worst Game because when I signed in it said that it was the incorrect password.,
Love it better than messenger easier to contact love the reading and fun activity's ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,
It's a good app but it wouldn't let me unstall it at all on my computer and put a virus on it,
It's a good app for your kids because like if someone is trying to get in to your house your kid can call you and you can talk to you friends,
Its a great way for children to talk safely to there friends and perents control the account.,
Downloaded it and kept getting message that my Facebook account was not found.,
"I love the fact I can control who my kids are friends with, and that the kid(s) can't delete messages but I dont like that I cant delete messages from the parents account.",
Won't let me make an account!! I had both my parents try and the app won't work!! STUPID,
Login not working goes in a loop for account activation super annoying,
Great app for kids to chat with friends but tricky to find them,
Great way to communicate with the kids when they aren't old enough for a cell phone.,
I love this app but the thing is you can not send websites and facebook stuff is unavailable,
This app is amazing you can text your friends send play games with them you can call them !!,
I really like this app but i would like to send freinds videos from the internetüò¶,
Huge oversight! Kids can send photos/videos off their device and unlike normal messenger you can't delete it!,
Great app I can talk to my friends easily! Thank you for launching this app!,
It is a good app to use for kids but it is hard to find friends but it is still good,
Adding a friend is impossible . This thing sucks! So irritated. What is the problem??!!!!!!!!!!! üò°üò§üòñüò´üò≠ü§¨,
Love this app a good way to talk to your friends and send funny stuff,
Hoping it works if we both use the same phone for messages.,
Evertime me and my friends talk a beeping sound comes on and it hangs up ITS STUPID AND I HATE IT,
Amazing for chatting with friends but do not like wen it says I got a message even though i tried to call someone....,
The App is great! Know that it will ask you for your Facebook info but won't let them use your account!!,
I like the app but why do I have the old school controls still but my friend Maggie has the updates?,
It just doesnt work on bluetooth headphones or earbuds,
So i my child used to have it on her tablet but it broke do i gave her my old phone and since i didnt remember her old account i tried making her a new one but didn't work but my kid loved it before.,
"Well it did work great, then an update made it completly unfunctional.",
This is awesome! I get to talk to all my friends.Maybe there should be profiles of your pet that you can put on for yourself,
Love the app but remove healthy habits app also please add something that has all of the filters,
"This app is perfect, no problems happen unless i have no internet.",
U better do something about th8s crash i cant even text let alone call.plss fix it,
I love the app but some times my friends can not hear me on the call,
"Won't allow login. Loops back to ""account verify"" page.",
Its amazing! I Love it! Its safe for me bcuz a lot of people massege me and its creppy As hell. So i reccomend kids to use this app,
it is awesome to be able to call friends if the dont have a phone and if you dont have a phone,
Great experience. Giving you also the privilege to monitor who's in touch with your kids.. that's awesome!!!,
I'd like the app a lot like how you kid call people and stuff and then trade codes so no one else can find you and make funny pictures,
This app is amazing because you can text your family and friends.üòö,
"Can't download on kindle fire hd 10 that my daughter recieved, says its unavailable, please fix this!",
this sucks you cant even sign up i mean it puts you back at the start if you dont use the facebook password,
Awesome app with safeguards to give parents comfort their children can communicate safely...,
It's perfect except you can't send links üò≠üòî,
This app is really good. But the only thing is you cant add people from messenger not messenger kids. Like my dad is set up of my parent but i cant add my mum but my mum and dad are not facebook friends. Bummer.,
"""Send Failed. A security check is required to proceed"" No idea how to do the security check.",
"This is awesome apps for kids, I wish there should be facebook app for kids also",
I really like how my daughter can Facetime her friends and text them,
It's great however his phone doesn't ring when we are trying to contact him.,
Make it available on computer so my child can stop using my phone to spam people non stop thus causing the spam on my phone.,
"Fun, fun, fun! Helpful way to communicate when I'm away.",
No matter how much i try to look up a way to add family to my child's account they r not able to I cant find any info on why its not working Someone help please This app is ridiculously vague,
"Great for Parents to communicate with your child,very easy setup",
Fix your app. I can't login in to my kids profile it keeps kicking me back to login in......frustrating and my kids not happy,
i love this app! now i can finnaly video chat and text my friend without haveing to have minutes!,
Love that my daughter can message me and talk to me when I'm not home. Just wish you could control more and see who she was messaging and be able to read the messages,
App is not opening up. It closes after it opens.,
Um great app. But it won't let a profile picture.,
It's really cute to do stuff and have fun and you can play games call people whatever you want. So if you want you can send it your parents or your grandparents.,
I love this app it is good for kids to talk to there friends.,
It would be good if the same updates that iphones get was optional for a samsung,

"can't log in, something went wrong when creating an account",
It is a terrible app way too difficult to send and review messages,
This is a great idea but I hate that u have to have Facebook for it would be better just as messager app,
"March 25, 2021 So far so good. My granddaughter can stay in visual contact with her extended family..",
Everything is good except it needs you Facebook number or something and I don't even have Facebook!!,
There's a problem in notification There's no sound when i deliver message,

Yeay good kids playing in a what aap my kids love is games chish verry good on a kids centre.,
they said it's for kids safety it's actually not it wants to know information and email account so I hate this app and I would never ever tell my friends or anybody else to go on this app to talk to their kids,
I can't see messages when sent and sometimes when I send them they don't send I know they're on Wi-Fi cuz I usually send them to people that are in my house so don't say they might not have internet because I know they do cuz they're in the house,
Took over 2 hours to install.. and APP kept freezing up!!,
I love messenger kids. Messenger kids it's a great app. You can text and call your. Parents control the texts and everything.,
Fun. And I know my granddaughter is safe well still being able to talk to Papa.,
I get to talk to my friends on it and it's the best game in the world and I hope everyone who made this app have a merry Christmas to all of you and to my friends on messenger kids and all the other apps I have on my phone.,
Hard to connect kids without their parents as contacts. My kids would often call adults who may be busy.,
I downloaded this game and I made an account but the app says I am not allowed to get into the account but I'm the one who Made it.,
LOVE IT! We can message other kids we know pls make it more good love it!,
It's so good In this covid I'm a kid so STOP I got a YouTube channel also by the way of the app. The app is just like so good. Best app ever,
Text messages from your friends And you can facetime your friends.,
Best for my kid to talk to her and he friends and no adults can not get on so it is perfectly safe üëå,
its a good app but if you press not now on the code you never have a code and you can't get one,
Best app ever my daugther really enjoys this she can talk to her friends with no problemn,

It s a great texting app and you can text anyone that you know,
It's very good my daughter is 10 yrs and it gives her contact with family that lives out of state and she can even call me when I'm at work or out of town,
I can talk alot of my friends and I love the filters but it kinda needs more bit I still love it,
This app let's me add people and take people away if I do not want my child to talk to them it also let's me monitor my kids conversations with people and they can't talk to people without my permision,
its so fun that you can play games and talk to your friends thank you who made this! so good,
Put the filters in the normal messenger These are so good but yet they don't go cross app,
It is the best app I have ever used and seen I have so many different people and family and friends ‚ù§üíìüíóüíïüíñ‚ô•get this app it is the best,
This has been crucial for my daughter since quarantine and social distancing. Being an only child with no local cousins or kids in our neighborhood this has been her only way to socialize and interact with other kids.,
"I never actually used it but I am trying to download it and I can't, I tried to free up some space but it did not work, any suggestions?",
I downloaded it ages ago and it got me through covid knowing I could call them if I needed help.,
its good for the kids..also for takes pictures with the games for kids..good jobüëç,
Was a good app until this week. Logged my kids out and it won't let me log them back in.,
Its fine i just think its unfair that apple or IOS can get the share your song thing while android cant.,
I get Login Failed for my son's account and nothing works. Please help!,
Really easy to use and let's me keep in touch with family and friends.,
this is a pretty cool app for kids who want to text there friends,
I can text my friends and call them and we look funny if we have 1 of the filters on and my friend that i had when i was 4 has this so i can talk to her,
"Even though it's getting better, filtering is very difficult.",
I hate this app it always ends the call and never gives me a notification,
My kids love it. I'd like to get a notification when they are one since I share time with their father,
Could be a little easier to use for the ones who isn't tech savvy.,
its so fun i love chickenugget by the way but this game is realy fun!!!!!,
This is good app because if you Don t now the person you can block them from texting you,
Could add more fun stuff for them. Make adding ppl easier,
I love this I can add my friends and family üíñ if only there was a Facebook kids! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,
The app keeps logging me out every 2 months when i use it please fix this,
Awesome! I love that I can chat with my friends without any scams.,
Great. But I wish it had an easier way to add more than one child.,
Only ring keeping it from a 5 star is how difficult it is to add new friends if your not friends with the parents on Facebook,
I have been trying to log my kids in but it won't take my credentials! Keeps on making me log back in. Please look into this..........,
Love it but sometimes when im taking to someone and their i pad feeal and puts it back i or they get up side down. And i make me angry üò§üò§üò§,
To this app :) =üôÇ!!!!! Android users can't change their voiceü§°dumbü§°dumbü§°dumbü§°but APPLE USERS CAN IT'S RAC-never mind filters üòêmid ‚òπÔ∏èit's badüëéüëéüëé,

It is the best i can talk to my friends in ontario im in nova scotia it is the best and im 9 years old and since covid i could not talk to my school friends,
"Its trash how for some ""no"" reason you wont let me make an account. I have everything I need.. but then ""oh, something went wrong try again"" WHAT. NOTHING IS WRONG AND I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED THIS IS TRASH",
The games don't work when my child is on a call and other then that I love it,
My kid has lots of fun talking to her friends and family on here it great,
I love this app because you can talk to anyone ü§óüòá and there is no ads,
I like the stickers in the packs and beautiful camera with a nice app,
Its good but the notifications dont go off most of the time but other than that It is good,
It helps me chat with my friends and when when I am sad I can text them and they always cheer me up. And when my mom is gone I can text her and the rest of my family to!,

Sometimes it's a little glitchy but I haven't had any problems with it lately,
Very good app but the old messenger kids we were able to change our clor now we cant did you remove the color changing thing?,
It won't tell you when it needs updates and stuff but I really like it!!,
I can call and text all of my friends with this app and parents would like this cuz they choose who you get to talk to,
"Very confusing. Made me, a grandmother a child I was trying to connect with.",
"Extremely hard to f****** navigate, to set up and get going",
Is wonderful still misss my friend and get to see her I like it sooooooooooooooooooooo much is wonderful I do not have this app anymore. üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ü•∫üò©,
"Ok, I LOVE this app but im 12 and im only allowed messanger kids to communicate with my friends and family and its all little kids stuff. Can we please have some more mature filters for photos and can we have calling and not just facetime?? Im on android and i really want the updates that apple products have. All of my other friends have apple phones and i have android, and there is no cool updates. PLEASE! make all of these changes and make it fair for android users. Then it is a 5 ‚òÜ for me.",

Its really fun! You can play games and call your friends!üíñ,
"Great, I love that I can see who my kids are communicating with!",
It's cool but to download an update you have to delete one of your apps so That's why I have it a 4 star,
I have been trying to make my child an account and it always says account creation failure please fix I've tried and tried nothing works,
App not working just keeps loping asking parent to sign in tried on a tablet and a phone same thing,

"It's really good if your out and your children are at home, and you can see if their all right.",

Amazing it's so cool couse my bestie who lives across the country can talk to me and I can talk to her best app ever,
its great for kids to keep privite and talk to friends while there in a safe group chat,
Love the messenger for my daughter!! I like the controls very much! Very safe.,
Its so much fun and i play it all the time i also like that there are no adds i just love it,
It is not to good I had it for a long time but I accidentally logged out and it won't let me get back into my acc just write back when you can please,
great to get my kids to comunicate with there friends over lockdown its nice to see them interacting with others,
The best app to use for safe call parent have to approve and nothing bad could happen .,
It Won't Let Me Make A Group Chat Even Tho I Have Em As Friends. When I Click Creat Group Chat. It Just Shows White And Im On A Chrome SAMSUNG Please Fix It.,
my experience with kids messenger has been extraordinary. I have not been hacked by it.,
I love the app but whenever I ask my bro to get me my tablet he texted mean messages so I want something where I can either lock my messenger kids with a password only I know or make it so you can delete messages. I also sent a friend something I ment to send to my mom I want to delete,
this app is for kids you have to do an email and I don't have one I have a school account and it doesn t work,
my kids love this app they text there friends so im happt with this app (spanish) s√£ g≈∑√™√™ t√∫d yeah i dont have time for this bye 5 stars,
I hate how I can't just turn off the ringer for this app. Kids will call me all the time. Let me turn off the ringer.,
Only thing is is that on android you cant add music to videos,
This app tells you nothing. It doesn't tell you how once you get your grandchild on the thing how to get in to talk to him or anyting I've already downloaded the app I've already done everything and it keep saying that I haven't downloaded the ap and everything else this is stupid why don't you tell people what they're supposed to do.,
I'm a kid saying this and I can text my friends Only 9 I can text all my friends And I'm in covid in 2020 right now And My friends are nervous about covid so I can't hang out with them,
Honestly it is so good and it shows when you contacts are online,
It is very fun for her she talks to her cousin and there are cool minigames,
It's really great because I get to talk with my friends from school and summer camp!,
This app is so amazing! You definitely should get it! It only works if you parent or guardian has Facebook.,
It's great. I can now message my little brothers on a safe site that is parent approved a d its great!,
Wonderful way for children to stay connected in a safe and parentally advised zone.,
I like how you can add friends whenever you want and then like how you have your own mini code and then like you have little tasks that you can earn little badges and then is made for kids and then your parents can see who you text you add and I like it but one thing I do not like about messenger kids is that they do not support gif stickers so if you get this can you please upgrade that or make it possible so that gif can be possible to send your friends,
Very kid friendly and safe highly recommend for all concerned parents. (I'm 16 btw),
I like it cause your able to communicate with other people and make friends,
There's no more missions when I complete them but it's really good,
Awesome app for kids. I love it and I feel alot safer with this app!,
It's a great way for your kids to speak to their family or friends I personally love it.,
So difficult to add friends to my kids especially those friends who are not in messenger kids.,
Messenger kids is great I love to call my friends on here but one of my friends blocked me and we're still friends it randomly blocked me and now she can't unblock me. she's not geting my request on it and cannot get me back.,
It is not that great but it is good for texts it freeze too,
now i love this app it is just that it stops working sometime and is. annoying,
The app has the ability to tell you when your child blocks one of their friends on messenger. we went into kids messenger read through the thread one of our daughters friends were dropping f-bombs along with some other unpleasant Behavior which is why our daughter blocked them. Kids messenger has the ability to tell you that your child blocked somebody and it should alert you when foul language is being used on the app prior to that! The fact that does not is ridiculous. Uninstalling today,
It's a great app for monitoring who your kid(s) communicates with.,
it was perfect for me and mom.I could text friends and send fun silly pics super fun,
i did not like it because i had to redownload this app because i was not working so i deleted it and downloaded a other app it was not working its not like the app was sleeping but thats one star i rated,
I love the I also have a recommendation for something to a witch is a kids messenger page for kids to post appropriate pictures and videos,
Good app for kids to interact and socialize.,
I try to manage the account when it is sleeping and will not let me do so. Not very user friendly.,
I spent 4 hours trying to sign in why is this so complicated what if you don't have parents or a guardian what are you supposed to do I don't know I'm just confused never ever even look at this app it's so bad it gave me a headache and I hate it and I wish I could give it 0,
its so good if u have a kid and u want them to have contact of there family insted of getting them a real account on messanger,
Helpful information about the program,
Best app for children to text there friends and family,
It's a great app for kids and this is a app me and my family can talk on and that's coming from a kid,

Lost my old Facebook account. Set up a new account now I can't even setup this again. Tired multiple times and get bre same message. Please try again later. Why?,
"This is a great app! I like how its for kids, and it keeps kids safe.",
"Account creation failure. I am unable to create an account for my child, I successfully created one for my one child but not for my other child. I have tried using my credentials and my wife's credentials on different devices and I am still unable to create an account",

I would give it zero stars if that was possible. You cannot log in!! It will not go past authorize device.,

Do you guys have a simpler kids messenger app so they can just video chat and not play games? I wish I could control more things like what she can and cannot use.,

It is really fun for my kid to talk to her friends!,
"I was shocked to see that all adults' emojis, including red lips, kissing, gays, and lesbians, are here, too. Please try to put more effort to keep this app as far from such concepts as possible.",
I think this app will be helpful for me and my son to communicate with while he is away from me.,

This app is so amaezing. I wish they had a app like this for our parents. That will be so cool and fun for our parents.,

Kids can video chat people and that is good because in case of emergency and you need to be face-to-face with somebody and your kid can't drive so you can just video chat the person you need to call,
I think that it is a great app but you can not send links,
"Honestly it's so good it's better than most kid messaging apps,",

How do I remove messenger kids from my phone as a 'parent' I set this up for my boyfriends daughter and we have since broke up and he won't let me have contact with her. Seeing her name on my contacts and getting fb notifications about messenger kids is heartbreaking. I just want to delete it. Please help!,
Its an awesome app for when yours kids want to call. Its safe because you and everybody else has a code and if you kids or kid want to call a friend from school they could just ask for their code and you kid has to know their code to add them and they dont know a strangers code so they will be safe!,
Very good app..... - Uzi Doorman,
i really like this app because it gives me contact with family members and stuff!,
IF someone send ro many photos you cant text them it resets the app,

"It's okay, Sometimes it does not let me call people but when it does it's a great app",
"this app is awsome i can talk to friend""s and all kinds of fun i recamend getting this app your mom has to put her facebook email and password but your mom has to approve the person that is asking",
O it's so good I could talk to all my friends who doesn't her friends phone numbers,
I love ‚ù§ it and all the games but I would like a cooler üòé area or whatever it's called,
I've tried to use my Facebook password 12 times still doesn't work. Absolutely rubbish,
This app is perfect! I am a kid and I cant get snapchat or stuff like this so my mom recommended this and it is great!,
Not good ilog in my acc and it's keep sayingg enter password I try again multiple times and nothing happened,
I heard you can use this app good and turns out you can!! It helped me talk to my ibf!! üòÅ,
I don't have a child & it signed me up with 1 when I just wanted to communicate with my young granddaughter.,
The temporary password app part of the thing messed up and I kept doing the password over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and it didn't work this app is dumb stupid and do not buy this app or get this app,
This app is great!I can add all of my friends and talk to them now!!!,
Best for talking to friends you can play with them too!,
easy and fun and funny and kids love it,
Can't sign up. Account creation failure and no fix,
I think that you should be able to do a lot more stuff on here that grown-ups can do like avatars etcetera,
Great for my kids to talk to their aunties and uncles! Simple and easy to use.,
"Not working, alot of people are having the same issues",
Best app for kids to talk to family and friends,
It doesn't work I had to log in for a whole hour so this app sucks so bad,
So me and my friend we are mad because you took out all the good filters there's only one game and those filters like üòç don't even work me and her want to know why you took them out. So please fix this,
My friend keeps spam calling me just to play fortnite with me and loged out of my acount by axcident and I could get back in.,

Great app the kiddos can get in touch with family & friends,
I love‚ù§ This app but you need to let the updates happen on android and not only apple because everyone else has an update that is awsome but android does notüôÑü§î,
I love this if I didn't have this I would never be able to text and call my BFF!üòÅ,
The app is forceing me to use my bussniess account for my son's profile. Despite the fact i put in multiple time my personal information.,
i would give it a 9/10 because on a Chromebook you cant FaceTime,
This thing won't let my child make an account you know how sometimes your child has the same name as you well that's whats going on with my child so I would rate this a 1 star it just dumb that it's not letting me make an account for my child,
This is a okay app it glitches sometimes and u have to have internet to use it so fix these things please,
"Very hard for a non-child family member yo accept a family request, even if the request has come from the parent (my daughter)!",
This was so good my kids love all of the fun games and faces they call it kids snapchat.,
I love this app I don't care if this app doesn't work sometimes this was the first app I ever used when I was 5 yrs I still use it sometimes especially even if I'm 10 yrs now,
Wrost app ever! I don't have a Facebook account so I can't have a safe thing for my kids! I don't believe I need Facebook so I don't have it. I know that they are making sure I am a parent but I know kids doesn't have Facebook so we are adults!,

I love this app. Now I can keep in contact with my grandchildren all the time. Thank you!,

I love this app im on my moms account but im 9 i love this app so much i saw a review that said terrable app and it said maybe it's because I'm 12 and this app is for like 5 year olds but ya. I seriously love this app:) :),
"Doesn't work, log in 1000x still doesn't work. Wth is that!",

Unable to authenticate. Loops back to parental login credentials,
Fun I can call text and FaceTime on Messenger kids is the best app I have,
Same as all the other complaints. Won't let me authorize device to fully sign in.,
"Used to be good and it still, is until I cant add any effects but everyone else can.",
"It's my chance to reveal the truth. The truth is..... This is a best idea of Facebook it actually works better than Messenger (Just our opinion - kids) it's the best chatting app for us (kids) for the parents who are strict, then install this app maybe you don't need to be strict to your children because this app is 100% safe and it's 100% for kids!! Please install this app just for the safety of your kids. Instead of saying that ""Messenger is more safe than everything"", just install!",
It's a very good app my daughter uses it all the time you get free everything,
Set it up gave it all my codes and email says wrong. I have no patience for bull.,
same as everyone else. got a new phone and my daughter and I can't get kids messenger on it because it won't get past authorize account -__- still works on 2 of her sisters accounts..,
"I just want to talk with my grandchildren and the app wants me create him an account on my devices!!! Very frustrating,",
"Useless app, takes wayyy too long to set up. Would not recommend!",
I love this game but what I have to tell you is that I left this game cuz I had to stay the nightmares to the time at my grandma's house and when that happens I can contact my mom and dad so that was pretty fine,
Honestly i have been using this app for a year and its been a really great experience.,
Really good for kids but we need more fun stuff on the 4 stars,
It's perfect for my kids to call there family and friends!,
It is a great app to talk to your friends to and play fun games the good thing about this app is the parents can see what their kids is doing making sure that they are not bullying othersüòÄüëç,
Login fails every time. Utterly useless.,
"I like it, I just wish that there were more color choises for both genders and you could change your name! That is what kids want to I give it a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",
"Not parent friendly, easy to get confused and make mistakes.",
After I set this up for my daughter she got her first oncoming call from her aunty and freaked out. üòÇüòÇ I should have shown her how it worked. It's great that I can control who adds her and who chats to her.,
It's fun for kids like me you can call and do a lot of fun stuff,
"A little glitchy, also can't take videos.",
Whenever i go to play Minecraft or Roblox its always flashing black to the screen over and over again,
It's great to connect to your friends in lock down,
I love how the parents have access to anything you or your friends send on messenger kids and it's got fun activities and filters for the children.,
so uh its nice but when u try to call when they r on the phone its kida boring to wait for them to call back üò≠,
Facebook and messenger doesn't seem secure. A lot of hacking and scam messages,
It is amazing i use this to video call and text my friend good app for kids two,
I love this app you can message all your friends and family,
"Downloaded and when setting up, it says not available on my region. :(",
I love this app because you can actually face time and it is so so so safe for parents and kids,
have tried MULTIPLE times to create accounts for my kids and it keeps saying FAILED try again later... so annoying üôÑ,
its a really good app but i wish u could delete messages on it :(,
"It won't let me log into my account, and for some reason when I open it it says logging out",
Want to remove this app but can't yet shows on Facebook. Frustrating,
my kid is not able to get in to her acount. Sleep mode is not a this time but it says it is on sleep mode.,
My kids are able to contact me when they're home alone and they talk while playing online games with friends and I'm able to see what they're up to and only approved people can talk to them,
It's amazing but you just can normal call all you can do is face time,
The basketball game in the pet menu is not working,
An option for adding an additional parent would be great,
i haved used it a lot and its very fun not having to use my moms phone to text my bff who has been sick for a long time but is now better;),
It's fun and its pretty easy to communicate.,
It would call people while i was texting it was aggravating,
it is Very good for my child so she can learn how to write she is 11,
"You get to see your friends even if their far away, even during pandemic!",

App keeps sending me in circles when trying to authorize sign in. Please fix,
Why can't I add my daughters father as a parent? We are not friends on facebook for privacy reasons but I do want him to manage our daughters messenger account and be able to chat with her.,
This is a very good app bc if u have okay internet u can send and get msgs super fast,
My son loves this and he doesn't have to have a Facebook account to have this app. So I'm very happy.,
"Parents Don't really Have control.Facebook Does! Won't let you add family members if Facebook deems then to be not approved based on community standards. Also keeps a history of EVERYTHING, including pics and chats, that your child sends and receives just like it does in your account! Download your file sometime! Stick with signal or discord secure messaging!",
it's really good I can text or call really easy,
Such a good app all though I wish that the decorate option was back,
It doesn't even let me sign in but when I close the app and try again it says logged out,
my little human loves to be able to keep contact with family. it helps make sure I know who she is talking to.,
"I'm not sure if I did something wrong but it won't allow me to make an account to talk to my little cousin. My cousin enjoys it, so I'll give it 2 stars, but it's unfortunate that we cannot communicate.",

Because my friend Evelyn has it and when it was summer I watched on it and it and it looked fun even though I don't have it set it up yet but I'm asking my nanny to because you can text your friends and all of your family members and you can call them but you only can call them when you have internet and you need to call them and ask them first like this nanny can I call you please is if they go to walk you can get them in big trouble or you can get them fired from there job! IAM looking at the,

I think it's cool cause I can't have a reap Facebook but can still face. Time,
It said I did everything right but it failed to create an account no matter how many times I try not how long I wait,
It deserves zero stars. My 13 year old can't even have an account. It's always saying error.,
You should make a kite fly out of the side of your phone/tablet forü™Å and bubbles float up From bottom screen 4 üßº,
It is a great way to chat with my friends and family even when I am a long ways away from them.,
umm I can't even get this app to open from the play store once I installed it on my childs tablet please fix,
Every time that it says I have to log out I've deleted then put the app on again it's annoying,

I love this app it's so good I'm a kid and I love this so much I would recommend giving this to your kid or keep it for you but I would say this is a good app,

Please Fix‚Ä¶. The app wont work for android but will let us login just fine with our apple devices,
You can chat to people across the world And you can contact anyone if they have messenger kids. Though everybody getting an update except me sooo.,
I think this is the best kid friendly communication app,
This app is a texting app for you're kid and you can see everything that's said and pick the people you're kid is texting.,

It's a fun app how I get to chat with my friends in a kid friendly safe environment but none of the games in activity center work and I want to play bat grub,
My husband is a over the road truck driver. So my 10 year old daughter loves this app. To keep in touch with her daddy. ‚ô°,

I LOVE MESSENGER KIDS as a nine year old i had snapchat but was boring so my best friend told me to download this so i did now i can communicate with all my friends nomatter where they live and parents are in control so they can control who you talk to so it protects you from bad things i DEFINATLY reccomend,

App is really good so I can talk to my parents not my friends because all of them are unknown.,

"Is this going to be addressed?? Thanks.. It also requires the parents/guardians to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on Facebook, which could be awkward for separated families.",
Would like PC friendly version. Do not like my child needing my phone to use and not her laptop.,
The app never let me authorize. I was never able to use the app.,
It's really good app my daughter call her friends and play among us together,
It was fun to play and it made my day and I love it so muchthat's why I play it all the day that that's why I love it so much it's because it's the best thing I ever had in my life and it's the only thing I could text on and the only thing I could be good at and that could be the best thing I could ever have and I love reading books and I love reading a lots of things I live reading I love,
So the only part that was hard is that you have to tell every one you know and tell them to get it and set it up other than that it is the best and i love it and i call and text my family and friends,
its a good way to communicate and its fun for kids,
Great app for kids and i luv that i can see their texts,

This is an amazimg app. You can talk to anyone and it is safe.,
He's going to love his daddy so much getting him his own phone to talk to Daddy and Mommy an brothers and sister i love the parental guidelines,
"I have been using messenger for 3-4 years and I cant log in to my facebook account, even if the internet is okay",
Would be nice if we didn't have to use Facebook and we could just use our emails.,
"This app is really good for me so I can talk to my friends,but sometimes it's a bit slow but as I said it's still a great game üëèüëåüíì",
It's nice. Allows my kids to talk to grandparents and other kids that I approve of.,
The app is pretty good bc its safe for kids bc you need a parent to verify you and all the other filters pretty cool its safe for kids i would recommend this for kids and you can text with your friends if your parent verify and no strangers will tex you so thats why its 5-5 yall should get it and its free,
Won't let me login no matter what I do. My password is correct and I still cannot get in.,

It's the best app for kids and your child's friends,
Cannot log in and nowhere to get help. Trying to get someone's attention.,
I love this cuz I can call all my friends it fun you can take pictures and have fun,
Same repetitive login issue. Please fix!,
"Messenger kids is the best chat app for kids. It have chats calls games and my favorite game is ""grow your pet""that app is so safe and great for us!",

Amazing app I can text all my family & friends on there,

It was good to have something for my kids to see their friends and family cousins and everything else,
Great way for kids to safely communicate with people within their safety circle.. My 10 year old loves it!,
I like it but when ur friend send u a pic it downloading alot and it does not show the picture,
it is amazing but soon it gets kinda glichy but it still works totally get it,
i cant see half of my contacts and it looks like there is a phone on my chromebook/computer,
There are some features only accessible in Apple version,
I can talk all day with my very close friends and its only in a click,
"I can't even CREATE the account! Tells me ""Account creation failure. Something went wrong. Please try again.""!",
this is great for my son he loves having his own messager instead of using mine all the time,
I love this app i can talk to my old friends its the best!,
I like this game and is like messengers but for kids is safe for kids and you don't need a phone number I gave it 5 star's you should install it :),
"Great way for kids to communicate and still be safe, knowing who they talk to and only approved people can contact the kids",
Wouldn't let me log in after I logged out but overall it's a good app great for kids,
I like this app so then I can keep up with my friends and talk to family members.,
there should be a way to change the picture without always having to take a new one,
i love it so much it helped me conect with my dad witch literly lives 20 hours away ;-; and i found out i will see him in about 3-4 months,
That was so great . My child is so very much enjoy taking a pic,
I think it's awesome my kids really like it and I give it a 5-star rating it's really great,
I don't like that I can't get into the conversation the kids are having. Other wise I like it.,
love it since i live in Ind. it is heard to keep in tuch so we use's this app because the rest of the fam. lives in Ohio,
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa we are going to do a few more hours of work and I have to go to the store everyone else is the picture to show up for work so you almost here yet even I don't have a lot of work to send that to everyone for us to do a lot to do in order to send that plays out of town for the next I'd love for like a month and a picture to show up at your place at the same time as the derum I am not sure what the derum I don't think we will do the needful,
It is really good bc you could talk to friends and family and I love it,
It does not let me log in to my account to confirm my childs account it says my account does not exist i even deleted her account to see if that was the problem but ugh this sucks ots annoying.,
It won't let me update it and it kicks me out every 30 seconds I need help,
Best app ever I loved it so much I can finally contact my friends and also it's fun games to play,
I think this app is very helpful and keeps the childern safe.,
Thanks for the app because I can call my friends. I love your app but it is not working on the iPhone 4s can you help me to get the manger kids on the iPhone 4s? I love the app thank you üòä‚ò∫üíï‚ù§,
I installed it but it shows my daughters account and not mine. Worthless app!,
I like Messenger for kids because u can text ur friends if they have it and u can draw and facetime ur mom or others that u add and you can text a d it works like the messenger for adults üòÇüôè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®,
"Fun and easy to use, no ads!",

I say 3 because it took forever to download but over all i love it!,
Awesome idea...Great for the kids...now they can see each other whenever they want.,
I cant even get on the app it keep saying try again i tryed all three of my facebook acounts,
This gives me so much joy. To talk to my grandchildren at their level. Love this app,
Terrable it has to have Facebook enabled but I don't like Facebook.,
It was fun I can talk to my friends and family.And you can make the group's as big as you want.,
It help me. Wit my lil siblings so I can make sure there on track and there doin good!!,
its good but it uses so much storage and for ppl like me who only have 6 gb its kinda anoying,
"Developers broke the app and can't fix it, apparently.",
This app is basically Spyware for parents to use on their kids. I would just use regular messenger or discord etc.,
I love this app it's really great for kids! Good job messenger!,
Im just so glad and greatful that i can text my friends during corona,
Great for helping to watch kids and their messages to others and great at making sure we feel safe as parents.,
I am wanting my 14 year old daughter to use this because it is alot better than instragram and doesn't have the 40 year old weirdos. Is this like 10-18 years old,
"I put in all the information, and it didn't work, and yes it was valid",
Broken app. Just cycles in a loop.,
"My kiddo loves being able to talk with cousins, grandparents and friends that have moved!",
this app is fun like messenger but for kids amazing for your children I highley recomend this for ages 4-19,
Will not work on my devices. Have updated all of them and it will not activate my son's account.,
"Just get ""user is not allowed to log into app"" with valid parent credentials",
"It doesn't work, none if the links to add people or get a code to add people will work so what is the point of it?",
I can text with my friends and call them and there are no adds,
3 stars only because it takes lots of my space on my phone also glitches my phone and I'm mad no really!!!!!!! ]:<,
Great for kids and I like they can send messages to us.,
Great way to communicate during the covid19 situation!,
in the future is they're going to be option to delete group chats. my boys created a few and wanting to downsize but no option to delete or remove people from the chat that was created through kids messenger.,
Crashes right away on my children's chromebooks. Doesn't work.,
it glitches on u u cant hear barley after a wihile it does not glitch you can hear on it,
Won't let me authorize a new device. Terrible loop of logging in and out,
kid friendly love this app very easy to use! highly recommend,
I love it! I can text anyone who my parents set up for me. I can have group chats and group calling as well as group video chats.,
It will not let me sign in says it sent a password but nowhere to be found and will not accept mine,
I love this app because kids can talk to there friends from a distance,
So fun I like it you can go anywhere that you want I like to call my best friends on this app and it's so cool so hope you have a fun day I love this app because you can call a bunch of people I can even come with my dad and my sister and a whole bunch of people and I love I love to be on this app,
Sorry phone got factory reseted and I don't have Messanger Kids on there anymore. :(,
My daughter's friends can send stickers and gifs but she can't. Why?,
"Amazing app, very helpfull and safe for kids!",
I love just texting my family and friends when i need help or if it is a emergency i will text them so they can help me if there is a problem,
"Can't login, I put in my username and password and all it does is go back to the same screen over and over",
I like this app but why do you HAVE to have Facebook for your kid to talk to their friends,
This app is absolutely great but the account thing other people do not have an account,
I love it. You can talk to all your friends in a group chat. I LOVE it,
I talk to my 3 great grands every single day and their great Nana just loves it. These little people make my day and so love communicating with them.,
its great to talk to friends and family but you only can do face time,
Is there a way to change the messaging background color for this like how we can as adults on messenger?,
Message kids is the best game well it's not a game it's just a messaging app for kids,
Perfect solution to quarantine kids and end of school too soon blues! Thanks,
This is a amazing app for kids so.. i think we should have facebook kids like if you agree,

I love this app I can call and text and if I'm bored I can get on this app and play some games I love it soooooo much,
Love the app it's great and my sister can talk to her friends,
The reason why I only put four stars because every single time it's so blurry to hear my cousins on one of my family members to hear I always have to say huh hahaha,
this is a amazing app the part i loved was if you are on a device you can use the same account on another device,
App has been fixed. Uninstall and then reinstall,
I can allow see the other person in video chats. I can't hear them and they can't see or hear me.,
Really needs a alternative to verification other than Facebook not everyone uses Facebook,
The app is perfect no glitches and no ads,
good app for kids because not all kids have the real texting app;),
"Needs a regular call option, not just video call",
Love this app.but i have a contacted kori k and she is veey annoying. So if im not on the app plz block her calls,

I love the app it is so much fun but it won't update for me so I would really love if it would update,

No adds you can text your family and friends anytime and NO inappropriate stuff.,
its fun but its hard at the same time.,
I like it but needs to update photo filters more often,
"I have it on my phone now, so that means i finally have the new update, im 10 now, and i think snapchat is better bc all of my friends are getting that",
"Its amazing,I works so well! download this messenger kids app.ITS AWESOME!",
I love this app my kids can have fun and text me this app is great,
With the new update you took away the grow pet?! My daughter worked so hard on that for a week straight! BRING IT BACK. And if you refuse to give feedback on the problems it is having I will report your app to authorities.,

Amazing app I love all the details as a kid myself :),
"Horrible, I logged out and tried to log back in and now I can't >:( .",
i got this app for my lil sis and i hate that you have to have a facebook account to do it.i would give it more stars if you could use other social media account to do the app,
The best app for all kids and and top of that iTS FREE!,
I love how I can chat with other people the only thing I don't like is that for some reason now I cant chat to anyone I send a message to for no reason even though I'm online,
I love this that I can talk to my friends if they're like if I'm going to lucedale Alabama if I'm anywhere I can talk to them it's so nice I love this app it never gets old,

I can't even make an account for my child which after sifting through Google for a solution this seems to be a common problem for a lot of people.,
i like it beacuse you can talk to people and its one of my favrite apps in the world,
Its good and let's u talk to ur freinds whenever but I do think they should let u know if ur freind is chatting with someone else so u don't interrupt there call,
What happens if people don't have Facebook one of my friend's parents doesn't have Facebook and now how am I supposed to chat to them I would say zero stars but I have to give at least one star to be able to write a message,
Easy to use and great to communicated,

Great app it helps my son keep contact with his friends during the shelter in place,
Can't send my granddaughter images or receiving images from her. Her mother has the same problem. So does her Grandpa :( Pretty pointless. Will stick with texting.,

I think it's amazing just be careful of strangers they are a lot of creeps in the world do be careful,
I downloaded this app for my daughter so she can message her grandma's and her cousins. She loves being able to message them and video chat with them,
i sucked when you get in you need a face book account for a child to use it like really bro I hate that cuz I don't even have Facebook so it's a bummer I had to uninstall it,
I like to call my friends on it. I do wish there was a way to just voice chat though.,
Good for texting and having fun(for kids),
It's not activating it's showing something went wrong..I'm so sad abt tht..ü•∫,

"Over complicated garbage, can't even comprehend why they have to make its so difficult....",
Great app.You can manage your child's messenger.What I like here os that you will get notified in all of his/her activities in group chat.,
messenger kids is the best app ever you should download and you should rate it becuse you can text your family members rate if you like it.,

Being able to talk to my friends while at home after school is awesome the games are cool,
I love this app but it is keep glitching and it dose it all the time.,
"well made, and reports when your kids are acting up and sending nonkid friendly things.",
Has anyone figured how how to login when it asked to autherize the device and won't accept the password?,
It's cool and fun but you cant really play that many games,
"I thought this would be great for my daughter to be able to send me, her father and brother messages. It won't even load. Don't waste your time with this.",
I tried to get on messenger kid it did not work we tried to make up an account that said account creation failure we kept on doing it over and over again it kept on saying account creation failure over and over please get that fixed,
Please add in being able to save videos on the text update,

I love it. For a 12 that i am. Its great. I can keep in touch with everyone. Thanks to all who helped make this. God bless u all,
This app is a little annoying because when I try to call someone it won't let me,
I think this app is awesome because I can text my parents in a much safer way,
Galaxy Tab A 8 won't allow us to press end a call or switch camera,
when someone sends me multiple photos it only lets me see the first photo out of the multiple and i dont know if its only happened to me or mamm others??,
it used to work. not anymore. it is stuck in sleep mode,
I love this app I have all my friends on here. It's so nice but I wish u could costumize ur freinds name,
Will not let me create an account for my cold at all in any device. Just keeps saying something went wrong,
There isn't a way to delete messages and FB doesn't respond to questions about it.,
My daughter loves this app its great for kids communication‚ù§,
I love this message it's good for me it's better then face book because face book has bad things that is why I like messenger kids,
"Love this app for my son to hangout, chat and play games with his cousin who doesn't live close by.",
Constant failure to even create an account. I've given up.,
Fun easy to use it for a kid mostly adapting,
"It's great and all, but you can't delete texts.",
W9nt let me authorize the account. Very frustrating. We've been trying for a week,
Its actually good but its lacking some feature like the original. Messenger,
"it wouldnt let me log in, i tried 3 diffrent facebook accounts but if wouldnt work",
"Very good, I can call my friends and this is a very safe app for me.",
It's so fun because every day you get to talk to your friends and it's just so fun,
This app keeps updating and then we can't get into it,
daughter's love this app but lately it just goes black and crashes,
Pretty good but I really want them to bring back the links for the adult account,
Cannot use Bluetooth headphones for call???,
I love the app,
"Can you please set a option called ""choose from gallery"" in the camera option please. It has the option in ios device not android so please can u do it. It would be very appreciated by android users if you do that.",
This app is cringe af,
Amazing decently recommend,
There's a bug where it won't send but it's how I contact my friends to good,
Help me communicate with family,
Good but fails to communicate overseas,
The best game for kids to be like their older faimaly members of texting,
It's awesome that I can finally communicate w my two kids w out salty baby momma doing all she can to distance me.,

Cant log on on my kids tablets since the spring (2022). It works on my phone but not their tablets- which was the whole point of them having messenger kids.,
"LOVE IT! My friend moved, but i can still talk to her!!",
"When I first went into it, it said I have to have a Facebook account. My parents don't have a Facebook account. Like seriously üôÑ. What happens then?!?",
Fix your notification system. I have this app so I can talk to my neice and nephew and I only get their messages days later? Why? I feel like a horrible aunt now thank you.,
I so love this ‚ù§Ô∏è for my 9year old I get to pick her friends and it's kid friendly.....,

I love it so much that after my phone got reset . I'm trying to download it,
Love it but wish we could exchange video links at least between parent and child,
"As a parent I'm trying to make my kid an account and it keeps telling me ""error"" like ???? I dont remember it being this hard to create an account pls fix!!!!",
"Fun for your kids, helps them to be busy, and makes them happy.",
Some times it doesn't let me send it to my friends and it doesn't let me call my friends.,
It would be good if u added some snap filters pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,
"Great way for kids to ease into social media. However, there should be a way for you to report bullying so kids that constantly cause problems can get kicked off. Kind of like how roblox does it.",
Love it! Allows the grandkids to communicate in a safe way!,
"Will not install. Will not accept my password, even when I change it and get a code. Been working on it for 3 days. Uggg",
It helps my kids talk to people that now and love and there friends well it help them to tell wut is going on to people that need to now so that is why I rated this.,
Its a good app yet no matter how good the internet is it always glithches.,
its so great learn to conect with friends and so much more,
My kids love it. I love it cause I can monitor it.,
Because the app stops working sbd i have to uninstall it and instal it back agian,
This is one of the best ways kids can texte,
"Wouldn't open, reinstalled a few times still nothing.",
I love this app I'm only 8 and I can call and text my friends and family,
I like it but now it says it is always in sleep mode and I can never talk to my friends about homework,
I really like it! But.. it has a little bit of games. I still really like it!,
It lets me talk to my friends and there are funny filters too!,
I have it on my iPad and phone it's amazing I love it. It's the best app ever,
This app isnt working and cantogin for awhile now. But u can install it. Ugh,
this app is stupid and to difficulte to download and get signed into I DONT RECOMEND THIS STUPID APP!!!!!!,
I have had it installed on my phone and i had reinstall it very aggravating,
Great for kiddos but confusing to find/add friends,
It is a good app beacause if you can't see your friends and family so you get messenger kids,
I like this app all though it says it is installed but it's not >:( I did not uninstall though. But otherwise its pretty cool,
I don't know much but after a while it shuts off and the prsin that vital it you need thir emaul,
Its really fun to call other people-theres games for when your calling too,
Now my kids can't log in. I authorized many times still won't let kids log in.,
I cant log in keeps saying its having a priblem with no option to fix it,
It's cool I guess,
Can't sign in. Logs in takes me back to the login screen,
This is great this will be helpful U text ur mom and friends that's awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è I like this app üòç,
It's ok. Just a minor glitch that says people are offline when they are online,
There should have more people on one chat so every one can see echo the at the same time.,
Its a great app but can't find anyone to chat with (like my granddaughter),
Constantly getting an error when trying to approve people for my child to talk to.,
I would like if you made it too were I don't black screen every second,
It's so cool that I can text my friends and family as a kid so it deserves 5 stars,
Very good and easy to use. Also very fun and cool,
It is so great and fantastic for kids üòò it is so great I can not explain it,

It's stupid why u have to have your Facebook email what if u dont have one and dont need one why cant we put our regular emails like.,
I love it! I can text my friends on it. So cool.,
I like bear cake but the problem is that there is a blank space and it does not have any cake,
I can call and text so many people it is amazing,
I love texting my friends on this app and using their creative filters,
"""I got a lot behind the music stops and get a good internet connection between them lose momentum and get a good internet connection between them lose momentum and get a good internet connection to be homeschool ed Miliband has a boyfriend and get a good internet filter""- Autocorrect",
"Very importent...funny apps,,,and so,,nice",
"I love this app, I can chat with all my friends and family! I give this app 5 starsüòÅüëç",
Horrible app won't let me log in and says unavailable don't get,
I like it because I can talk to my friends and I can talk to people and friends that are far far faaaaar away,
It's great for my kid Keep up the good work,
I think it's weird but not useful for kids if it doesn't make a Facebook account,
It was fun but now it glitches a lot,
"My son can only call his friends but it won't allow him to chat, it says ""unable to send"" with a yellow exlemation point.",
It's honestly a 0 out of 5 . Doesn't let you log in. Does t authorize device. Don't even bother .,
I don't like this app because you have to have facebook to use and I don't,
it is awesome i get to talk to my friend's and I'm 8 years old my uncle is roy Kelly guns and ammo. Ok i am now 11 years old and i found this review from when i was 8 and i habe realized how childish i used to be,
"very confusing and other people could create accounts for my kids, and I couldn't add myself to their account",
This is an awesome way for me & my daughter to comunicate when she is not near me.,
pls am trying to download the app but is taking long to download,
"The fact you can't unsend messages to other people in this is not ok,",
It's difficult for us to see when messages were sent,
I. An talk with allof my friends at the same fime and you. An make group texts it is soo fun,
I love the fact that my daughter can only talk to and interact with people that I approve of!,
This app was amazing for my little girl and her school friends ... #social distance,
I am having problems getting on the all I tried Uninstaller and reinstalling,
"Was trying to my little brother an account but it keeped on saying ""account creation failure"" even though everything i entered was correct",
the app wont open for an unknown reason and it is inacessible by anny other means,
I love that I can text my friends anytime on this app.,
I chose this rateting because some times it glitches alot otherwise its a good app,
"Trash, I can only get this cuz I'm only in 6th grade and it's very childish turn this into a messenger for kids bellow 10 make a new one for 10+ and ur parents dont need to see ur conversations I need privacy sometime",
My daughter can talk to her friends and family and there's a curfew so she can't chat at bed time.,
It's great but once I add someone he/she doesn't show up so yeah,
Its amazing I talk with my mom and dad when in lost and yeah its really cool,
"It needs my email, bit I forgot it! How about adding thst OFF.",
i tried to make my child a account but everytime it saws create account it keeps on saying: could not create childs account. Please help,
It's good but it doesn't have the best audio and camera.,
It's really good um ...it works and I look forward to using it when I get kids,
I love it its easy to use and the fillters are great,
I don't have friends and you just text with people in your phone üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,
such a great app! using it during COVID-19 is the best!,
"Like it! Simple, easy-to-use and I always know what's going on",
This app is isn't working for me cause it's say message didn't send,
Couldn't connect but it's not the apps fault I love using this on my kindle,
Ok. But on android you do not have the option to make your profile picture an image from your gallery you can only take a Selfie pls let me upload pictures from gallery to my profile pic Thank you,
Very good gets laggy at points but it works really well,

It drains your battery real fast which is kinda dumb but i still get to text my bff,
Can add second child. App keeps glitching,
I have the messanger kids app on my child ipad and now i dont know how to do it on a computer. But amazing app!!,
I have been texting my friends on this like every minute it sooo good,
It's ok but some times it's not like a video call or text I feel like there's a vires in messenger kids,
Video streaming doesn't work with Samsung Galaxy TAB SM-T355Y.,
My kid loves it and can always talk with friends and i she can be in her room while she talks to her friends,
takes up a lot of space and I can't hear any body clearly,
App won't even let me create the profile and can't find support anywhere,
I think this app is good for kids to interact with each other,
I really like calling friends and the filters make it so much funner,
I can not download it on my PC which sucks. Get it fixed.,
Crashes when trying to open app,
I appreciate that all friend request are approved by the parent. That way i know she's not speaking with someone i wouldn't want her to. Great job,
It's good but when in off too long it Uninstaller please fix that,
i love it honestly i can talk to ppl who i dont have there number i can play with fun filters one thing i wiwh thwy had were small lil games..,
It's a great way to communicate with your friends and family members ‚ù§!!!,
Downloaded app tried to add my child and it keeps saying something went wrong . Waste of time,
I would ricomend this app because you if is just like whatsapp just for younger kids.,
That you can text your friends and call your friends and you can draw pictures and that's why I like it,
I like the app but it logs me out at random times when I open the app Sometimes,
Excellent experience now we grandparent's can interreact more with kids feeling apart of the modern world üåé,
i love this app beacause bitb is so amazing the reson i gave it a 4 star tho is beacuase i with that we coukld add freinds without asking parents :/,
"You can have a message for Fun You are best thing ever What are you gonna pick It's time for some fun Oh we can have fun You can have so many stuff you can choose You can take 1,000,000 lights Or you can have so many messages You can do something that is so good Or you could do something that is so good or so bad You can have so many stuff that no 1 can stuff you You don't want no 1 to steal your things You can do something fun or bad 123 eyes on me That was the biggest score in the world Boo ??",
Messenger kids is an amazing way to communicate with friends and family I have not had any problems.,
Super fun to chat with friends and create groups,
It was sucky because maney some of us dont have Facebook and then we cant log in so maney y'all should change that,
I love it I can call my friends and everything but I have to update a lot,
"This app is good but Won't let us Remove Messages,, You guys should improve this",
It is very good and good quality pictures,
Great app kids can message their friends and send stickers!,
Its amazing for chating with friends and having a great laugh,
No ads and very easy to use,
I can't sign my child in because of some error I've tried my wife's account instead but It still doesn't work and I don't know why,
I wish I could give this a no-star Facebook yucky Facebook is the one place where people commit suicide and kill people it's disgusting but anyway why do you have to have Facebook to have messenger kids can't you just get Messenger kids and use your email for Gmail it doesn't make sense or even use your iCloud it doesn't make sense please please just can anyone use it cuz I tried to talk to my sister and I can't because I have to have Facebook and her mom has Facebook so she was able to get in,
I love the app but i cant download it cause i don't have enough space,
You can vidoe call your friends and things like that so i think its a pretty cool app,
"App was great, now I can't approve my daughters friend requests.",
That is amazing except for one thing group does not work,

Wish it was just an extension to the original app and not another application,
It's fun and all but like it takes for ever to lode but only my friends work but mine doesn't,
I find it doesn't work very well. It seems to take forever to do what it is supposed to do.,
Its good to contact people.But the video chat has no rightone.So it kinda sucks.,

Messenger kids is a great app for kids but the time of day is wrong,
"Every time I hit ""Install"",it says ""Could not Install Messenger Kids"". Please fix this bug.",
"I get to play lots of fun games, text my friends, and call them!",

I think that it helps kids communicate better,
"At least at the very least I can speak with my child that knows how to talk. Just enables my babies father to leave my son out of the fun. Like he hadn't already been talking since birth. Whata hazard this can be to parents with nassissic old moms and dads, plus silly old mommas that try to screw you out of the family. No trust really with them",

Its good but it is glichy plz fix the glichy ü•∫,

"Great idea, can not Express how much more I love the idea of this then my children having their own messenger. Call it invasive, intrusive nosey. Heck, call it whatever you want to, doesnt affect me in the slightest. Knowing that I have the upper hand in ensuring my kids are all the more safe is the most important duty I have and one I cannot allow myself to fail in. Truly, thank you guys for this one...",
my brother is traying to download the app in puerto rico and say not in there region please do something what to see them and the star will go up,

My daughter used this app and some of the word suggestions that come while you type were inappropriate,
"I hate it because my kids are smart and the parents control the app then what's the point of having it if the parents does stuff on the 1 star I would put 0 stars it I could give you kids regular messenger. My 2 daughters Stella,and Isabella are 9 I had twins but there responsible so treat your kids normally",

My kids can can contact me anytime and they feel more comfortable that they can see my face when speaking to me.,
I lost my account for my son after he closed da app,
Awful. Puts you in a loop trying to log into the device.,
I feel safe and secure with this app to allow my 10 year old to 'text' her cousins.,
i can text and call my bffs when ever i want....so it is the best app of all time,
This app is pretty good but it just started not letting me talk to my mom and it kicked me out of all the groups that im in that has my mom in it Until this gets fix 3 ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ but when it does 5-4‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ-‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Thank you,

Great way to have fun & interact with your kids or just the little kid inside you! Quite frankly I get a little bored of all the reparte if you will on face book these days it used to be fun & inspirational . genuine intent ! Keep that alive & truth & kids can smell it like little blood hounds ! Grown ups lose it when they accumulate motives with every action & every word they say! Just be real!üó£üíï,
Its fun its like messanger for adults but this is totally for kids it is fun,
Great app except for that you have to update it every other week,
Can't use the app without a parent Facebook account. Discriminating to people who are against and not interested by social media.,

Good for the kiddies to be able to chat especially through the covid pandemic isolation Lockdown no school,
Granny video call and text message And let you have the right answers and the answer is not a problem to hear your answer or whether it will help to get a good night's out in this day with your friends in a few weeks of your favorite holiday and holiday holidays or special holidays or special occasions in your lifetime life to make sure that your friends will enjoy this great time with the baby girl in our home,

I think it is perfect for kids and it is kid friendly,
A great and safe way to keep up with my grandchildren and great nieces.,
Keeps me and my children connected safely securely What else could you ask for as a parent? I recommend it to all parents because you're in control.,
I use messenger and its overall great but I dislike how a parent has to know a nother child's parent for me to friend them.,
I love this app I have used it for years and it's amazing I love the games and other stuff download it nowwwww,
when i put my husbands accnt it didint appear my husbands accnt it was another persons accnt i suggest that u would display all names of the accnt i will search ex. Riley Roberts all riley roberts should appear and the parent will choose their accnt. TY :-),
this is the best app my kids love it they get to stay in touch with love ones and friends and her littel boy friend,
Great app for my kids to call their friends and messege them.,
"It's good for talking with friends, I use it all the time!",
Impressed with how simple you have control,
Messenger kids helps me and for my children and I get alerted when cert and stuff and when they're when they don't answer to her friend my phone blows up,
The reason I gave 1 star is because when I try to make a account it says there's a problem try again pls fix it,

Great for kids who are learning technology,
This app that allows you to make a pet no personal information lets you have friends but your mom or dad last Facebook has to allow that and it has parents to be able to control what they're doing on messenger kids it's like a lifesaver the messenger broke and they can't delete things that they don't want the parents to see,

I think it's great. We need Facebook kids.,

it sucks you only half to text up to 2 people,
It takes so long to do you have to like sign up for it.,
It won't let me create an account for my child and he's under 13! Pisses me off to no end!,
geometry dash meltdown the best way for you and I am a bit more than one of my resume and I will send a message to you soon to discuss this further and I am a little more about your experience,
A great way for kids to get in touch with people with out Facebook because the original messenger requires Facebook,
We get to face time and text i love messenger kids im even a kid i love this so muchüòÅü§£üòÇüòÄ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÇ,
Just waiting to see if the bug will be fixed,
I'm having the same issue as everyone else. My child got logged out and it will accept my password & I know it's right. If anyone has found how to fix this can you post it above please?,
it is realy good sometimes get kicked off but beside that its fine,
im so happy my mom gave me this app i can do lots of fun stuff and design stuff i love ittt,
Messenger kids is a fun and a good game to talk to you friend and thats why i give it five stars,
"Really have to say, that this is the perfect kid's messenger.But 1 thing I don't like is we cannot voice call. THAT DOESN'T MATTER ALL OF THE THINGS ARE FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!",
it is so much easier know that your kid can call there friend from there own divice,
I like to be able to have my children talk with there friends but I can monitor there activity,
"I love this app I use it ALL the time, tho the games could be better",
Can't even make one for my kid keeps saying my account can't be found or invalid password and I know my password is correct please fix this.,
I love itt,
The only part I like about it is that I can text and call my friends and family,
Love that parents have the control! Great app!,
it is a really Safe app and I got permission for my mom to download it and she said yes I you guys should keep it up and I could talk to my friends,
I love it but you have to add some interesting things for the kids,
AS I HAVE FUN I ALSO GET TO TALK TO MY PARENTS AND MY FRIEND'S It's a 5 star rating for me and my family and friends and people should try KIDS MESSAGER SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD/HAVE!&#1üåü#2üåü#3üåü#4üåü#5üåü'S,
I really like this app because the faces are really cool,
My kids love it. They talk to their friends and cousins on camera and through text and I'm able to see who they're chatting with to keep it safe,
Every time I try to call my friends it says it instantly for some reason hangs up on me,
It's amazing u can FaceTime it's so cool,
I love this app is so fun and i felled in 5 stars and you sud get it you well have so much fun,
It's a very nice app so you can talk to your friends,
you need to add two more things 1:a version for pc 2: make a face book kids if you did that i will rate it 5 stars ;),
Can not erase messages when I'm done reading them,
it works great for me it does not freeze or anything like that,
Very user friendly. My kid loves it,
Cool fun text call all that type of stuff.,
"I use it a lot, but I would use it way more if it had screen share",
This app is very usful to me beacuse i can send an mesages to my parents and friends,
"So much better than whatsapp and atleast he can also play games, great app",
This app is amazing but the problem is you must login with Facebook and l hate Facebook so l deleted it,
It is kid friendly You can call your cousins or anyone else I love it if you know I'm a kid,
Fast and user friendly app,
The accounts don't show who left a massage or tried to contact you.,
Mesenger kids is awsome you can video chat. And the best part is you dont have to have to have a phone number. Just give your friend your code.,
It's awesome my kids can facetime their friends during this pandemic,
I looooooooove the app but I'd like kids to be able to delete messages pls,

"A MAJOR flaw, in our blended families opinions, is that there is only an option for two parents/guardians to be attached to the 'kids account.' There should be at LEAST four available. Perhaps even a labeling option to correspond with whoever is linked, I.e. mum, dad, stepmom, stepdad, grandma, grandpa, foster parent, legal guardian, auntie, babysitter...",
My mic broke all the sudden but no other bugs,
Worst thing ever. I just got my daughter a regular messenger account so we could talk whenever,

"Great way to stay connected with his cousins, he's there with out asking me to call or text all the time",
The filters were kiddie but I liked everything else,
This is so good you can face time and text,
I can't create an account for my 8 year old. He keeps saying failed try again.,
I have one problem you have to have internet just to call or text your friends I'm at my grandmas house a lot and she does not have internet and sometimes I wanna call or text my friends but I can't cause my grandma doesn't have internet so if you could fix that you need internet just to talk to friends and family I will edit this to 5 stars,
Its very great because I can chat with my family and other people so yeah hope everyone gives 5 stars,
It's fun because it let's you text your friends,

you cant send your gifs and links stickers ect. because its innapropreate apparently,
Won't let me add more than 10 people to my son's account tells me there's an error and yo try again later,
Great safe way to allow your kids to chat with their friends and family!,

"Great! except, it glitches sometimes",

I like this but you know what you need to ask big emojis big time of veggies and stuff you think they cannot be good but also you should do something that you can share YouTube video with somebody everything in iMessage because everybody say iMessages,
It's the best,
Messenger Kids - The Messenger,
It is the best I can moderate want my kid and his/her friend chat about,
this app doesn't really work on computers,
Won't let me contact my own child when I created theirs through my own account! It's a POS! I'd give it zero stars if I could!,
I like it but I HATE THE FACT that you have to use facebook like I JYST wanted to facetime my friend,
It's a fun app to play and face time with someone in your family,
Pop so cool you can message anyone but me and my sister and my dad and my deal we kind of use it it kind of useful,
My kid loves the messenger kids but he can't set nickname and can't voice call .So he always sees my name on his messenger kids,
I cannot get a one time password I've tried for 3 days it never sends one to my email.Please help me,
It's cool I guess,

The app is good BUT IT TAKES A DAY FOR A TEXT TO BE SENT,

"im entering my password and it says user isnt allowed idk why but i dont really care cuz i use the original messenger, i jist downloaded it to try it out cuz y not",
Love it but the filters are kinda too old,
Some times the phone call hangs up on you,
It won't work at all for my kids. It keeps saying we're in Europe and it won't work even though we're in the US,
The fact that i can see my grandson & he is so many miles away this is awesomely great,
This is a really good game for kids and there parents if ur kids are under 13 I think u should get them dis,
this is good for kids and ther friends so tell your kids to download that if they have friends they want to video chat withb so yea,
Does not allow you to confirm account with parent account. Worthless app,
Fun and useful it works with no cost,
Really fun but sometimes has bugs,
It's a great way to text your friends and family,
Awesome I can text all my friends on it great app,
Love how I can see what my son is doing and that I have control over who he can have on his messenger. Basically uses it to video chat friends n family since he just has a wifi device.,
Need to make options to be able to customize it the way you want to,
when i go into a different app when in a call it hangs up,
best app because me and my friend could now FaceTime üåàü¶ÑüòÑüê±üòâ,
It's rlly fun I got to talk with my cousin's I was so happy this app is perfect ‚ô•Ô∏è <33,

It is bad it keeps crashing,
Takes too much space and glitches,
Love it great way for my kids to get ahold of other kids,
Dude they have something like tik tok cool not to long ago this app sucked i dont have tik tok so this is cool to me,
So this is amazing I use it with all my friends and your parents can control so super safe and you have a code so no one can add you that you don't know I really recommend messenger kids,
Totally get this app you can talk to your friends and family create groups send emojis Put masks on in Call s Get it End if you Update it You get new things To do on it only listen to this review I am a kid and I love it,
It gives me a way to communicate with my son when he's with his other family.,

This is the best kids text that I can use kids messenger,
I like it i can text my bff and video call him and its really cool,
Great way for kids to stay in touch with grandparents. Love it,
This app is good for kids under 8. If your under 13 but over 8 you have nothing.,
I love talking to my friends and texting them!,

Greater than real texting I love it.,
It wont let me open the app and just keeps loading,

OMG!!! My daughter Layla loves messenger kids. She always talks to her friends. if they are not answering her she plays other games for a while. then when it says someone is online Layla comes running to me saying can i talk to Scarlett her friend i say yes always. and she chats for about an hour. then the girls call. and i am totally fine with it. but when shes bad i put it to sleep. Layla loves it. Hi people my name is Layla and i love this app. i give u guys a five starrating thank u and bye,
THIS APP SUCKS BECAUSE IT COULDNT SIGN ME IN BECAUSE IT DIDNT DESIDE TO VERTIFY MY EMAIL (it took me half an hour just to put in my email to) AND THEN I TRYED TO FRIEND MY FRIEND BUT I NEEDED TO KNOW HIS PARENTS THAT I DONT KNOW SO I COULDNT FRIEND MY FRIEND ALSO I GOTTA LITTLE TIP HERE DOWNLOAD DISCORD IT DOES SAY ITS 13 PLUS BUT ITS ALOT MORE EASYIER SO TRUST ME OK,
i think it should be fixed to recieve gif msgs.... at least from approved contacts,
I really love texting my friends without getting an add,
Its just so cool no ads!,
It helps my kids learn and it doesn't matter how much they do,
My sister loves it! Would recamend also its kinda like skipe so why cant people just skipe like...BOIIIII why,
Not letting me log in when I tried to log In it just went back to the start,
Can you not make like a login to facebook because my family does NOT use facebook and i really wanna videochat!>:/,
Well I'll give it a 4 star because it logs(I dont know how to spell some words sorry)me out on the loading screen,
I talk with a lot of people in here and this is the best app ever! (I love this App),
Awsome i love it and i can call all my friends and its just really good,
Get messages but they won't open,
you can call fams or friends to text and call you can also send games and play it what can you do.,
The best app for kids And family and friends all,
I find it easy to get to my grandkids. So awesome.,
Love this app however I blocked a friend from my Facebook and that friend still showed on my kids messenger. They should be automatically removed if I block them.,
This is great!! I can chat with my friends or FAM!! Its greattttt!!,
Its really good fun and safe and suitable for kids i give it a 5 stars,
very nice and simple app.!,
its great but i have to go to google play every time to get on to the app,
Pretty darn good way to communicate if you're a kid.,
Well i just want to tell that please facebook i don't have any facebook account so i just want to unlock the app without any facebook account,
I love how I can just call and talk to my friends one prodlem sometimes when I call you can't see my face and the end,
Not very user friendly for parents.,
I can talk to all of my family and friends thank you for making this app!!,
A bit of independence for my child to connect with his friends but also enables me to suppervise who he interacts with through the internet.,
This good apps very easy my kids and play the games thank you,
I love it is is safe and the parent controls are so easy I love so much,
It takes you on a wild goose chase to add kids. Do not recommend,
I hate this app it will not let me log in and it is so annoying,
NEVER WORKS!!!! REPORTED IT MANY TIMES AND NOTHING IS EVER DONE!!!,
This app is really gun to use and to talk to friends and family,
It's fun to talk to your friends and family I recommend it,
It is fun but not that meny filters i can talk to my older siser and my brother,
It is good because making call when you want,
not working keeps crashing,
It really cool and a good way to keep in touch with my friends üòÄ,
Great way to communicate easily,
this app is good but you need face book like what the heck what if the kids just want face book and not messanger like why do you need face book any way you cant just log in you need face book thats dumb lol wow,
its verry good for kids and i love playing the games,
Games aren't working on device.My child can't play game against her friends.,
"I use it my mom even thinks its great so do I I can call my bff when ever but I just wish I could call off,in but its oky",
it is awesome it helps me video chat my little sister even tho she has a i pad instead of a phone,
So cool it's for kids to .like me you should definitely Download it .ü•∞‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ you could talk to your friends any time,
I love it so much I talk with my friends every day with this app!,
I can't look at pictures friends send me it just exits me out,
It is great I have used it for a month and I can chat with my friends üòâ,
I like this because you get to talk to her other friends but it doesn't concern talking to your mom or your dad or anything and it really shocked say because my dad is in Africa and I can't call him so if you can't do that right then I can't get it no more and my mom's in Tennessee so please do it right and if not then I just cancel out of everything and everything of your lives and everything that ever be done and you would never going to be anything and you left your life cuz I would want it an,
Tge face filters on Facebook are way better then the one in here,
I don't know how much stars so I'll rate it a 1. It isn't letting me create an account for some reason.,
I gave them a 1 star because they can see my camera when I have it off. I got on a call with someone and we took pictures on messenger kids. And we looked at them and we could see our self when we had our camera off.,
It's a good protective way for children to enjoy the internet,
Very great for kids. Daughter loves it,
app no longer opens. please fix!,
Very good app üëç and I can chat with mom and friends üëçüëå‚ù§,
It is a really fun and good for youngsters,
I love it i can chat my friends but one problom it doesnt show the pride flag,
awesome its so handy the only thing i dont like is the passwords i cant remember them,
Gives them something to do when they are bored and have fun,
Don't use this app is very not good I don't want it I try to talk my initials and it didn't make me typed it in and told me my initials is not working and they're neither right I don't know how people use this things these things I mean but they're poor messenger kids is stupid,
I love this app it's fun but the filters are a bit...,
It's really helpful for quick communication.,
It just one more way to help keep them safe,
"Excellent, great way to stay in touch when I cannot be with my grandchild.",
after following direction poor results. My contacts have no kids for my child to chat with.,
Good app have i have trouble make account for little one u need fix the issus ok,

Well this is my review on messenger kids it is a fairly good app for messaging and being in touch with other children my only I have to agree with DuckDuckGo on this Bash it literally tracks kids so they can track them and become more creepy by the day and it could lead to abduction death or robbery final thoughts Facebook please stop being creepy with the kids,

This is perfect for my daughter (9) to communicate with friends and family out of state,
When I get to the picture part it says no internet but when I checked my internet i connected!!!!,
it is is a good app but somehow we can't get it off sleep mode,
Very interactive for kids,

I love this app it has all my friends on it OMG you can play games on it just like roblox!!!!!!!!!!!!,

I have this sense last year and it was so fun! But something creepy happened. I was at my grandma's house and I was on a call with my friend and I saw a man named Adam. Then I saw me bleeding and freaked out because there was an A in the blood. Then I texted my friend. I sent a video and she said after the video I sent her she said He is Preston's brother and he is 14. Preston's her brother's friend. The next day (yesterday) she didn't talk about adam. When your friend is outside say goodbye.,

How do we delete group chat in messenger kids? There should be a way for parents to delete the group chat. Especially when your kid added people from different parts of the world including me and I am sleeping in the middle of the night. Suddenly a relative sent multiple messages. How do we delete a group chat in messenger kids or take a member off the group chat. There should be an option,
Love it This is the best for kids I'm glad this is a thing,
Its nice being able to keep my kids safe online,

To me this is fruad and bothers me greatly. I've reported the account for pretending to be me and I've gotten some of my friends to as well but I want the account removed.",

It's good but it's hard to login,
"The filters make children think badly of the real them, and it is bad.",
It is cool I can talk to my freinds and play minecraft and other stuff,
"Irs amazing! I can text my parents, friends, cousins, and moreL",
it's awesome I'm trying to tell my friends to get this app!,
It's a great way for kids to stay in touch,
"It helps me chat with the people i know to talk with them in the covid,if they are here i dont chat withv them,and i guess that is all i have to say.",
I love it i can call and text my friends and family,
If you want to text your BFF not helpful but still fun,
So far it does nothing ! It doesn't seem to work,
Just talked to people even if you don't FaceTime.,
I love this app great when you want to face time you bff,

It's a good way to connect to best friends and family,

Hi I'm trying to look for a little kid messenger kids but I really want to play it and call my own friends like a little girl named Debbie,
Very glitchy I would give it a 2/10 I would recommend Snapchat if you were looking for a messaging app,
I LIVE THIS APP! In the carona your kids don't see people a lot so if that's what ur dealing with get this app today,
Nice to be able to chat with my friends children without worrying somebody bad is watching .,

It is really good to have you can talk to you're friends üòä,

This app is not working properly,
Its a good control mechanism for kids to keep them away from people who they don't know.,
Very good video connections,
Love this app I can call and message my friends without taking my mother's phone,
Y'all can talk to people and the only bad thing about is that your parents can see it in my opinion add this app and ask your friends if they have this app and that is my opinion on this app,
I love this app I go on it Everyday and call or text my friends,
It's very easy to have when you're like poop,
"its a great way for me to talk to peaple even if we are 6,000 miles away.",
good for children & grandchildren,
It's a good app for little kids,
Bro i was literally on it then it logged me out messenger needs to fix this.please please please im so aggervated.and i love this app.,
My account wont authenticate for my child to use his messenger. This doesn't work!,
"amazing btw Everybody knows my name now But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself And seein' somebody else And everything is not the same now It feels like all our lives have changed Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down But it's killin' me now What if you had it all But nobody to call? Maybe then you'd know me 'Cause I've had everything But no one's listening And that's just lonely I'm so lonely Lonely Everybody knows my past now Like",
I love that I can talk to my freinds without some weirdo trying to find me and I like messenger kids beacause I get to see my freinds without having to go to their house...but it costed money after a few days and that did not happen on my tablet!!!!,

"Look understandable app its good i rated it low so it can make top of the low rating list i rate it low due to the fact its for kids personal opinion if youre so worried about your kid speak to someone they shouldnt don't give them internet nor a phone i have found mulitple ways around this. As a parent im sure it is scary having your kid learn more things and speak to people and not know this app helps you but by you always being over their shoulder they wont a parent that monitors their kid wont feel like their trusted and soon they'll be a teen or is now and feel subconscious about their actions leading to depression and possible drug and alcohol use or suicide my opinion and if any law form pops up my rights adminmeant 1 freedom of speech and the press, plus i dont care weather my words harm said reader which is you have a nice day",
It says I have it but it is not showing up in apps,

awesome for kids ! I control it all no matter where I am .,
Its cool but my dad is gonna take it off so i tollk it off,
It glitched way to much and the games are tarabol,
I don't always get notified if someone texts me,
I can't here the person I am taking to and it's really hard to use so this why I given one star,
Ew it needs cute fitters and new games,
the only lesson im getting from this is that someone is always controling you no matter what.like your parents or someone else that has control over what you say to people or friends and family.and it's not fun.AND I BET ALOT OF KIDS ARE AGAINST THIS.and the sleep mode does not matter.i can change the time to day when ITS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.and what if a kid is in trouble.they can't text there parents or friends.üòü,
I can text so many people,
Love it because i can talk to my friends that don't have Snapchatüêé,
It is the best messaging app I have ever used,
I love this app because it helps me allot instead of calling using my money,

This is an interesting and fun app but one issue my mom or my sister and brother can't send attachments in the group chat because I'm a child i cannot look at it because I'm a child. My mom has tried to send some but can't sometimes she forgets she can't. Fix the issue so i can look at attachments also there is so many issues and bugs fix them too,
I love talking to my friends on this app,

You can call, text, and even send drawings! You can have big group chats and still be able to call them! Edit: (September 10th) My messages aren't being sent or not until 3 minutes later. This is very annoying üòî Please fix this, if you do I'll bring me review up",

Mentioned,
Love the app for messaging my children and family and friends love that they can be in touch as well. Only giving the two star rating due to the fact that the children do not have the same access or cannot be given access to playing games amongst other family members and their friends. probably the only disappointing part about the app,

"I think the concept of this app is great. My oldest (8) has already unsuccessfully tried to create her own Facebook page as she sees ""everyone is using it"" and naturally wants to be a part of it. This allows her to feel like she is a part of it but I have peace of mind it's essentially safe. I would like to see some more features within the app. Right now as her parent I can approve who she can and can't talk to as well as log in to check up if I feel necessary. I think having some type of screen time control, maybe even tips or a tutorial on messaging etiquette for the kids, and more marketing so their friends are more likely to have an account!",
"Love the app. but to change my profile picture the camera on messenger for kids is messed up, on my phone the camera is fine, so I'd like that fixed",

"**updated review** They seem to have updated the app that addresses the problem I was previously having as listed below. I am currently having no problems with the app or login and am pleased to have it back again. Previously installed on iPad and then installed on a different tablet and other devices; completely unable to login to the account. When attempting to verify account I constantly get the ""unable to find account"" message even though my FB account is fine and even has my kids listed under it. I have tried every need help and login assistance listed and have used 2 or 3 different feedback avenues and have gotten no response.",

"I was excited about this app, but there are few options, especially privacy settings. My child can access all my files or nothing, and he can't use the app at all to send messages or video chat if I don't allow access to my files. I want him to be able to use the camera and only access photos he takes through the app, but that is not an option, making this app useless. Also, when I turn off the permissions, if he can figure it out (he's 2 and a half, so what he can figure out is limited, but he also knows and figures out more than you'd think) he can turn them on himself. Only the parent should be able to mess with the options. Also, sleep mode is all or nothing as well. I don't want him calling kids after their bedtimes, but he should still be able to call his grandparents for a few more hours, but you cannot specify who he can call when. This is a good idea for an app, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1, but it is just not ready to be used safely. Additional issues: When receiving video chat, the volume was extremely low and could not be turned up, so would have to call back to be able to hear. Also, my child's grandparents are not on my friends list (I post a lot of political stuff and want family out of those conversations), and you can't add them to messenger. I have a secondary Facebook account for trusted people where I share more photos of and info about my son that I wouldn't share with everyone on my own friends list for child safety purposes, and I had to log into that account to be able to add those family members. You should be able to add non Facebook friends.",
Video chat don't work can't see my friends and family and they can't see me. Otherwise it's a great app and would really like to be able to video chat. Please fix it.,
I keep trying to set this up for my daughter and it keeps saying that my Facebook account can't be found.,
I wish there was an ability to set a schedule where kids can't get responses after a certain time.,
Won't open on notebook tablet,
The thing won't even turn on,
Well it is a safe verision of messenger and yeah its nice and safe,
I have not tryed it yet i hope it is good im exited becuase this is my first phone ever im 9 years old and im so happy my granpa got it for me and i saw storm from x man in real lifeeee ehhhhhhhhhhh yayyyyyyyy,
Not sure of anything. My kid can't even get past the take a photo part.,
Cant video chat at all with my granddaughter. Just messages and photos !,
"Won't let me log in with my account. Deleted and downloaded app again, still no change.",

Keeps rebooting on start up on my daughters tablet,
Great app,
I love it,
Would like to be able to edit the contact list with out having to block contacts.,
I thank it a go for people,
"It wouldn't even let me log in. Keeps saying my login info is wrong, which it's not. Please fix this",
My only concern is that I did not get notified of the video calls. That to me is a concern for safety reasons. I would most prefer a recording of whatever video chats take place. Aside from that we love it so far!,
"I would like the option as a parent to delete messages without deleting the contact, it does not appear to allow this. Also, to add contacts im not friends with, i dont want to have to friends via fb with someone to add rhem to his acct. I really like the rest of the app",
This is amazing and I love the way you can take a lot of pictures on this app that's why this app is amazing and awesome thanks for looking at my post bye guys also subscribe to .y channel that's Londyn cutie pie,
Couldn't even log in. Tries to set it up and it kept saying account not found. I tried everything. I know what my phone number and email for my Facebook is,
I can't even sign in to this app because its saying my password is incorrect.,
Does not work at all. I'm unable to initiate any kind of calls or messages.,
I can't put it on speaker phone so I can watch my son. To hear him I have to hold it to my ear,
Sometimes it's a annoying and freezes up but on the other hand it's better than FaceTime LOL,
"Its ok. It freezes up all the time, so i don't know what to do. Otherwise, i liked it :3",
Couldnt verify my account but shows I run the account. Stupid,
This app is amazing. I'm able to text my parents and friends.,
I'm going to it my friend,
I really like this i can call my mom and dad and my friends it is really cool WOWüòÄüëè,
I love how its safe and how when you call people you see there face and how you can text people,
Love it my son really enjoys being able to call his grandparents on his tablet!,
Cannot video chat or send voice messages,
My daughter and I love this app so far,
Love it. My kids r able to stay in touch with family,
Worked fine for a month now won't do video at all,
I can't take pictures with the filters anymore,
It OK but this app need to take Facebook thing off!! üò†üò†üò†üò°,
Says No Account found. Doesn't Work. Oh well.,
I've tried for days to set it up but it can not find my Facebook,
I dont know,
Love it so much,

Kool,
Love,
My son uses to talk to family but when they send a voice message it says downloading and also with the pictures not sure wjats going can u pleaae fix,
We updated the app and it's not letting us send or recieve audio or send or recieve photos. Everything is fine just wish we could recieve the photos and audio.,
IT SUCKS,

Can't find my account to be able to set up anything. After seeing the other reviews that have the same complaint I'm wondering if Facebook is even correcting the issue?,
Messanger kids is an amazing app for kids to have a fun conversation and i just thing thats its amazing!! üòä,
I love because my kids. Gets text her friend in gramama,
It says it can't find my account. It needs an option to report that.,
Fun for me the kid is and safe to use.,
Bogus!! I can't find my account!!,
All-time favorite app üòç,
My filters won't load :/,
The mom fat despacio,
I like it,
Ok,
"We are a family from the USA with US phones and service through Google's Project Fi. We are currently traveling in Mexico and this app says it is not supported in our area after I install it and verify it on my child's device through my Facebook account. I can use regular Messenger and Messenger Lite, but not Messenger for kids. This really sucks. Trying to replace Allo for a messaging app to use with my kids.",
"So far, so good! We tried it out this morning and I was able to video chat with my son who is using an old phone on Wi-Fi, no actual cellular connection. We were able to send messages and emojis. My older brother and cousin were also able to send messages to my son. I like that I have full control over everything my son does. I do WISH that it had a feature that sent every message sent by my son and to my son to my messenger just as a precautionary measure! Maybe that's something the developers could figure out in future updates! For now though, I REALLY wish we would have had this app during the summer to be able to communicate with him while my wife and I were at work! Thanks developers! P.S. I also really love that this doesn't require him to start Facebook to use!!",
"I love that my son can talk to friends and relatives, the only down side is i have recently noticed that i am not able to view my sons response to people. He actually pointed this out to me because he had to use my phone and noticed some missing text.",
"Won't connect to make a video call, won't load any GIFs not impressed with this app if it worked right it would be cool for my kid to talk to family and friends but until the bugs are worked out it's a no-go for me",
It wouldn't let me put the people i wanted then some random person was added the app said you have to ask him to add you friends then he said he don't know me or what i am talking about. .,
"The idea of this app is honestly amazing. I would love to use it for my daughter, but for some reason it will not allow me to finish setting it up. The account is for certain set up but every time I go into it, it makes me agree to the terms again and take picture again and wont go any further. Please fix this and I will happily change the rating as well as reply with an update.",
Works ok on my phone so far but I was trying to put in on my kids tablet and all it does is keep load and crash on loading page. Can't do nothing on his tablet.,
I cannot get into the app I put my email in and it says account not found.....this problem needs to be fixed,
Can't connect to my Facebook account. Keeps saying it can't find my account.,
"Can't even set it up!! I'm trying to ""find my account"" and it says no account exists with my email or phone number. Such a waste of time and thanks so much for getting my kids hopes up.",
Its not better than normal messenger but its ok,
Would not connect to my Facebook account. Unable to log in at all.,
Haven't had a real chance to use it yet.,
Keep saying my account os not found!,
This is good if you want to text someone or video chat with them,
This is fine and dandy and all but what about parents that have multiple kids like me.,
Not able to use video function with daughter,
Telling me it cant find my account,
I can't get on it i dont know my mom's Facebook acount!!,
When I add family members to my daughters contacts it doesn't let her or them message,
I can communicate easily with family and friends.,
It doesn't recignize my FB. Dumb app.,
I wish there was a way to delete old messages.,
great job üëèüëåüëç,
I think it is nice for kids,
Kind of like it '~',

so far! Already recommended to friends.",
"Text works fine, video either black or cant hear the person or I can hear 
them and they cant hear me. Rarely works without one of these errors.",
"This app is great...WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING. Problem is that it never 
works right. You would think that Facebook would get this right",
"This app was good until yesterday when it stopped working. All I get now 
when I open it is a flashing logo.",
"Loved it while it worked... Now when I try to open the app it won't open. 
Tried reinstalling and it didn't help",

Amazing app! I love this app because it gets my kid active with nature,
After about 1 week it stopped working.,

"Doesn't let my daughter link with other users and deletes her messages 
sometimes saying they're inappropriate but won't let me review it and I 
KNOW she's not sending anything bad...",

"Some update happened. Can no longer sign in. Says ""something went wrong"" 
takes you to resign in, and just revolves the same thing over",
"Worked great until it updated. Now it wont even open. Went from a 5 star to 
1. Unusable and taking up space. To the trash you go.",
"Cant even log into the damn thing to finish setting it up. Ive put in my 
email in and a account wasnt found.",
"I really really really LOVED THIS APP but now I am Really kind of mad right now, Messenger Kids was working fine until it updated and now it keeps kicking my kid off .

"I'm all in on this app. My daughter can't add contacts. Only I can from my 
fb account which is great. My only problem and reason for 3 stars is when I 
call her it doesnt pop up unless she already has the app open. 9 times out 
of 10 she doesnt have the app open because she's doing other things on the 
tablet or isnt on it. It needs to function in the same manner the regular 
messener app functions. When some one calls or sends a message on my phone 
it rings /notifying me regardless of what I'm doing on my phone. Please fix 
the notifications or provide support on what settings need to be altered to 
make the app ring on her tablet when not in use. Amazon fire 7 tablet. 
Everything is up to date.",
"Tried to install on two different android devices for my son and can't  finish the install. I get to the ""take a picture "" part and it gets stuck.  ***update 7/16/18 *** I tried again, on a phone and a tablet, and it seems that the app gets stuck after I take the photo during the setup process.  I take the photo, it recognizes it and sets it as his profile photo, then asks me to take a photo..... Does anyone know how to fix this?  My son has my old Galaxy S5 and a Samsung tablet and they both get stuck in the same place.  I'd really like to be able to use this as several of his friends have it.",
"Great start! So many things could be improved though. There needs to be a 
way to specify multiple adults as parents, and a better way to monitor 
their accounts. It's annoying that they are able to send GIFs freely, yet 
adults cannot send any GIFs to them. One issue we have is that our kids use 
Amazon Freetime on their Kindle Fires. When something is sent to them, 
there's no way for them to be notified unless they are on the app.",
"It won't let my son get on every time I try to take a photo of him it 
changes to the screen saying the app is a sleep come back when the app is a 
wake.",
Cannot give authorization on children's devices to complete set up. Hoping this issue will be resolved soon. It doesn't recognize my log in credentials.,
"Cannot log out. Constantly getting calls from kids when my dgtr is not 
avail. I had to uninstall",
"Absolute junk. Can't sign in, with a fb account I have had since 2008. 
Can't upload a profile pic. Please fix",
"I love this app so much but I wish there was a way to disable video calling 
if you choose.",
"Well it logged out of my account and now we cannot figure out how to go 
back in cuz it just keeps logging into my mother's Facebook and I cannot 
get the other password we try to do forgot password even though putting in 
the right one and it just won't let us have any of it",
"My own messenger kicks me back out after setting my daughter's account with 
this dumb app! Fix my phone!",
"Dumb. Can't even find my Facebook account for my daughter to use even 
though I'm logged into my Facebook account on the same device!!! Saying it 
can't find my account even though I'm 100% sure what my account info is.",
"I cant get into the app and i can answer any questions because my parents 
and i both dont have any facebook accounr and even if my mom would have 
made one it wouldn't even make a difference because it wont work with my 
aunts account",
"Please fix!!!!!! I downloaded this on all 3 of our devices and I cannot 
sign in with neither my husbands or my fb acct. It acts like its logging in 
and kicks me back out.",
"It will NOT let me log in when I'm already logged into fb. Will not let me 
past authorizing my acct so I cannot report on the actual app. It's as if I 
dont even have a fb acct.....won't recognize ANY log in info or phone #. 
Fix the glitch cuz I'd like to try this app.....",
This app is great for parents who want their child to be safe,
It is good for kids to connect with there family and close friends,
Very good app my kid has it and she loves it,
It lets me talk to the people on my contacts and i think its awesome.,
"I love it, but can you let me use it on landscape and do voice calls while 
I'm still in the app?",
"Won't authenticate on anything, stuck in a do loop.",
For my young kids..... it is wonderful and easy to keep an eye on them,
Can't get it to validate my phone or email sooo...... it won't work. At all.,
This app is great I can call all of my friend's and it's very safeüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ,
It so much. Great. Job,
I like it im so ‚ò∫,
Pretty good ‚ù§Ô∏è,
It's good,
Love itüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ,
Love it,
It is alsome,
"For one, if you have strict parents this app will be absolutely terrible, you will not be able to add your friends (probably because your friends aren't losers and have to use apps such as this) two, their is custom colors but no dark mode, why? And the app is extremely large with very little capability since you can't remove messages it uses lots of space especially when your parents buy you a terrible phone (like me) ok that's all I have to say, and parents please don't use this app for kids.",
"I love this app, it let's my kids chat with there friends and family 
without me having to worry about who they are talking to. I have one issue 
tho, they will open there profile and will have messages that are no longer 
there with message that says 'something went wrong, please try again, but 
the messages never come back. I'm not sure if this has to do with the fact 
that I have 3 children with their pub profile or what, but it is very 
annoying!!",
"It's stupid cuz I can't even it use it cuz nobody has Facebook so why do 
you always just have to use Facebook all of a sudden it's like the new thing",
"This app is horrible.my mom go it for me and when it said sighn in to your 
facebook account my mom does not have facebook.why would this app think 
avery parent has facebook",
"At first I loved the app, but then one day I tried to use it and it would 
go to a white screen, for like a second, and go to the home screen.",
"Having OTHER ppl to dwnload the app is dumb af! That takes up data & memory 
on THEIR PH!",
I DONT LIKE IT AT ALL BECAUSE. of the face book,
"It's awesome I can't text my grandma and my aunt and my mom and my Spanish 
teachers wife /my mum and dads friend",
"I think it's sh..when you have to use fb to use your acct...not everyone 
likes fb some of us have Google or other options we prefer. Blahhh with 
your FB.",
"Don't like it because when my sons tablet is not in use the calls won't 
come through..",
"After the initial setup it stopped working properly. At random itnwould say 
that the app had stopped working.",
"I forgot my password and my child needs to get in without my facebook i 
will alwase check her messages",
"Its awesome like I can call and text my parents when ever I want. Its 
really fun also and a lot safer than regular messenger I mean its fun and 
all but its kinda creepy too. (Messenger) üòÇüòÇüòÇ",
Its ok it just wont let me pic my own pic,
"This app is the best i can be able to facetime my parents and text my 
family as well but the best thing is that my parents dont have control of 
the app so YAYYYY!!!!!!!!",
It's very difficult to use and I wish they would make it easier to use,
"I think it's absolutely amazing, there's only one problem I'm not sure why, 
but I'm not able to send a video to someone.",
"My grandson loves this app.it also helps him Lerner how v to spell.great 
app.",
Its A Realy Cool Messenger App For Kids,
Perfect app for our Children. It as though we designed it ourself.,
Great app I contact my cousin in Minnesota from Texas,
"Got all set up then, now it says, ""something went wrong,"" and won't display 
or send messages. üò†",
Horrible don't get this app,
It really helps me to talk to my family,
This is better than the other one,
I LOVE THIS APP‚ù§,

HUN,
"I think it is a fun app but it keep taking my favorite filters out like the 
fox with glasses, and if a person isn't online it doesn't send fully until 
they go online, it also doesn't let you call if they are offline. It'll say 
connecting and then hang up. If they are online it'll say connecting then 
calling. I mean if it was an emergency and you need to call someone, like 
an adult, if they are offline you can't call. It would be connecting 
forever and then hang up. It won't even call, it would just day connecting.",
"Go to sign in and it seems like it's logging in but then says logging out 
and brings me back to the first page. I even typed a wrong password and it 
says, do you need help. So I know its linking to my fb account. Sad, I 
really wanted my daughter to use this.",
"It sucked. It kept saying couldnt find my account and I tried everything. 
No way I will reinstall this in less they figure out how to fix that",
"My 6yr old daughter is at her mother's for a month and this has been a 
great way for her to keep in contact with me. She messages me and/or video 
chats me everyday. This app has been amazing. Thank you facebook for this 
app. This is usually a sad month for me but this has made it much better.",
"This app is stupid because you need facebook and I am only 8 this is my 
dad's acount on my phone and I don't have parentel guidence for this",
"I have done everything asked and we still can't get the app to work on my 
child's phone",
It's great but I wish there were more things to do on the photos,
"I couldn't talk to my cousin but now I have this it made my life so much 
better GET IT NOW",
"Dont like the fact that I cant approve of what he is sending out for videos 
first at least. It should at least send me a notification I think.",
I HATE IT MY FAMILY DOESNT HAVE FACEBOOK AND WE DONT WANT IT,
I hate it this should be for kids you should not have to log in to facebook,
"Was great until the last update and now it won't let my daughter see her 
messages. It keeps saying something went wrong please try again",

LAGGY!but for some reason it the camera is all messed up",
"I'm in the us and it tells me messenger kids not available in your region

"I live in the United States of America and it says that it's not available 
in my region when my little sibling has this app is using it for a while 
now why won't it let me use it",
Yay,
"Was working get for a few days and now it keeps saying logging out. When I 
tried to reauthorize the device, it said something was wrong. I changed my 
password, thinking I was typing it wrong, and still got the same error 
message. ""Something went wrong"". My kid loved this app, because he got to 
talk to his cousins. But this really upset him.",
"App worked really good on both my daughters phones, then one quit working. 
Saying you logged out. Fix for it was go to apps on phone, uninstall 
updates on Google Play Store app then install updates too Google Play then 
clear cache data uninstall messenger kids app then install it again and 
worked. The app is not getting the whole download of app. After all that it 
is a awesome app for kids. Love it.",
"Downloaded the app for my daughter worked fine for a few days. She loved it 
and so did I. Then all ofba sudden it kept saying logging out and won't let 
her back in. When it says there was a problem and asked for parent to sign 
in it then says there's a problem. I deleted and reinstalled the ap 3 times 
even made a new account and still same problem. Hopefully it get a fixed. 
If it didn't do that then I wouldn't of voted 5 stars.",
"I have a profile for both of my son's on this app and they love it for 
keeping in touch with friends that have moved and grandparents. However, on 
of my son's accounts works great and updates, the other account won't show 
or save any chat history and continually gets error messages. I hope the 
developer fixes this soon, it's very frustrating. Once it's fixed, I will 
update my review. Also, it's extraordinarily frustrating that customer/tech 
support is practically nonexistent.",
My daughter was staying with my grandmother and my grandmother fell and hurt herself. THIS APP BLOCKED AND DELETED A PICTURE OF HER ARM THAT I ASKED MY DAUGHTER TO SEND ME. I ENDED UP HAVING TO DRIVE ACROSS TOWN TO TREAT IT MYSELF WHEN SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THE FIRST AID KIT. STOP READING AND CENSORING MESSAGES THAT KIDS ARE TRYING TO SEND TO THEIR PARENTS! I CAN'T EVEN RECOVER THE PICTURE. SCREW YOU FACEBOOK.,
"This app is complete JUNK, I've literally been trying to get it on my sons 
phone for over an hour and it wont open.",
"I was so excited to hear about this app. Downloaded fine in my daughter's 
phone, got to set it up but now it doesn't let her logging in. Keeps 
logging out on its own. But what I don't get is I downloaded the app on my 
phone and it works just fine. So what gives, it only works on newer phones? 
So disappointed.",
"Horrible, doesnt let you pick a picture from the gallery and doesn't let 
you change your name, also won't let you contact whoever you choose (is 
difficult to set up)",
"The app opened once and I was able to send a couple messages but when I 
tried to authorize another device the app stopped working. Only thing it 
would do when trying to log in is say, ""logging out"".",
"Downloaded this and it is telling me I do not have an account with my email 
and phone number. Disappointed",
"This is such a great app. I love it. this app helped me find a way to text 
and video chat on my tablet #lovethefilters",
"Worked just fine on my daughters phone and got her a new one and now it 
will not let her log in. Keeps saying something is wrong. But I can log in 
on my phone and it works just fine. Need to fix it for a galaxy s6.",
"I would like it if I could mute the ringer on my phone so when my daughter 
gets a call it doesn't ring a gazillion times on my phone.",
"It's a great idea, but it's telling my son that something went wrong, 
please try again when he tries to look at some messages.",
"Its not working, have tried to set up on new phone, I log in and it says 
something went wrong and will not work, have been trying over a week to get 
this to work",
"I like it but I would of rate 4 stars only if the flitter didn't take so 
long. And they need to add more stuff. Overall it's good",
"This app is an affront to the value of childhood. It's a gateway drug 
disguised in stickers and bright colours. Young minds do not develop 
properly in cyberspace.",
"Not happy, thought this was going to be a good app for kids but i kepp 
getting an error message ""something went wrong""",
"I would like the ability to add people who are not on my friends list, some 
people only have messenger.",
"Worked fine for awhile until my daughter got a new device now it won't let 
me log her on",
"It won't work right on my phone. It worked very good and now it won't let 
me log in and it says something went wrong. Please fix this!! This was a 
good app for my kids.",
"FIX THIS APP! I have 2 accounts and only 1 will work the other account 
won't log on and has constant glitches! I expect so much more from a 
Facebook associated App",
"It worked great for a few days then kept logging my son off and won't let 
me log him back in. I've tried everything. Please fix this!",
"this app is a great way to communicate with your kids and also not let them 
having a Facebook account üëå",
"It's not letting me set up my sons account....I am the trying to connect 
his with mine & I know my login& password is right & every time I type it 
in...I get an error message please fix",
"I loved this app in the beginning but then it took him out and now every 
time I try to log back in it tells me something is wrong try again I been 
trying ALL day and NOTHING onces this is fixed I'll give a 5 start!!",
"It works for my kids to talk which is cool but it has no parental control 
section like it said and I can't add or take off anyone after initial set up",
Doesn't work. Logs me out as soon as I log in.,
I couldn't get on nothing,
"When my mom got this it was awesome to be able to text my friends and 
family... I Love this app",
I hate it I'm just helping them out with the Stars,
don't get it it's a fake you have to use Facebook to get it.,
"Absolutely love this app works fine for me anyway and my daughter 
absolutely loves it and so do her friends",
It is good my 10 year old son loves it,
Sometimes it mess up my phone .,
It's amazing all those years for regular messenger now THIS 1000 STARS,
This is the best app me and my friend can FaceTime each other and we are BFF,
This looks fun but... it wants your Facebook account,
This is a fun way to contact my mom,
This is so awsome coolest app ever,
I love it now I can text and call anyone,
"Every time I try to pick my account it says logging out when I'm trying to 
log in",
Its awesome i can connect to other kids!,
Can't light in sting can't find account,
It was really fun for my kids,
I love this is the best app in the world,
App won't let me sign in,
"Why is the camera sideways in the app? The camera is fine in every other 
app except this one. Please fix.",
Pretty good i may ask!,
I don't like it but I do not have face book!!!!üòàüòàüòàüò§üò§,
You have to have a face book account,
I like this so so much.,
"It says not available in my region and my mom has it on here phone and it 
works",
I can't use it because I want my dad not to no,
Didn't work!,

I love it,
"Overall good concept. My daughter would like to have a wider range of 
stickers she's able to use (such as I have MLP and it's not available on 
the kids messenger). And I can't send her pictures with half of the filters 
she's able to send me. I wish you could change the nickname for who they 
can't talk to so they see aunt Deb or uncle Bob & not Deborah blah blah 
blah and Robert insert last name here they don't recognize. Good concept, 
just needs some tweaks.",
It's an Amazing app my mom downloaded this app for me but I get bored fast..,
"I wanted to download this on my child's tablet so I can talk to her. 
Apparently the Samsung tablet is not compatible with this app. If it is for 
kids than why is it not compatible with tablets.",
"I gave it four stars because it crashes alot. But other than that, it is 
the best",
"As a parent I love this idea, however, I do not like that my child gets my 
Facebook and messenger notifications. This needs to be fixed, until that is 
done, I am deleting the app from my son's phone.",
"Worked great for a while, but now we can't log in. Says we need to check 
our internet connection. We're connected, however. So now we are looking 
for something else for our kids to use.",
"I love this app (and I'm the kid not the parent) the only thing that's a 
problem is that there should be a thing my mommy to add my daddy as a parent",
Won't let me face time my kids. There's sound but the camera won't work.,
"I think it'll work out just fine for the communications between the kids 
and the adults and help them build communication between themselves as 
children",
I like it but I need a search thing people,
"More safer than snapchat,messenger ,facebook,Instagram all of that stuff 
for kids to have",
I love this app because i can talk to my bff,
I can help my granddaughter s stay in touch with one another,
Sending invites and managing friends is hard but it works same as mesanger,
I can text my family,
"Not available in the U.S. , what a worthless waste of time",
Great fun is Messenger ever for kids!,
It is just the best app ever,
I love the kid vesin better,
I like it becomes I have group chats,
Why do people have to Singh up,
"Can't upload a picture from my gallery for the profile picture. Will only 
let you take a selfie for profile pic.",
Not available in my region... :(,
Me me big boy,
"Cannot authorize account. It worked the first time but now I can't find my 
account for it to log in for my child to use",
Good but bad,
Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
I love this app,
This is a safe app,
I love it,
I love it,
U love it,
great app,
Boring,
Awesome,
Cool,
Great,
Awesome,
Fun,
"I don't even like it because first not just a facebook (most parents DO NOT 
have facebook) but you should use google too because google is for parents 
too",
It's gate,
"I like it . I hear some people say it like Snapchat for kids but even 
though it's Jr. Messenger so anyway you should get it for your kid",
Help,
No,
"The app keeps messing up. Half the time there is no volume. I'm not sure 
what's going on with it",
"It worked the first time I logged my son in, but now it continously stars 
that something went wrong during authorization. Tried it on different 
devices and no way to fix.",
"I'm having trouble trying to long my son in it keeps saying something went 
wrong wont let him add his pic so ppl know who he is keeps saying no 
internet like idk what's going on",
It keeps that something wrong and it would not let login in,
THIS. APP. IS. AMAZING. It's so easy to message and you can create group chats and you can do things like filters and emojis and stickers and gifs!! WOW!!!,
"Worked the 1st time and we loved it, now it keeps saying something went 
wrong and won't work. Please fix!!!",
Amazing,
"I love this app it is safe and the parents have to set it up and everything 
I like how you can talk to other kids and you know who it is and I like 
that you can customize the app!",
"I understand the Concept of only allowing my contacts to be able to connect 
with my kids- however, I was trying to set this up so that my child can 
talk to a separated parent, and unless that parent (and any of that side of 
the family) is a friend of mine- they were unable to connect. Frustrating, 
since I'm trying to let her have connection with her family without me 
having to. So I will uninstall. If I'm going to have to have direct 
contact, I might as well just let her do it through my account.",
"The app itself functions well. The sound is a little dulled somehow. My 
three additional features I would want to see in the future would be: have 
the capability to allow my wife to have control over the children's 
accounts as well using her own Facebook, being able to remotely be aware 
that they are on it and possibly whom they are talking to, and finally 
being able to add someone who either has Facebook messenger and no account 
or someone whom I am not friends with for personal reasons. If in the 
future I see at least the last feature added, I will consider bumping this 
up to five stars.",
"I've just recently downloaded messenger kids so I don't know much about it 
yet but I absolutely love the way it sounds. In all honesty I only wish 
that it was thought of and created before. I've had allot of problems in 
the past involving my child, Facebook, and Facebook messenger! So thanks 
guys, this is absolutely awesome! I just hope it works correctly!!!",
"Great concept and I love that my son can talk to his papaw in video chat 
but this app should not be able to send pictures from my camera roll. There 
is no way to turn it off all the way. I disabled it but all he has to do is 
click allow and he can send all my pictures.",
"It's a great app for protecting our children from the dangers of social 
media. As parent you have the control of who your child chats with or plays 
games with. They don't need a Facebook acct either. You log into your acct 
an give permission to them on your Facebook messenger. Great app!",
"Signed up and it worked but then it signed out and just gives me 
Authentication failed...something went wrong try again later message every 
time.",
"It will not work says internet not connected. I've tried everything 
uninstall, reinstall, restart phone. Nothing works not for Android.",
"Just installed on daughter phone, set up sleep time for her an hour before 
bedtime. She is playing game and sleep mode keeps popping open. Will check 
in tomorrow when she actually gets to use it to see what contacts she can 
access.",
"It won't let authorize device for child to use it. Keeps saying, something 
went wrong. Even after uninstall and reinstall. Please fix",
"Worthless garbage,unable to login. I write software for a living this 
should be the easy part. No help in forums or on trouble shooting site.",
"Can not authorise on Android tablet. Tells me to check internet connection. 
it will install on my Android phone :(",
"It will not even let us log in it states authorization has failed. Waste of 
time",
"Once my daughter turns on a filter when she wants to turn them off she 
can't so she hangs up and calls back. Super annoying.",
"I think it's pretty cool because you get to call people and text people and 
it's like when your things you pretty much like to do half the day and it's 
pretty cool and stuff like that and yeah",
"Its very secure and useful. You can make video calls. Its a great way to 
have fun and communicate safely.",
"Nothing works! Picture for icon can't be selected from gallery has to be a 
new picture. And gives error messages on all conversations. Lame",
"Can't even use the app. Everytime I try to authorize it, it tells me my 
credentials are invalid. I have changed my password 3 different times now 
and it still doesn't work.",
"I love it but there's one thing that gave it a 4 when the app goes to sleep 
it never lets me have time to enjoy the other games because it keeps poping 
up.üò†",
"This thing sucks...my child only has two people to use this on and I can't 
add one because it can't find the contact so I guess grandma doesn't get to 
talk to her grandchild according to this thing",
"Would've gave 5 stars if they had the fb messenger games like Everwing, 
Poop, and the Fishing game.",
"It worked great for a few days but now it won't let people see me when I 
video call them. It keeps saying ""Can't open camera right now.""",
"A great way to access what your kids are doing. It seems more safe. The 
only thing i wish they had is games like on the regular messenger app.",
"Unable to add a profile pic Does not allow to add people that I am are 
friends with...",
"My kids love using this to talk with cousins who live out of state. I like 
that I can choose who they talk to, and even control when they can talk.",
"Doesn't work. Just says something went wrong when I try to log in. I posted 
in the help forum and Facebook's response was to post in the forum if you 
need help. Less than helpful.",
"It was fun and a good idea while it worked (4hrs). But now it won't stop 
glitching and I can't fix either of my kids accounts.",
"Not sure why but it appears that I can't control my daughters app....can 
someone help before I delete this app",
"Your messages for sign in is confusing, and the codes you want are not 
clear.",
You can talk to like mom dad sister aunts uncles cousin's crushes bff's,
It won't let me or my child log in. Keeps saying unauthorized,
I love this app and it means so much to stay in contact with my BFF thank you..‚ô°,
"It's a good app I love it she can now talk with her cousins she only like 
once a year",
I wish the app didn't need Wi-Fi,
"It's worked for a week and now won't let parent login due to problem with 
authentication",
Because I can talk to my friends and family,
"I do like the content control. I wish we could add people without them 
being our friends on our fb page and that the games were available for 
their use in the conversations",
Can't hear each other when we call.,
"It worked for one day the kept saying something went wrong this is a good 
way for my child to talk to my family and he can't even do that now",
Video chat is extremely quiet. Cannot hear the other party.,
"This app is awesome I think it is awesome because allows you to talk to 
people that have real messenger my dad and my mom",
Can't install on Samsung Tablet,
"Theres no way I can cancel this account because my kid can do much with 
it......s o can I cancel or I just uninstalled",
Can not voice or video call,
Won't let us sign in anymore,
I love how you can call ppl,
"I am trying to delete a conversation on my kids app and it won't allow me 
delete it anyone know how?",
Will not let me log in after authorizing the account,
I don't like it BC I can't play games with my brothers in the group chat,
How do u make the other Persons face show up when u call them?,
"I lik it and don't because every time i get in to it, it won't let me so i 
have to sign in all the time",
It's horrible,
This is so awesome üòú,
It is fun and very safe,
Gr8 app for kids and families,

Hi,
üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé,
"I liked the idea but when my son when to use it, it gave him free range to 
message.any person whose phone number I had ever saved. I had assumed it 
would only allow him to contact those I had chosen. But that was not the 
case. I can not risk him messaging his principal or anyone else not 
approved one day on a whim. So I had to delete it. Great idea bad execution.",
"I think this is a good app, my son loves it. I think it would be better if 
the sound were louder, it's hard to hear the person that you are talking 
to. Also I'm not sure why but this app just vanished off of my son's device 
as if he had uninstalled it, when he didn't.",
"It keeps popping up and saying it's in sleep mode. Ok I get it. Then sleep 
and stop bugging me.",
"To many pop up ads literally every minute for kids. Just bait for kids some 
ads are not even age appropriate. Get rid of the ads",
"Would be a great app, but only allows rear facing camera. Also, should 
allow call option without video.",
"Needs update. When my daughter sends the stickers where hearts float up she 
wonders why it doesnt send hearts up on hers.",
"It's lame that my son can send gifs but when I'm on my phone talking to him 
I can't. That's the fun part of messenger. Basically he has all the fun 
stuff of regular messenger but the people that chat with him don't.",
"So good, addictive, and amazing. I get a new filter almost every day",
I love it. It is the best app in the world for kids. I recoend u get it,
Cant hear anyone we call,
I think it's pretty good,
"Gave access to all my contacts in Facebook, not just those I setup",
It's very cool,
I love it so much,
I love thisüòçüòç,
"ITS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ FOR

This is so fun,
I love it,
Cool,
Not cool,
Loving it,
Love it,
Aaaaammmmaaaaaazing,
I hate it so much,
My daughter is loving it!,
I think this app is awesome,
This is the Best game ever,
"Insignia tablet NS-P11A8100 front facing camera is very dark. Sunlight is 
needed to cast persons face. Please update!",
It is awesome,
"I can not find out how to add contacts. If anyone finds out, I would love 
to know.",
"Works great! Create a child account on you main Facebook account, and then 
just install this on your child's device and sign in. Then approve or 
reject contacts they find on their device with your device, and it's all 
set. Easy.",
"I think the app is ok but its needs fixing. I can't add any new contacts. 
The only contact my daughter has are the ones I added before the app was 
ready to use. she continuously sends me request and to no avail I can't 
approve any of them. It's says find contact and then nothing...",
Please fix. Keeps telling me to try again.,
"Cannot add contacts & my ""friends list"" is not complete.",
I like the app i helps me alotüëåüëåüëåüëå,
It needs improvement I'm uninstalling it,
I can let my sis chat with me in messengerüòÜ,
"I can finally get to talk to my friend leo that lives farr 
awayüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÉüòÉüòÉ",
Owo,
"I have this friend her name is Christine and she lives around the world 
FARRRR AWAY from me and I can talk to her on this so I'm happy",
I hate this app üòêüòêüòêüòêüòê,
E best,
Its awesome,
I love it,
love in it,
It is just a texting app,
Like it,
"I love the idea of this app my only problem and the only reason why I 
didn't give it a five-star is for the fact that since I've downloaded it 
it's been crashing and won't let my daughter message people on her list",
So far I like the app. My only complaint is that I have gotten 3 messages from Messenger Kids stating that my child has sent a message that was automatically removed because it might go against Facebook's community standards. And that I might want to talk to my child about it. 1. How am I supposed to talk to my child when I have no idea what he sent because it was removed? 2. My child is an 8-year-old autistic child who cannot read. He has no idea what he sent.  Please send us parents the messages that you are automatically removing so we know what to talk to our children about!,
"It was great until we got kicked out and it won't let us log in. I've been 
trying all day",
"Id give this app 5 stars if it had the pop up chatheads and notification 
sounds when they got a new message. It would be perfect then!",
"Installed and when I tried to authorize the devices, says it isn't 
available for my region. Well, you should have information displayed on the 
Play Store install page!",
"Idc about this my parantes know I have Facebook because they let me have 
Facebook",
"I installed this on my son's tablet and it works well I would give 5 stars 
if there was notifications or if someone could tell me how to turn them on",
I wish I could have there messages sent to me,
It is a little hard to set it up,
Don't appreciate having to connect through facebook,
I'm 8 and this is awesome it's cool üòéüòéüòçüòçüòçüòçüòòüòÜüòâüòâüòâ,

Problem logging on,
It is to cool,
Amzing app,
Love it,
What is the update?!,
I just lone it,
üòçüòç,
I can keep in touch with my daughter and monitor her use. Good job!,
I cant get it to add my childs friends,
I can't get the same filters as my friend,
It is good,
Ok,
"Lame. Daughter having issues with her msgs being removed because they ""may 
violate"" some term when they are simply drawings on pictures. Nothing 
inappropriate or offensive yet each time she uses the app she comes to me, 
crying, because one of her pictures she has drawn on has been removed.",
"I think this app is great but a little problem I have coming from my point 
of view which I am a child it bothers me that the app doesn't have a speech 
bubble that pops up and the games like for basketball and soccer aren't 
there but I sent it to my dad and he could do it on his Messenger.",
"I was waiting and super excited when the app became available but it 
freezes on every call my daughter makes",
"LOVE IT!!!Get this app best app for kids but kid users my mom set it up so 
it goes to her device who I want to have on her and she can regect it love 
it though",
Can you make up a prank one Pike so if I take the somebody Texas somebody say about word to say ash,
"Ever since I got this for my 3 kids it is awesome they can only text family 
and friends",
Amazing I can be on both at the same time,
Won't even open up,
It is alsome to use and safer than messenger,
I Love it great use for kids ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,
Can you add more filters for video chatting and pictures please?,
It's fun,
Nice,
:„Äã,
Why isnt it available in my region yet???????????????????????????????????????????     ?,
Its ok but  it has no manners bc my friend is trying to download it now at 2:35 April 7th 2018 learn to download,
It sleeps so it goes offline and i don't get messages. I can't add my sister who has only a regular messenger account but no Facebook.,
It is pretty great. But I am having an issue with the sound. The speaker phone isn't working I can hear the person only through the ear speaker which takes away from wanting to use the video call.,
This is a great app overall. I just think the contacts setup looks kind of stupid. Other than that it's fine!,
Parents control who they contact/friends with. Awesome way Instead of ur child having a phone number etc..strangers... Love it so far for my 11 yo,
"This is amazimg. Kids love it and so do i. I love that i control everything 
when it comes to who they are talking to. And they love the filters.",
I love the app works great and let's me talk to family and friends its amazing,
App needs to rotate with device.,
Can you add a unsend button to unsend a message.,
It's the best,
i love this app,
I love this,
Love it,
"For younger kids, the option to block video camera, and voice recording is crucial and important. Younger kids may not understand the consequences that their parents'  may suffer should the children take pictures that others may find inappropriate. They are too young for this feature. Even if a parent had to approve all outgoing messages from their child, the child's messages are already in the Facebook cloud. I chose to disable the app permissions to camera and recording in the system settings.",
"The concept of this app is amazing but there's something wrong with the photo filters and video calling. Filters won't work at all and the video calling is one sided, as in we can see the other party but they cannot see us. Please fix.",
I updated with recent update and my son can see the person he is calling but they cant see him. We cant make outgoing calls on this app as it immediately closes the call without ringing. Please fix this my son enjoys the filters,
Work fine then video chat just stopped working   she can see them but then they can't see her. Please fix this,
"Loud, high pitched sounds during calls. One person can see the other but one can not. Will update my review once app is fixed",
Got this for my son it worked for a few days now his video isn't working he can see us but no one can see him please resolve this issue what's the point of a video app with no video,
I just downloaded the app for my daughter and when we tried to video chat someone we could see them but they could not see us... It would be nice to have it resolved  so we can utilize the app fully.,
Was fine until video quit working. My daughter can see who she is calling but they cant see her.,
I can't even get to the 3 part of getting this dume thing to work I don't have a Facebook page am only 10 I was really looking forward to texting my friendsüò´üëø,

"its crashing alot my daughter can only see her contacts. she cant read , video chat, nor send msg. please fix asap. i would love for her to use this",
On my daughters Samsung tablet it closes down everytime she clicks on a person to message. Please fix I'd really like her to be able to use it!,
"I can't even register my kids name. Everytime it asks for my kids name, I click the spot to type and the entire screen goes white. This is so frustrating.",
Cant screen set up on my daughter's phone. Ugh,
Can't video chat with my kids cause on both devices it doesn't connect to the internet. Good idea. Just doesn't work at all.,
"Love the idea, but I cant even put their name in. The screen goes completely white and when i press back it logs out. When all the bugs have been worked out it will be good.",
"Having the same problem as others, every time my daughter tries to use the app, it crashes. Fix this please, Facebook!",
"I am also having the same issue where the app crashes as soon as you click on a message to type back. I love the idea and would like my daughter to be able to use it, please fix!!",
App crashes as soon as you touch a message :/,

Constantly crashes,
Its awsome,
this app is awesomeeeeeee,
"I really like this app, BUT, use more kid friendly filters (not all kids are the same and there's some that scare my daughter. She understands the basic use, but not everything can be explained right her). Also, her older sister only uses Messenger now and it kind of sucks she can't use it with her. Fix things up and it will be perfect!",
Does not work. Messages don't come in and when they do its very delayed and skips some. Fix it! Just does not work. Only when I call  them ut not when they call me,
"I like the app, my only complaint at this point is the lack of notifications. My kid receives messages but never knows because there are no notifications.",
I as a parent like this app as it makes it easy for others to be reachable by my child.  However it's not compatible with his older phone so he can only use it on his tablet.  Would love to see that changed.  His phone isn't that old.,
"Parents can only approve friends who have a FB account, but if they only have a FB Messenger account, they can't be added. It's alright for a start but needs work.",
Love you very much baby I want you to think bout the money from your website and thank goodness for you to come over at my place if I have to say I don't think so much more than the same thing as the update on the link below to get started in the best way possible to go to bed early tonight and I will be able to go back and get a good deal for me to see personally I think that it is the best way to go back in my life that I really truly do care,
"Can't message anyone or answer anyone. My son loves video chatting with family, please fix this",
I would of gave u more star üåüüåüüåüI only gave u 3 because my parents can see who and what's text to ppl but other than that I can contact more of my family they mostly all have facebook and messenger,
"It lets you video call people, but when we try to message, the screen turns white and then brings me to he home screen. Please fix it.",
"It's pretty good, but my daughter is having problems with video chat. She can see us, but we can't see her. So disappointing. It worked properly to start with. üòï",
I need to be able to send gifs to my nephew but as of now he can only send them to me,
"IT SAYS "" this is not available in your region at the time"" LIKE ITS STUPID!!",
I love because you can keep the phone number that you already have like you do not have to change my phone number,
Can the students add the people pretty please,
It says.nit available in your rigon,
I absolutely love it! It is sooo fun.,
I thought it was amazing even when you are far away  from someone that you miss  it is not fair how the parents can get messenger than now the children can get messenger for kids,
Ttid I don't know,
I hate this app can't even log in,
I would like it to be avaliable worldwibe to everyone,
I love it becaouse i    could talk to my mom,
Me and my mommy loved it üòÄ,
Doesn't even work,
"I can't even log in at all it's says ""it's not for you'r country yet""",
"Camera rotation is broken on the Galaxy Tab A. What is this, 2012?",

Crashes a lot!!!,
My daughter loves this apps,
Love it!,
Hate it.,
I live in California and the developer info is based in California as well. Why is it not available in my area??,
BEST APP EVER,
I love it,
Great for kids,
I call  my  cusen,
DON'T DO IT,
It's ok,
I like it,
Have had this for my 12yo for a couple days now.  I like that I can control who he talks to. and that he doesn't have to have a FB account to use the app. I finally figured out how to monitor his messages... download the app to MY device as well.  It didn't get 5 stars from me because of the frustration of trying to figure out how to see his conversations and asking for his friends parents permission to be added without accidentally adding the parent instead.,
I would give  more stars of I could edit added contacts. I want  to remove an accidentally added contact. I am unable to do so.,
Trying to figure out how to check her activity etc. And also can't find away to add her father so that he can monitor as well.,
"I love the app so far. It needs to let my kids choose their profile picture, out of their phone gallery.",
Needs the ability to delete inappropriate emjois and scary/creepy masks. If it's for 6 year olds then it needs to be kid friendly for that age!,
Its awesome. It should have a commercial. Someone do that right now.üò†,
I love this app cause I can talk to my tios and tia's Yay and I can actually hear my tia's when we face time it freeze like 2 times but that's ok!,
My husband works oil and this app is perfect for our son to be able to talk to him whenever he wants!,
I dont know my face book password,
Lots of fun with the mask. My son loves it!,
I love this app now i can call all my family with out getting FaceBook,
i think its great for kids :3,
My daughter loves it!,
Oi love it so much,
My child can't reply to messages she receives from me. And I'm the one who created her account and added her friends.,
"Thoughtful and really fun! Did a 4 way group video call this evening with my daughter, her best friend and her best friend's parents!",
"Very good idea, the app on testing...",
Love the stickers!,
It is a great social experience platform that lets your child practice responsibility for if and when they get a phone. My kid loved it and yours will too,
This app need me to login. I don't know why it won't let me in,
"I liked it but will probably not be using it since I had already opened a 
fb account for my son and simply set it to private with no friend requests. 
Then I opened the regular messenger account and he and his friend (that I 
added) and family can video chat and play games. I wanted to try this one 
to see if it'd be the same but easier to supervise but this one doesn't 
have the games and he can't just use his already private account. But nice 
try and thanks for the attempt.",
"Needs improving. The only people you can add are people on your friends 
list. I don't want my ex mother in law on my friends list just so my kids 
can talk to her. As long as they want to talk to people you are friends 
with though it's great. My daughter spends tons of time talking to her 
cousins. And unlike some of the other apps I don't have to worry about 
creepers on here.",
"I really want to love this app... But it only uses my Facebook contacts for 
my daughter's friend options, it won't let my add my mom and sister who 
only have Messenger, no Facebook. If it would let me use my Messenger 
contacts as well then I would definitely give it a 5 star! I added it just 
so she could talk to family and video chat but without my Messenger's 
contacts it's pointless!",
"Help help help me please! Both my daughters love it because they can talk 
to their friends and their family members. I like it because they don't 
have to have a Facebook account to associate with it. I like it because 
it's secure and I can keep track of who they're actually having 
conversations with based on who I approve. The only issue I have is somehow 
my one daughter's account blocked her friend and I don't know how to get 
then back.",
"Love that I can talk to my kids when I'm at work but don't like that there 
are no parental controls after they have it. Cant change who they can talk 
to after you allow them to have contact. Need to have a parent app that 
let's you see all and change things at any time",
Very bad. I downloaded on both phones and the camera didn't work on either phones for this app even though it worked in the other end and i can see the other person... I give 1 star because i cant give 0. Horrible app... Don't waste your time.,
"This worked great for one whole day then it logged out and it kept saying 
it couldn't authorize the device. I couldn't sign in on my phone or my 
tablet. I tried restarting and uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing 
worked. It's frustrating because it was a good app which my daughter super 
enjoyed and now it wont work. Sounds like this problem is happening to 
quite a few people from reading reviews. Fix the glich.",
"My husband is away on business for a month and he wants to be able to chat 
with our 10 year old when he can't speak on the phone. My husband has sent 
him a message, but every time my son clicks it says ""something went wrong"" 
and he cannot see the message from his father. It worked fine for a few 
hours and my son loved and was so excited that he was able to keep in touch 
with his best guy throughout the day! Now all I see is him trying to 
refresh the app hoping his dads message will pop up! Very disappointed!!!",
"Teach your kids that its OK to be spied on and monitored and have all your 
information reviewed by the authoritive figures in their lives for their 
own safety and security so they will become model obedient citizens during 
our impending cyberdystopian future. Why teach kids to lock the door, and 
to protect their identity when you're right there doing it for them? Teach 
them to be careful what they say and to not truly embrace their most honest 
thoughts as they are never truly theirs. Allow it instead to build in their 
unconscious as they grow up in their most formative years devoid of all the 
things you suddenly expect them to demand and comprehend as an adult 
despite never truly experiencing it for themselves, and if they have, only 
because they had to work around the rules, making honest, private 
communication, immediately dishonest by default. ""Messenger: for Parents"" 
There's an entire person in there. Take it away, one message at a time. <3",
"Keeps giving an error message and my daughter is a little upset about it. 
I'm irritated that it does that because all the content disappears and i 
can't see who she's been messaging. I can also see that it's flashing 
because someone has messaged her and, like i said, she's upset that she 
can't see what they said because of an error. Also, she's upset that she 
doesn't get a chat head bubble like i do.",
"Horrible can't receive notifications unless i call my son when I write him 
his phone does not make a sound. He can't see my messages unless he opens 
the app THUMBS DOWN",
"It's a great app to contact your friends and family, it's easy to use and your parent can completely control how you use it. The parent can control the people you talk to, both kids parents have to approve the person. You can't delete your messages so your parents can see everything you message. This app is great I 10/10 recommend this app.",
"Always says it's not available in my region at this time. Because of that, 
I can't even get passed logging into the Facebook account. Very 
infuriating. My daughter and I do not plan to get again unless we get some 
sort of explanation and the issue is resolved.",
"Downloaded it on my daughters phone and it keeps saying logging out. Also 
when I try to verify it says error I've changed my password many times and 
still nothing. I'll change my rating when it gets fixed",
"I love that you can better monitor the younger kids on Facebook. My niece 
and nephew (now old enough for Facebook) had accounts since 10 and they 
know nothing of internet dangers. I love that now there's a better 
alternative.",
"Won't load,just flashes a white screen and closes. I've tried to reinstall but does the same thing",
"The app will not let me approve on my kids device it just keeps saying 
wrong number or email. Was a great app till this",
"Except for the glitch with trying to approve a recent friend request, we 
love it! I can't delete the request or approve it - I want to approve it, 
but I can't do anything with it. üôÅ but other than that I feel like it's a 
safe app for my 11 year old to stay connected with family and a couple 
friends.....",
"Use to work great but now everyone someone sends her a message it comes to 
my phone and not hers. Same with the video calls.",
"Works for a few days then stops completely. Looks like I'm not the only one 
with these problems. Fix your stuff.",
"This app was working great up until recently. Every time my son clicks on a message to open it kicks him out, this is how he communicates with his dad overseas. Please fix.",
"Video call isn't working, no answer from Facebook as usual. Really upsetting they make something for kids but do a half assed job of it and then don't answer back requests to fix their app",
"It's not the best app ever but it is still good. Butt make it just a little 
better.",
"It will not allow me to authorize so I can't use it. Worst app I've 
encountered. And no help from the support team .",
"It's a nice idea. I haven't gotten it to work yet, though. It keeps giving 
an error or logging out when I try to set it up on her android phone.",
It is best app for me.Because i m 10years old.and through messenger kids i chat with my frndz.So i suggest u all to install such app. Thnxss,
"Cannot get the app to open on our Android tablet. It just keeps looking like it's going to load, restarting, looking like it's going to load, over and over and never actually starts.",

It never let me verify my FB to get her started. Kept telling me it wasnt a registered account but then I used the same info and logged right on my FB from the web. But it still kept saying the same thing. A waste of space so I deleted it.,

Perfect for kids. No games built in like the regular one has which is great.,

can have face book and he can install regular messager if he wants. He can 
even use mine if he get my permission.",
Its a great app. And I love how you can video call multiple people at the same time,
"You need to stop puting to creat a facebook account because I was hoping to 
love this app but this sucksüëé",

Gmail Messenger should try to stop hackers from hacking and having Packers falsifying photos and pretending to be other people which is very very hackable I keep reporting to you stop these f****** hackers I'm going to reach you with it too until you get better and few people are being hacked and you're not having the right identification and these people are asking us for our photo licenses so they can get their pictures to be licensed that's a f****** hack right there and you know it,
"So I love it my friend can't have real mess anger BC her parents Tot

"Perfect for my daughter who is obsessed with Facebook but to young to have

I really think this messaging app is the best for kids you don't see any bad things,
It's so kid friendly I love it I suggested that they are good apps to free video call but I like this one,
My mom can see every thing I do so she trusts me,

I love it because my friend Delores couldn't call me on real text so she and I used this,
It's great but I don't have Facebook account so that's sad and neither does my mom,
I downloaded it on my laptop but it wont let me use it but it says its compatible,
"It is the coolest thing I will ever get and you can use it any ware you 
want and for you will love it so much.",
i dont like this app beacuse its not avalibe in all regions,
It tells me it cant find my face book acount,
It's great I got to talk to my mom she talked back,
Have not Played It I Will See How I like it or not :),
OMG I LOVE THIS BECAUSE THISIS ACTUALLY FOR KIDS SO I CAN TALK!TO MY FRIENDS WHEN I WANNA,
"I get to stay in touch with my family and friends. When we are so far away. 
I love this app!",
I hate it keeps glitching out and my child has been cursing all day and more on there,
All i know is that when i tried to get on it kicked me off stupid Facebook,
I love it it is my name is zarrionas I am 10 gets OLD how old are You,
I think it's a little more than what I thought it was good for my grandkids,
I Love this app it's so so if my mum or dad is not with me.i can call them,
My son loves it but now we can't get his  messages it just kicks us out of app,
"Well it was a good idea but first off opened the app started to log it in 
for my child and 3 hours of ads started, one would get to 2 seconds before 
I could close it and start a new one!!! Complete trash!!!",
I like it because you can do so many things that's why I like it,
I am not allowed to have Facebook cuz I will get in big trouble and some of my families have been hacked and I don't want that to happen to me so u guys shouldn't have to include Facebook!,
I mean it's okay but you could do better because I had normal messenger and it said I need a phone number is have one but I don't call or text that much why not username or gmail?....,
"I like everything about it, and im well over 8. I just hate how u can't choose your profile picture from photos! U have to take it on the spot! (So I took a picture of another phones screen so I could have a filter;-)) Also, u can't send links, which, whatever. Everything else tho, üëç",
I love it for my kids. But I think that you should make it so parents can see the message treads. Sometime the people who do bad things to kids are not always strangers.,
"It would be nice if I could sign in. Says to authorized by signing in your 
parental account first but every time I do that, it tells me there's an 
error something went wrong please fix!?.. Thanks.",
I do not like how parents can view ur messages... yep back to Snapchat...but I love the features and everything...great app for kids 10 and younger... I think this was not meant for tweens lol,
It is great i can contact family without danget i love it,
Why messenger kids doesn't work in Iraq!,
"This app worked well for. Couple days. Now, video chatting won't work, 
conversations won't load. It's just not working as it should and it's kinda 
frustrating. Also, there is no help to be found. C'mon Facebook, you can do 
better.",
To: echo blood it doesn't work on tablets,
"Omg this saved m6 life!!! I used it to connect w/ my mom because she left 
me to babysit without telling!!!",
It's a safe way for my daughter to message me and others I deem ok!,

"It's cool I love it I know it's awesome(says sarcastically)just uhhhh it's 
UNBELIEVABLE",
Its really helpful my kid cant talk with her friends alot so she uses this,
"I..like the last few users am experiencing not being able to log back 
on...when are u going to fix this glitch?",
Asom me and my mom can be together when she is at work,
Because I like to text my mom aunt and family,
Safe to out up for kids without allowing them on fb,
This app is so cool I want to have it for myself,
My mom download it and I think its very fun,
