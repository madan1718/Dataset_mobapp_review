Review Text,Category
"Amazing. My son has been struggling with recognizing and identifying letters for a while. I hate to use apps as a teaching replacement, but this was amazing. The first couple words he struggled with, but each word he got way better. I also like the words used, because they're not necessarily the typical ""a is for apple"" things. One thing that I think would help this be worth the $8.99 is if the definition always played. For $8.99 it should have another activity too.",
"Amazing on all fronts! Nice sounding voices, adorable animations, makes learning fun and engaging like it should be, no propaganda or weird content, teaches phonics and makes it fun! My 3&1/2 year old took to it like a duck in water and it's definitely going to help with early reading skills and it has some very hard words in it. But you know it's good when you hear a toddler whisper words like ""stupendous"" under his breath. Definitely worth the $9.",
"My autistic 3 year old loves this app! What a wonderful learning tool. Got to give it up to the developers, you can tell that they geared it with the right amount of work to reward ratio stimulus. Complete the word - get the little video animation. My kid even skips to the next word immediately after the video ends haha. Only criticism is make the ""Home"" button require a long hold or double tap to prevent unintentional touching.",
"I paid for the full version, but my son has gotten bored with the same exact words. I wish it had a pool of different words that changed periodically. I also noticed that you released a newer version of this app called endless reader where I have to pay for the full version again.",
"Well I am impressed. I purchased full version within 15 minutes of trying it. Frustration free game play and learning for my 2.5 year old. That just hasn't happened using any other game we've tried. There's always sticking points where he would begin melting down because he couldn't figure out how to get past it. This one has none of that. Even if he's struggling with a letter he will keep trying till he gets it, then clap with the monsters when he gets it. It's a great little game!",
"We love this app! My ONLY issue is, there seems to be something going on with the sound. At least half of the times we open the app, the sound doesn't work, if it does work, it cuts out while my daughter is playing. This is fixed by restarting the tablet, but is definitely not something we should have to do after paying $11 or so for the app, especially when the sound is half the reason we love it so much.",
"Such a fantastic game! Our two year old has learned so much from it, especially sounding out letters. We generally never allow screen time, but we make an exception with this app, and with endless numbers. An app really has to be amazing to balance out the negative qualities of screen time, if your going to let your toddler use an app let it be this one.",
"WENT TO COLLEGE FOR education. This app and the # 1 are IT! This is precisely it! My opinion is that this app absolutely will catch childs attention, entertain &educate fast! The letters give phonetical tones in a silly & fun way to make large vocab WORDS. Monsters are rich &colorful. High quality animations with silly stories. MOST apps are cheaply made and req. a subscription FOR cheap quality, horribe sound, cut and paste powerpoint, no character depth, inaccurate &NO PERSONALITY. 10/10!",
"Bought the app and it did not work right off the bat! I enabled storage permissions, tried reinstalling, etc-nothing helped. Once the letters of the word are put back in place it just goes to a blank screen instead of playing the animation associated with that word. My 4 year old is extremely disappointed and so am I for wasting money on an app that doesn't work!",
It's fixed! I finally got a email response and they helped me out. It would have been nice if they had a message when you purchase to make sure you stay on the app ( don't close the app out) also make sure that you don't have screensaver mode on. So leave the app open and no screensaver. Give it about 10 mins to download.,
This app seemed very buggy to me at first and was giving me disc space warnings when I had downloaded the extension pack. It was all due to the fact that storage permissions were not turned on and it no point in the installation did it ask me to approve storage permissions. This seems like a bit of an oversight and it certainly going to piss anybody off like me after purchasing a $9 upgrade and then not being able to use it. I wish that the error messages were a little more explicit and helpful.,
"I was trying to find cute ABC app for my kid, but most part of them are extremely vibrant and be honest ugly. 😃 I've started to develope my own app instead. Now, when it's almost finished, I accidentally have found your app. It's amazing! I'm very impressed by the design, sound effects and animations. Now I'm jealous. Good job, guys!",
"My kids are both autistic and love this app. I've already bought it twice though. When I get a new phone and redownload the app all of the words are gone? Most apps I've paid for *automatically* include the paid features when I reinstall them on a new phone, others have a button to verify the purchase. This app does neither. I've purchased multiple apps from this company but having to repurchase each time instead of the app just verifying is ridiculous, especially for nine dollars.",
"Love the words and sounds the app uses, but its too sensitive. if child touches the screen a certain way it leaves the screen/word the child is working on and when they go back in the word they have to start all over again instead of app remembering where they left off. This is frustrating and discouraging for the child, esp. if the child is special needs and their fingers and wrists dont work the same way. Endless numbers and Endless wordplay apps are not as sensitive and much better at this.",
"Since my kids love the Endless Numbers game, I had to purchase this games as well. My kids are only 2 & 1 right now they both love playing as well as watching others play this game. My kids really love the animations as well as the puzzle aspect. All the games by this developer are worth the investment. I highly recommend purchasing this games as well as the other.",
I thought this app was going to be amazing and loved the 7 free words with the animated reinforcement of the words definition. As soon as I purchased the app though the reinforcement animations disappeared. I'm giving the app 2 stars because I still think it does a great job with letter recognition and the sound each letter makes just wish the animations would have stayed. Update: I signed in the next day and everything wad working perfectly. Been a week so far and my 2 year old lives this app,
"There are issues with some that dont have the animations after you add the letters. I saw a review that said it restart would fix it, i did, and it worked the first time. However, words after that and restarts after that, its still not working.",
"All of the ""Endless..."" games we've tried (Alphabet, Reader, Wordplay, and Numbers) try to appeal to both younger learners and older - honestly, not always successfully. However, Endless Alphabet is the best of the bunch for young learners, and in my opinion, well worth the money. The free trial version is entirely representative of the full game. This is how it works: a word appears on the screen (say Gargantuan). Each letter has a different appearance/color. When you pick it up, makes the sound that matches its position in that particular word (hard ""G-G-G""s for gargantuan, but a soft ""G"" in some other words). The monsters run by and ""knock off"" and scramble the letters from the word. The child needs to place the letters back into their spots (in any order). When the letter is placed correctly, it makes its name sound (""Gee!""). Once the word is filled in, there's a cartoon illustrating the word, and the narrator speaks the definition. What this app does well for young learners - capital letter recognition matching, learning names of letters, teaching of basic consonant sounds - it does VERY VERY well. The animations of each letter, and the cute monster cartoons for the vocabulary words (more for older learners) keep the younger ones engaged. The adult that occasionally plays along may find it somewhat enjoyable too. :-) Our 3.5 was allowed to play it 2 times a week for 10-40 minutes each, and had a decent grasp of all of the above after 1 month, and a good grasp after 2 months. Now he calls out the letters (by their sounds) he sees in street signs and around the house. He loves the cartoons, but is not really picking up the vocabulary. That's all right - still worth it. The weaknesses of the game come from 1. the utter screwiness of the English language and 2. from trying to appeal to different ages. Note that Endless Wordplay and Reader do address some of these - but again, those apps also suffer from trying to appeal to different age groups, with their own issues. Perhaps as a separate app, ""Alphabet - The Next Generation"", focusing on both letters and phonics, and aimed just at younger learners, might be considered? (Similar to how there is Dragonbox Algebra 5+ and Dragonbox Algebra 12+?) 1. The letters can be dropped into the word in any order. It would help younger learners if the letters could only be dropped in left to right (similarly to a done in either Reader or Wordplay - can't remember which.) 2. Because words are long, they can have multiples of the same vowel, with different sounds. So in ""BETWEEN"", 2 letters make an ""ee"" sound and 1 makes a ""eh"" sound - but they can be dropped in anywhere. That's an issue with the language more than this game, and the only way I can see to fix it is to ""stick"" EE together so it would be dropped into the word as a unit. That would not work well here, as it would make the step of speaking the letter name confusing. Hence the suggestion for ""Alphabet - the next generation"" ;-) 3. Building on the above, combined sounds (""th/ph/ch/sh"") could be taught if 2 letters could stick together. Same for combined vowels. Limitations aside, this is a well-thought through game, and we've paid for it twice (on both android and kindle). Recommend.",
"Nice, but the little skits are not playing after the word is put back together. Can someone help and fix this problem? I paid for the entire app. I am looking to purchase other products but, may not if this issue doesn't get resolved. I have submitted the issue to the email you gave. Waiting on a response.",
"I love this app and so does my 2 year old who has been learning new words and letters. i hate that it doesnt have family sharing when you purchase the full app. I bought it on my tablet but cant get it on my phone,Id have to pay again. Second issue I have is I feel like a couple of the letter sounds are off. I wish they where a little better bi5 otherwise a great app.",
"I absolutely LOVE this app! I've downloaded the Learning Academy for my iPad, and the Endless Alphabet app for both my iPad and Android. It is helping my 3-year-old with Autism learn to read. He echoes the sound that the letters make and then says, ""I'm a ""insert letter matching the sound he's making."" He also points out letters on signs and food boxes. Definitely worth it!",
"Hands down- this is the best kids app we've ever had. We have used it for years. Every time we get a new phone or tablet, we download this app. My 4 yr old learns her letters an when my 9 yr old plays with her, she learns the meaning of words that she didn't know before. It couldn't be more perfect! (And I'm super picky.)",
"Problem is resolved and app is really great nice graphics, words, fun vocals and very entertaining so kids won't get bored. It really shows a lot of effort and thought went into creating this app. Would recommend to everyone. Keep up the good work and I hope more words or more apps are added.",
"I still wish there were high frequency words in the app but I can see the thought process behind why there aren't. My daughter loves this app. It is easily her favorite. She is just over 2.5 and is already displaying a preschool/kindergarten level of identification, sound to letter correspondence, pronunciation, and vocabulary. As a previous teacher and stay at home dad I am a big advocate of expanding your child's vocabulary early and using correct pronunciation.",
I can't believe how much this works. My 2 year old had been having issues speaking more than just one or two words. Trying to expand his vocal rang had been so challenging. I turned to the internet for help. Saw how much games inspired children and so I searched the app store for a few. This one by far is worth the money.,
"Wish there were different age levels to choose for this and being able to ""level up"". names of letters/sounds of letters/sounding out words/reading shirt sentencea/long sentences. (i know theres the reading app but thats a big step up.) The words are pretty big for my son (2.5). He loves the numbers app and matching but also seems like a big jump from learning numbers to learning addition right away.",
"I've used this app for 6 years or so between my 4 children. I love the simplicity that there aren't tons of other bells and whistles and ""rewards"". It's just very well made, enough to keep all ages engaged. I feel this app was foundational to phonics and is why my olders have excelled at language arts. I recommend it!",
"I discovered Originator Kids on YouTube for my child two years ago, and it is because of them that he is an advanced reader now, in kindergarten. I finally installed one of the apps and he is having a lot of fun doing everything himself. This is especially nice because he knows all the characters already after a long time of just watching the app being played on YouTube. I had a downloading issue, but it was solved right away. Everyone was exceptionally nice and helpful.",
Extremely educational yet entertaining so it makes spelling and letter recognition a game!  One issue is that I paid for the software for my android phone and just got an iPhone.  When I tried to load the software on my new phone it wanted me to pay again. I use it for my grandkids learning experience.  I don’t want to have to pay for it again.,
"We absolutely adore this app! It's helped my toddler learn her letters and she has so much fun with it. It also makes me laugh, too. 3 starts because it is intelligible for Google family library which means I bought a copy, dad has to buy a copy, and we have to buy a copy for her tablet if she wants it on all devices. Please fix this problem. The game is phenomenal. I have purchased some other games by you all as well before I realized we couldn't use them across family devices.",
"I paid for full unlock. It worked just fine, but when I installed it in my daughter's new phone, it won't download the full version. No restore option. UPDATE: as suggested by developer, i left the phone on download for 10-15 mins and i kept the display on. Downloaded perfectly and my daughter is delighted!!! Thankyou developer for responding fast to my email.",
My kid loves it. He had very delayed speech and still working on it. But he can spell every word on this game with ease. I absolutely don't mind him having screen time if it's this game. He adores it. It would be awesome if we could add our own words to it. Like names. That would definitely be helpful in using this as a learning aid. Thank you.,
"i purchased these for my computer on windows...and they want me to buy it again for my android tablet, and then yet again for an iphone. at $8.99 per game thats $27.00! Dont even waste your time! I emailed them and explained and they said I had to re-purchase for each platform! Most developers will credit you once you have paid for them once...what a shame I kind of liked this game, but not for $27.00",
"Unfortunately in-app purchase is required to access full alphabet, this prevents use with Google Play Family Library meaning purchases can not be shared between multiple devices. If you have multiple kids and multiple devices you will likely find this simply too expensive. Have to admit the app itself is great and children seems to love it. Sincerely hope developer will reconsider functionality with family library, then I would be more comfortable to recommend to family & friends.",
"This is a fantastic learning game for kiddos. But it is not available for the family share, which means my daughter cannot play the full paid version on her Google account on her tablet. Please consider making this available for families to use considering the cost of this app is on the higher end. I would update this to 5 stars otherwise. Edit: I changed my review to 5 stars because their support team was super helpful at fixing the issue for me.",
"My 4 yo autistic son who is non verbal loves this app. It allows him to drag and drop the letters and goes into a cute cartoon explaining the meaning of the word. My only complaint is that the words are way too advanced for him. I need him to learn words like happy and sad, or up and down. Instead it gives us words like portrait and demolish and instead of smelly, its odor. Basic words would be nice, or even the option for an expansion or add on that could include them.",
"There isn't the option to set the 'description' of the letters to phonics so I don't see how useful this app is, my 5yr old is learning the way a letter sounds in reading so this app just confused things. If there were a phonics audio option, this would be perfect.",
"I really like this app for my kids. It is so interactive and cute. However noticed the ""r"" and ""m"" sounds are incorrect. This may lead to confusion when learning to read later on. Just FYI, I am work as an ELL instructor to teach you kids to read and phonological awareness is kind of my jam.",
"Really like this app for my daughter, but I bought it on my wife's phone and it won't play on my daughter's tablet or my phone. Was expecting to be able to buy the app once, not have to buy it for every device. Edit: developer's reached out to help, great customer service.",
"The bad: does regularly crash on initial load. Also a few poor word choices. Please strongly consider removing scary and nightmare. Now my two year old has decided he is ""afraid"" of things and has struggled with bedtime 🧐. The good: helps your kid learn phonetics really well, entertaining videos, just please switch out the few words mentioned above!",
"Great for my 2 year old son. Educational, cute, and best of all, no ads. Worth the full version. There are minor bugs, but restarting the app fixes them.",
"My kids think it's hilarious and it makes them excited to learn. I love that the letters make their own sound when you touch them. Fun, cute and not annoying. I'm picky about my kids' shows and games and this is one we've used for nearly 5 years.",
"Really love those Endless series. However, thesedays some app developers making Android and Apple devices can share the purchases instead paying again for different OS based devices. Could you consider of this for the customers please? It would make me feel more comfortable to buy full versions of many other apps of you. Thank you for great apps :)",
Great for toddlers to school age children for phonetic alphabet and learning a great range of words. We've noticed a huge difference over the past few weeks in recognition and understanding of words and letter. Will purchase further apps.,
"me and my toddler both adore this game. Well made, very educational, and fun for her! Definitely worth buying the full game. On a tablet, sometimes the app audio stops and it has to be force closed to get it to work again, but i dont think its made for tablets so thats alright.",
Horrible ! I got this app it was so fun but only went up to the letter C unless you pay for the whole endless alphabet . So i went and got a google play card paid the $10 and after that it kept saying no room for download and then just stopped working all together wont even open i tried uninstalling and reinstalling and no help ! I want a refund or for it to work as i paid for ! Who can i contact for this ?! I have already sent an email .,
My daughter loves this app and always wants to play it. There was an issue that I reached out to the support team for and still haven't received a response. The issue is fixed....still no response. If you say it takes about 1 business day for a response then you should do that.,
My toddler loves this game but the home button is in such an inconvenient spot. He hits the home button allllllll the time losing his progress. Maybe put it in the middle or give a prompt instead of just returning home.,
"i love this app so much i have bought it twice. once for my windows tablet and again for my android device. I have had it on windows for over a year, but still havent gotten the update for level 3 yet. My Android device however, has all the updates and my kids love when i hook up the tablet to the tv, so i can make the screen bigger.",
This app will only work for a few words and then it stops playing the videos until you close and reopen it. Very glitchy. Also I bought the app and it didn't make a difference in that respect.,
"This is a great app. My 4 year old enjoys it, but what surprised me is that now it is my 2 year old's favorite game. It is helping him learn letters and words, while he laughs at the silly monsters. I hardly ever pay for apps, but I'm glad I purchased this one!",
"my son loves this. really helps with letter recognition and sounding out as well as vocabulary. I had to reach out to support with a question, happy to say got a fast response, fast resolution and very professional and polite support. will be purchasing their other products as well.",
"Truly helped my son with his letters and words when he had a hard time in prek, on other platforms and apps. This educational app feels more like a game and less like a classroom which kept my kids interested. Love it!",
"Love it! Bright colors, fun animation, sounds aren't too annoying, has really helped my kids with letter names, phonics, and vocabulary. Highly revommend.",
well the only problem with it is that you need to buy the full game. Would be 5 stars if the whole gane was free.,
"Iv'e been using this app with a friend's child who is having trouble learning letters and sounds. As a plus, they use larger words ..cooperate, courage, etc. and give visual and oral defination.",
My toddler loves this game. He's starting to get more interested in books and words and this game holds his attention longer than most. I had an issue that I emailed the developer about and they handled it perfectly. I really recommend this .,
"Great app! Some of the words are very hard for my 4yo but eventually she'll get it. Examples: famished, gargantuan, minuscule, scrumptious there's more but these words are hard.",
I would give it 5 stars but I just spent $50 to add endless alphabet and numbers to my twins tablets because you cant family share with these apps. I can see having to purchase on apple and android platforms but every device is a rip off. if they ever allow family sharing on same platform I will finish buying the rest of the series of these app cuz they are great learning apps just cost an arm and leg for all your kids to use on their own tablets.,
"Poor customer service. Paid for the full version. We got our son a new tablet. After installing, back to the free version. After talking to support, they say that it was only good for 1 device and I wouldn't have to contact Google Play Store for a refund. Poor, poor, poor",
Lack of family sharing is ridiculous. I would gladly but every single so if there's except is have to buy twice for both of my kids to use on their devices. After purchasing the first app I will not be purchasing more. Simply will uninstall if the kids are over the limited functions. Please address this.,
I paid to unlock the game a while ago. But now it's locked again?! Why?! Edit: the customer reps responded swiftly and explained the issue. It wasn't the game's fault. The game is spectacular. Thanks for helping out.,
Happy bumped into this game. So far no issues with it. Love the characters and their personalities. My toddler is learning the pronunciation and new words plus the meanings. Creative work.,
amazing app... paid full to unlock the full game... awesome app.. any time I make a sound of letters my son easily recognizes them. my 4 year daughter has recently started playing game as well she is also making great progress on recognizing letter from sound I make... thank you.. worth every penny.,
"My 20 month old adores this app! It has lovely animations and is really well designed. I've just gone and got the rest of the 'endless' apps as we love the alphabet one so much. Please make a French one too! Oh yes, and thank you for 'zed,' as we say it here :)",
"I downloaded this for fun for my three year old. It's really cute, she loves it and has been learning letters so fast. She's been naming letters she sees everywhere now. I wish it taught the lower case as well. :)",
The absolute best app I could have ever of found for my 12 month old ɓabÿ who now is 10. He can read since kindergarten and ìmpŕèssivè toò. Ĥe hàs expressìoñ and reads to the 4th ĝradeŕs when he ŵàs in 1st ĝrade.(who were there to help him read) amazing. I give it all to this app ànd it's ŵorth buying all the words!,
"My kid loves the app and the visual in you tube, but we are not going to pay 8.99 for each different letter of the alfabet. The app only gives 3 letters ABC and the rest you have to pay for each resting letter that will be $206.77 + taxes..",
"My three year old loves this. Even when I had a question about the app, customer service was exceptional. Strongly recommend buying the full thing.",
"Would be amazing if the app forced the kids to spell the word in order otherwise it's just recognising shapes. I tell her to spell the word in order but it just would be great if the app could help aid that, because when she's alone she will spell the word however she feels",
"Good game. Kid loved it. Bought the extra words. Won't download, changed to allow access like the internet said, still won't download. Uninstalled and installed multiple times and still won't download. Contacted developer and email doesn't work. 😬",
A great app. Well worth the price. Our 2year old started playing it and right away was copying the sounds and enjoying the animations as well. Wish I could find more apps this good.,
"*would highly recommend* My son was able to recite the alphabet properly from 20 months old, using this app. He's nearly 4 now and still uses this, as well as the numbers & Spanish app versions. Well worth the money to buy the full words package.",
I purchased the full set of letters the app was not working so I uninstalled and when it was reinstalled everything was gone. Is there any way to restore them? This happened with the endless reader and endless numbers to.,
"32 gigs of free space on a 128G pixel and the app is crashing, demanding more free space after cache and data clear? $8.99 wasted on sloppy development. Try harder, Originator.",
Love the way it teach them the sound and name of the letters. I also love that it teaching them vocabulary words with definition and a short video to demonstrate the definition as well.,
I love this app for my kids. It's educational and helps them learn the sounds of each letter. It's great for learning the definition of the word as well. Both my 2-year-old and 6-year-old benefit from using it.,
So much fun to play. Very captivating for our 7-yr-old. We love the letters personalities. Bought the full version as soon as we had tried it out.,
This is a great app and all my kids love to use it. I would give it 5 stars if I could add the paid version to my Family Library instead of it being tied only to my one account :( This would let the kids use it on another device so much easier,
"Great app and support! My daughter loves the silly letter sounds, I appreciate the big words it exposes her to. We had an issue with purchased content and the developers were a fantastic help.",
"I used to play this as a baby and I loved it! Now I have a baby sister and I wanted to download some apps on my phone for her. When I saw this, she loved it just as much as I did! It has no adds, and is super encouraging for my sister! She's growing so fast from the app. Thank you!",
My 3 years old and 1.5 years old both have fun using this up. It is very well designed to hold attention and teach kids while keeping them entertaining. 3 years old knows now full alphabet. I highly recommend.,
Great reading resource for my 1st grader! It is like a puzzle piece matching game but with letters that say the sounds when you click and drag them to their correct spot in the word :),
Kids loved the app...purchased full app then skits quit playing and a message popped up and closed the app. Kinda disappointing bc I usually wouldn't spend so much on an app. Thought this one would've been worth it.,
It seems like it would be nice but it's for words only not really learning the alphabet. Not as entertaining as endless numbers. I am lowering my stars because despite being an offline game for kids it is constantly eating data!!! Why!?,
"I am extremely disappointed. I paid to upgrade to more words but all of the new words do not have the skits and explanation of the word after my son completes the word. This is either a fault or, the creators are misleading us. Please tell me how this can be rectified.",
"Don't buy this until they make it a family library app. Edit- I have learned that this has something to do with google play not allowing you to add in app purchases to family library, however the developer could offer full version buying option to avoid this.",
My 2 year old loves this app! I love that she can now read words like stupendous. The ideas are genius and the animation is well done. Even my older kids laugh as the letter U goes across the screen.,
"Great reading and phonics app, truly one of a kind. However there is no way to restore purchases so if you uninstall the game, you have to buy it again.",
"I've paid for this app but I can't add this paid version to my son's user account on the same tablet. Very frustrating. There's only one Google account on this tablet, the one that paid for the app.",
"Hi. can you help me please? i bought the full package for endless abc , but the animation sometimes not showing up after the words explanation. is there something wrong? thanks for your help.",
"We loved these games, but now switching devices, I unlocked all words and numbers for both Endless Alphabet and Endless Numbers, but they WILL NOT DOWNLOAD. I spent $20+ and now I'm just stuck. What am I supposed to do? Please help.",
"Would rate this 5 stars, as my toddler loves it. However, I purchased the full version for 8.99 and I see no way to family share this game. You think of all apps to take advantage of family sharing it would be this one.",
"Terrible. Downloaded app & bought full alphabet. Still trying to ""download more words"" for the last few months. Have tried uninstalling and installing again but it still isn't working. How do i get my money back?",
"As a kid I really like this app but nowadays it is so expensive to buy for the full version but this is not so much ""Endless"" for me and please MAKE IT FREE. No buying for the full version I need the full version I am poor. But this is just trash.",
I did loved this app ever since I got a new phone I lost all my sons words that I paid for and now it's saying I have to rebuy it..? I want this issue fixed if you want your 5 stars. Very unsettling for my two year old boy.,
"Love it my great grand children have used it.!! All my great grands have used this app from age 2, 3,5. My 7 yr old will still play it with the youngest one to teach her. Now we have another baby 6 mo. So I will be using this game for him not to far off. Recommend it highly.",
My three year old Loves this app. I love the vocabulary that's introduced. I would like to have an option to use lowercase letters as well as uppercase.,
I have to keep editing this bc this game is so glitchy. Now the animations after the child finishes the word doesn't work. For 9$ this is ridiculous. If you're not going to fix the game then don't comment only about the price 🤷🏽‍♀️,
I love this game and so do my children! Very educational and entertaining. Fantastic for kids learning letter and letter sounds!,
great app unfortunately yet another game have to purchase to unlock other levels so most likely will have to delete the app because my daughter is getting bored these apps are very costly will add up after a while it would be nice if companies can throw parents a bone provide free apps,
"Guys, I paid for the full content, but it didn't unlock. Now when I try to tap the unlock item it says it's already purchased and nothing happens. Please fix or refund.",
"My grandson really likes it. I just wish it was a little more sensitive To putting the letter in when he has it in place, but needs to lift his finger. Hope that makes sense!",
"We love this app, I first got it over 6 years ago for my first child, all of my kids have loved it. I'd give it 5 stars, but it's not activated for the family library, and it's too much money to pay for it on more than one device.",
"Please Help/Fix. It was working perfectly find until last week. On the second part of the word where they define the word and show an example, nothing show up.... so my daughter and I are sitting there confused and she's just sitting there like momma fix, please. We come out the app, shut down her tablet and nothing. Paid for the full app. My daughter really loves this app and it would be ashame for me to have to delete and request my money back.",
"Fantastic app, our non verbal is hooked on this app. They can spell words on magnetic letters and understand what the words mean. It is well worth the money.",
The whole originator are very and the monsters are very funny especially the itchy animation yeah that can be good one con is that they mismatch the letter combination phonics but it is okay it is mainly for spelling,
love this app for my little one when he was a year & trying to teach him letters & sounds. He loved it! Recommend this app 3 or 4 times over to friends & family.,
They should have made a version where you can purchase the whole app up front. You can't share this app with kid devices that are part of Family Link and I'm not going to purchase twice in-app when 1 doesn't even work.,
"Love this app, as do my children. Helps with phonemic awareness and provides spelling, vocabulary practice with funny clips.",
Issue with in-app purchase content not download resolved itself. Updating my score to reflect the full-feature app. Good stuff.,
This app is great. Too bad it isn't offered in other languages. Would absolutely love to use it with my french speaking kindergarteners.,
"nice app! the games are very attention grabing 😍 we love how playful, colorful, and fun the games are. the price is a bit expensive for us, but there's a lot of free game namn",
This is a great app. You do have to pay to open more words. I am always okay paying for educational apps. My 4 year old daughter loves this app.,
I have been with the app since the begining. My daughter taught herself her ABC with this app. I.recommend the app to any one looking for a way to help their little ones.,
My child is expanding her vocabulary and learning not just letters but sounds that letters make as well. The creatures are fun and charming.,
I had this app downloaded for my son and paid for the extra content. We switched devices and now it won't work. It's like the extra was never paid for,
"One of the best ways to introduce kids to letters and words. I tell everyone I know who has kids or works with little kids, this app and it's sibling apps are worth their weight in gold!",
"It's a bit expensice but very fun and edeucational, but it won't download the new words after I switched phones.",
Love the numerous word options and the nice descriptions given. Cute program that exceeds the usual expectations Id have for a 3yr old vocab. Worth the money to have the extra words.,
"Brilliant, engaging and a great tool to teach words to a 2 year old. Thanks to this app she now understands the sounds the letters make.",
"Great fun app - my 2 year old saw the video first, and now enjoys the app. App is relatively expensive compared to the other spelling apps available, but the content is brilliant!",
"Oh my goodness! This is the kiddiest game ever! Actually, it isn't that babyish, you just know what the words mean, but I'm not interested, also in the logo, the font looks like a baby font, and I don't like the kiddiest games!",
"My 3 years old loves this app. Every word has to be put together, every letter is sounded and spelled and the word is described so kids can understand. Best app!",
great app for kids! very educational with superb graphics and animation. hope to see more apps like this from the creators soon...keep up the good work,
Loved this game! It was perfect for both of our children. They both are so bright and have expansive vocabularies. I am certain this game played a role!,
"My son is autistic and loves this so I decided to pay for the full app but all the letters from B-Z say ""waiting for complete download"" and at the bottom it says ""oops something went wrong"". I have checked for updates, my wifi connection and still nothing? I emailed support and still waiting for response? Please help my son gets fustrated easily and really wants to enjoy the full app.",
Words are too difficult. There needs to be an easy mode with 3 and 4 letter words for 2 year Olds.,
Wow they really need to fix their glitches I'm not the only one that's having problem with this I already paid my kid was playing for about 3 days and now she can't even pay it's like I didn't even pay for it such a rip off once the issue is fixed I will take my review off until then I'm leaving my review as one star this really pisses me off because my kid is asking to play the game and its educational and if it worked a right and allowed my kids to pay it because we did pay,
"My 18 month old is identifying letters. He can use this app seamlessly! It's amazing, just costly for full access 9 dollars is a bit much.",
"my kids love it, but now the animations dont work. I bought the full version of this game and now there are no animations.",
Great app. Not available for family share so unfortunately I bought it for my account but my daughter can't use the full version on her tablet.,
I have been finding the perfect learning app for my toddler and this is it. All the other apps out there aren't free and as good as this.,
"Highly bebeficial for slow talking toddler to form rudimentary sounds (ahh, kkkk, chchch, rrrr etc.) If your child needs more help learning to talk definitely get this! Totally worth $9!",
My son loves it and is very educational however for some reason the animations after the words have disappeared which is very disappointing especially for my son who loved them,
"Would be a 5 star review if a bug could be fixed. We have the parent and child profiles set up on our child's tablet, but all the words we paid to unlock only work on the parent profile on the tablet. They are all still locked in the child profile.",
"The ""U"" floors me every time. My daughter and I laugh a lot. The humorous way they sound out the letters is great.",
"great game, other than after you purchase it for $9, you only get to play it for 3 days and the game disappears? total rip off I would like a refund !!!",
I bought this but there is a problem...it says waiting to complete download....and then it doesn't work ....I payed almost 10 dollars for something that doesn't work,
The developer needs to allow family library sharing. We shouldn't have to repurchase the same app in order for our child to use it. Defeats the purpose of family sharing.,
Very useful app for my daughter. She loves it. My only suggestion would be to introduce small letters as well as capital letters.,
I am not using this app with my third child the first two I hadn't be unlocked with everything on Apple but my now one year old still loves it regardless of the amount of words,
"What a great app. Well worth paying for the full version. My son loves this game, and the vocabulary is very extensive. A plus!",
I have paid for all the letters but they are not downloading. Keep getting an error msg.,
Good game its great for learning mostly for maybe 3 to 5 im 8 and i rememberd this game and downloaded it its free but you have to pay to complete the game thank you for me mom for actually pay it anyway im 8 and i lerned a word i dont know this game deserves 4 and a half star but just for my mom its a five,
Must go for purchase. My little princess is learning recognise Letters really fast with this game. Also tried Endless Spanish... That's also Super..,
"Targets kids for purchasing. Other kid apps have an adult section, this on you just click through into a purchase. Update: if there is a grownups section, why is the purchasing not in there.",
"Used with my oldest son, he absolutely LOVED this app. Now using on my 4 year old who seems to love it also! Such a fun learning app!!",
"Because of family share i have been double charged for this. I need a refund for one, i will fix my review when i get a 8.99 refund. Thank you.",
Love the involvement this brings. And the he loves type clips that show what the word means. I wish they'd add more words to it.,
Great. My sons speech is terrible and behind. But this app has helped a lot. I love and appreciate this app.,
My speech delayed son showed much more interest in letters and their sounds after playing this game. I am more optimistic about his learning to speak after watching this change and that fills me with joy.,
Paid twice and now I don't have access to the words again. My children love this game but I can't keep purchasing it over and over.,
my son is now 7 but I got this for him when he was 18 months and he started reading at age 3. I credit this app with his phonetic understanding of letters and sounds,
"I've been trying to find a way to help my preschooler with their alphabet and sounds, and this game has caught their attention in the best way!",
"I like this a lot, but the word Melt does not have a story after you do it. We did it many times and it is missing.",
Great app with great animation my children love it. Would be nice if you could switch accents from US to UK english,
used to love this app. payed to unlock full app for kids. now it does not work on their tablets. very disappointed and unhappy. i wasted my money.,
This is good but why does most of the game cost money? I'm going to use this for my baby sister which means I have to use my own pocket money and It is annoying since I was going to use the money for me because I only get pocket money once a month,
Pure nostalgia fuel. I used to use this all the time when I was 6 or 7. I would like to see a multilingual version though.,
My little girl loves this app and I was trying to purchase the full version but I can't find where to do so. Please advise. Thank you.,
Some words like rescue dont show the animation after completing the letter match portion.,
"These are great apps however as a single mom of three if a tablet get stolen its asking me to pay again how do i redownload so it shows prior payment i really want my son to hzve back access but its useless if we cant load them, i literally paid for all the bundles through family link but y sons account isntshowing them as paid",
All my kids like these games. My 2 year old really has blossomed with remembering And identifying her letters and sounds.,
"My kids have all enjoyed this app and the other ""endless"" apps too. Of the apps they have on the tablet, they gravitate toward these ones.",
My son lovessss this. If your kiddos like endless numbers and endless alphabet they'll love the rest of these apps. They don't empty your wallet and are educational!,
"Brilliant app. My boy loves it, very educational and worth the money! Thanks",
"I FEEL like this would be a good app, but 90% of it is behind a pay wall 😢 Edit thx for replying but just make the base game 8 99",
"One of the Best Educational Apps I have used, bought the full package and all my grandkids have learnt from it and love using it.",
Like this but some of the illustrations for the words aren't pulling up. Needs to be fixed,
My 6 year old and 4 year old are excellent readers for their age and in large part I credit this app and the other apps made by this company.,
"I buy all the words, they refund my purchase. I rebuy again, they refund again. I repurchase game, they refund again, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.",
Crashes on Samsung s9.. uninstalled then reinstalled and works fine now. Thank you so much.,
words will not download after paying for the app. even after I deleted and re-installed it still wont work.,
"Such as, but limited to words. Payment has declined. If you need help, Please contact app developer.",
This looks like alphabet lore but 2 year old version with lazy animations when dragging. The looks are ugly and change the looks to mike salcedo alphabet lore!,
"Hi. Please help me. I already bough all the letters last week, but why its still downloading the words? It almost a week.",
I love this game but the thing is you have to buy the rest of the game you only get AB and C'S and I think that's really unfair for the kids so if you change it I will give you 5 stars.,
I let my kid use this app to spell and learn the alphabet and I couldn't believe when he came over to show me gargantuan and when he tried to press on something to spell it was trying to make me buy all the other letters and I just can't believe on how it's endless alphabet when you cut the letters off I hope you rethink on how you made this learning game 😡 and you should let people have a choice if there a teacher or not so then the people who aren't teachers don't have to pay for letters 💰,
My daughter wants to give this 10 stars. Cute letters and great learning vocabulary spelling and reading.,
"Amazing -- since my kid turned 3, this app (and all the rest) have been so helpful! Great tool!",
"Bruh, they look like backrooms entities, for a reveiw for my Youtube channel, the letters are annoying and too simple to Spell a word make it harder",
My 4 year old playing on a Raspberry Pi running Android full screen size and mouse. Really good.,
My son loves this app I decided to purchase the full version however it has been a week and the new words have yet to be downloaded I am extremely disappointed,
"I purchased it,and it's been whole day that it's still downloading.emailing the originator but no contact.very poor response service and app services.",
I don`t understand why these are so expensive. Why offer a free app with only 3 letters of the alphabet and then get a child hooked and charge so much for the rest? This causes complete meltdowns with special needs kids because we cant afford your high prices and have to tell them no. This is a rip off.,
It Is So Awsome And Funny My Child Is Learning The Alphabet Easily Now. They Are Having A Great Time.,
Love this! I purchased the full version. Any way I can get it on multiple devices?,
my kids love this app. I bought it when my son was little he used it and now his two younger siblings use it. I tell everyone about it for their kids.,
That game has a problem the word kind is has stuck my phone it's said pls delete the app and install when I install the app when I open no more the words they gone it's purchased alone IAM not happy wasted my money for nothing😭😭😭😭😭,
"This only let you have 7 levels for free, and then you have to pay $8.99 to open the rest.",
My 2 yr old is learning his ABC so quickly!,
"My 5 year old grandson loves this app. It's funny, creative and educational. Very clever!",
Amazing!!! One of the top children apps out here! Everything I've been looking for in a kids app.,
NOT FREE! Reponse to comment: And they delete your review? My review was commented but when I went back in it was gone and not editable? In the Apple store they show that it's $8.99. I'm sure they are taking advantage of a rule in Google Play Store to be able to say it's free. So don't lie when you say it's not your intention to mislead. Obviously you are when you should put it as a Paid app. If you want users to test it first why is the Apple store version a paid app?,
Great app. Would be 5 except can't Family Share the app. Seems silly not to allow for Family Share on a children's app.,
All 3 of my grandkids loved this game. Helps with hand and eye coordination and to recognize letters.,
My daughters love this app! It really helps them identify letters and they love reading!,
"My kids adore this series! It has helped them read, recognize letters, and even de wlop speech.",
"Great game for kids, ad free, and not too expensive for full version.",
"nice app but words are limited, better if you have more simple words and lower case letters.",
Super fun and educational! My kids are learning phonics and how to read!🥰,
This is so bad bc there are less words are in there please make free words so we can use to play,
"I think the app was the best Learning app I got. I downloaded the APK Version of it, maybe I hacked it",
I've used this for years with my kids and they love learning their letters and sounds with it!,
Love this app it really got my toddlers attention & he started learning the sounds & letter names so quickly.,
"I like only 1 star because other words are locked and only ALARM, ARTISTIC, BELLOW, CELEBRATE, CONTRAPTION and COURAGE are unlocked.",
The full version of Endless Alphabet letters is not compatible with your device because I have it anyways so for you i love the apps educational,
It's really good for kids but they play it all night long I guess I give it 5 stras but if it doesn't work out put your child on falmy likepiz 😊,
"This is one of my daughter's favorite apps, and when she found the vidoes on YouTube. I knew I had to buy it. We've been using the free portions for years. I Just wish I knew if they all came in one app, do they?",
Originally I rated the app a 5 because it's awesome. However I paid 9 bucks and now it says downloading new words since I purchased it Saturday night. It is now Tuesday afternoon. How do I get a refund?,
Great app. I wish the ability of family share was available. I mean I paid for it... Why can't we use on all devices?,
My 3.5y old liked this so much she purchased the full version after 20mins of trying it . Kids are getting too smart these days.,
"My 2yr old grandson loves this game. I enjoy watching him play and says letters, there sounds and the words",
A good app but it's been around for awhile and a limited supply of words.,
Love this app and how it teaches letter sounds and letter recognition! Great app!,
My 3 year old loves it and was recognizing letters and sounds after only 1 week!,
Endless ABC is a English game but you have to arrange all the letters on the word but you also need all the words.,
OMG!! I boycotted the Endless games after I realized they did NOT cross over into Family Share Library. I repurchased numbers and words for my then preschool child... But turnover in elctronic platforms and repurchasing is rude and greedy! Will my in app purchase expansions need repurchasing? I hope you guys fixed it to be more customer loyalty friendly. Will modify after downloading if i see your still monopolizing by parents not REALIZING single platform purchase price ad nauseum...,
"This entire experiance was a religious awakening. I have never felt so amazed and curious. This game made me quit being an emo, a furry, a munch, and it got rid of my autism.",
I love this app and we paid to unlock all words but a couple days after paying its locked again I tried emailing need thia fixed please,
My 2 year old loves it and is getting great at recognizing the letters and sounds,
"My daughter loves this app, simple but colorful and fun!",
I dont like the part where u spend 8 dollars and 99 cents too expensive plz change the price to free everything unlocked plzzzzzz,
"I live this, all my kids love this even my 18 month old is quickly learning letters!!",
I love that this game is for learning because I'm a big fan of learning please do more endless like an endless ABC Hebrew edition,
"love the app, but frustrated it is not compatible with my galaxy tab 3.",
It's good up until they lock everything back up and you have to pay for it over and over again...,
What a cute & fun app for preschoolers! My daughter giggles watching the cute videos.,
"Hi, afree purchase the app, why the other phone with the same app installed still locking?how to unlock the app in that phone?thank you",
This app is helping my child learn to read and write while having fun.,

"We have to buy for other letters!!! It's so disappointing, please don't install this! It's a SCAM!",
I don't like the way that to get all words I need to buy it for 7 pounds but what I do like is that it has words. What else that I don't like is that I have access to only a few words!,
My 2yo learned all his letters and the sound they make with this app that he BEGS to play.,
Helped my kids learn to read at an early age. Wonderful app!,
Amazing app for little ones getting into words and letters.,
My kids love it and at the same time are expanding their vocabulary.,

Can't purchase the full version. Tried so many times.,
"We love this app, only problem is that if you buy it on your iphone you have to buy it again for Android. They should just have a master account you buy",
My boys learned to read sight words before at a very early age because of this game.,
The few words per letter get old pretty quickly.,
It's excellent game for kids to start learn alphabet.,
Ertz was not the first team in the league but was a freshman in the NFL in a bit as he did with the first round pick and a third ×÷4#4÷=,
My son has since outgrown it but we LOVED this app when he was learning letters.,
Why is this app include 7 words? I can help me get the full version of this game if my parents buy it for me plus i love it!,

Easier words for younger kids learning ABCs would be great,
Great fun engagement and teaching app for kids!!,

"Great app, my daughter and her friends all love it!",
Excellent app for kids and my kid says it is super nice and he likes it,
Very nice allows kids to engage with fun very creative I'm impressed,
Omg I can't believe I found this game again! I remember always playing this app with my sister in 2013-2015 Really great app💕💕,
looks like false wait for download but just a really old tablet take long time to load,
"Good, but is there a reason why every app has in-app purchases? If so, please tell me. Why should someone pay 9 bucks for everything?",
Great learning tool. My 4 year old loves it!,
"Only 5-6 words in trial and 50MB download, 600₹ for another 20-30 words",

"Just for knowledge to other parents, this app is a great for youngsters to learn the sounds of the alphabet as well as for special needs children. My Son has been playing on this app since I found it seven years ago. It taught him his alphabet and keeps him coming back to practice. The little cartoons that explain the words are very well done and makes my son laugh. Once again. Thanks for the game!!",

"Only not 5 stars because doesn't allow family sharing, what, both parents have to pay for it? otherwise great app, fun and funny and I think kids learn both identification of letters, their sounds, and their contribution to the words. Plus some fun long words for the kids to use randomly. In app purchase needed to get all the words. Really sucks that family share doesn't apply to that. I have a separate account on my tablet I let kids play with and can't share the entire app.",
"We used to LOVE this game but it hasn't been showing any animations after 
the word has been put together. It's very disappointing since we paid for 
the full app. It'd be great if this was fixed! Edit to add, we have 
restarted the device as well as uninstalling and trying to reinstall. This 
has not fixed our issues.",
"Love this app. I do which more educational games like this would be free. 
Nothing is better than watching my kiddo learn.",
"My two year old loves this app. Been using it for 2 weeks and he started 
pointing out letters in the book I was reading him tonight. Sounded out 11 
letters from ""Room on the Broom""! Amazing. Absolutely worth the money. 
Thank you devs.",
"I'm hoping it will help my 2 year old to talk. Its the only app where he 
actually pays attention and is interested in what he is learning. Its 
adorable, cute and I couldn't be happier with this app!",
"I used Endless Alphabet with children receiving speech therapy services. It 
is very motivating, reinforces sound production, and increases language 
development.",
"This app no longer works even after Uninstalling and reinstalling. I 
purchased all the words only to have his app crash and my 2 year old loose 
her mind when I crashes.",
"My 3 kids all enjoy this app. They like the funny characters and I enjoy 
that it says the letter sound and name, as well as teaching them to match.",
"Okay. After my original review, I read and found someone with my same issue 
of no animations. A reboot fixed the issue, and it also did for me. She's 
about to be very happy. Sorry that I didn't read all the reviews first.",
"I was going to delete as not many free options but ads aren't too bad and 
my 2yo gets lots of fun out of the free version",
"If you are going to let them play with your phone, you can't go wrong with this. It's fantastic.",
We love this app! Simple puzzle solving combined with letter recognition and phonics. The short animation of each word is funny and my daughter will watch over and over. The words they choose are thoughtful and it is so cute to see your kid try to use them everyday.,
"Love the concept but it shuts down all the time! I regret paying for it. I 
have reported the errors every time",
"My 2 year old daughter loves this game & asks to play all the time. I would 
probably buy it if it also had lowercase letters & I wish it spoke a little 
more slowly.",
"These apps should be Family Shared. I don't want to pay twice for two 
devices and two accounts. Please consider.",
"This has been a great sound tool for our kids, it still comes to mind 
sometimes, listening to it. Very worth buying. Their numbers one is great 
too!!",
"My two year old LOVES this game. In just a few weeks time, he is now able 
to easily recognize and name nearly all letters, and his enunciation has 
improved. Great game, so worth the cost!!!",
I cod only go up to level 3!!,
I like it even better than reader rabbit. Entertainment for 5years of kids.,
"My toddlers love playing this app and have learned quite a lot of their 
letters from it!",
HELLO MY 3 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS APP AND HAS MANAGED TO SPELL EVERY WORD BY MEMORY!! ITS AMAZING!! EVERYONE ASK HOW HE DOES IT!! I BEEN RECOMMENDING THIS APP TO EVERYONE!! I WOULD LOVE TO UPLOAD VIDEO OF HIM IN ACTION!! THANX ENDLESS ABC!!!!!,
I use new phone and install this.. but it said i need to pay again... using same account,
Great app for children learning to read and write,
"If I like the game, I can play Endless Alphabet all day long.",
Fascinates my four year old in the best way!,
Wish I'd was full app,
My 4 year old loves it,
Best app for learning letters and sounds,
Excellent for 4 years old and up,
No lower case by the look of it. Why would I want my child to learn to read in all capitals?,
Our toddlers loved this app.,
"Doesn't play the animations after you complete a word on Samsung Chromebook 
Plus.",

"It's incredibly frustrating that I have bought all the letters to this app 
3 separate times in my family library. If I'm managing a Family Link 
account, there should be some sort of offer to accommodate.",
"My 14 mth old is mildly interested because of the sounds. I'm sure later on 
he'll really get into it.",
"I got it for my 2 year old cousin, it has helped him learn the alphabet and 
the sounds of letters! He is even trying to use the words it teaches him!",
My 3 year old loves this game! It's so engaging,
This is an amazing app can the creators please make an endless colors app,
"Like the way it teaches letters, sounds, and vocabulary.",
I BROGHT ALL THE WORDS!!!,
Endless Spanish Alphabet,
"My kids liked it so I bought all the words. I did it with my account so I can install it on both kids' tablets. It turns out my account has to be the only one on the device for it to work. Now when one of them wants to play it, I have to remove their account and log into mine. 5 minutes later they want to watch YouTube, so I have to log myself out and log them in. Terribly annoying.",
"I dont know if I had a glitch or if the app was free for a long time, but I went from having a full alphabet of words to only 2 words in the letter A. I like the concept of this app with the pheonetics, but I think that the letter sounds are too quick in regard to language and reading developement, especially for kids with auditory isues. I give this app a 3 for being ok, I wouldn't purchase the full version  though as we have purchased more then enough apps.",
"This app is great and my 2yo is learning a great amount from it. We bought the add-on pack, but this would be even better if it was eligible for family sharing. Is this something that the developers will be doing later, because we want to purchase packs for the other apps, but I'm apprehensive if I spend extra money and can't share it.",
"My 3 y/o loves this, especially the animations. You don't get that many words for what you pay so more words would be great. The word odour (English) is spelt odor (American) so should be an option for uk/us words (especially if more words like colour/color are added). Would like it if when you unlock it the words stayed grayed out until you have played them, that way your little ones would know which ones they haven't done yet.",
"Not much variety in the free version (only letters a-c), but my almost 3 year old and I are very impressed.  The silly way the letter sounds are repeated until the letter is put back in its place, keeps her interested while teaching her what sound each letter makes. Very creative mixture of puzzles/problem solving and letter recognition. $8.99 is a little steep for a child's app, but we'll consider it if the free version keeps her engaged.",
"Good way to teach words, but could use a little more in the features to teach letter order.  Such as a slight glow around the letter needed next (both the letter and the letter slot).  I've had plenty of students whom I teach literacy too (child and adult) who do not understand that and put the letters down in a random order.  The program is less helpful to them, and it is the current struggle with teaching them.",
Wonderful learning aid wrapped in a fun game with adorable monsters. Excellent word choices to expand their vocabulary. Very entertaining videos to further explain and show usage of the word. Hands down the best app I've ever gotten for my daughter. All the Endless apps are a amazing and have enjoyed them all.,
"Apps are great, however I wish that the in-app purchases could be moved to the SD card. My children have different developmental needs and therefore I have two profiles set up on their shared tablet. Originator Inc. games are by far the biggest and most expensive apps on there and I can't fully download the games without, as they suggested, deleting other apps (that can't come off) or buying a new tablet. I'm a little disappointed. I was actually looking forward to purchasing more packages.",
Great app for learning the letters. The words might be a bit difficult for younger children but at least they have many letters. My only gripe is that the Endless apps do not have any more interactivity beyond dragging and dropping letters. It would be more interesting if children could interact in some way with the objects during the videos.,
"We had the free version which included animations to define each word. When we bought the 12 dollar (steep price) app there were NO animations. Extremely misleading. DO NOT PURCHASE if you expect to get the animations, it ends up just being the letter puzzles and than a small button in the corner explains the definition but no visuals for the kids to understand. Brutal!",
"Amazing game, helps to reinforce the phonics learning we are doing at home already. There's lots of apps that teach ABCs, but very few with a focus on letter sounds! I never pay for apps, but this was well worth the $9 to unlock all the puzzles. Planning on purchasing the Endless Numbers and Endless Spanish as well!",
"My son did love it since I got it for him over a yr ago, but none of the animations work after you spell the word and he's sad about that.... bring the animations back or fix the issue and I will give 5 stars.",
This is one of the coolest educational apps you could ever dream of. My toddler has a speech delay and this app has helped my toddler tremendously. He knows so many words and their meanings now. I'm so excited with the process and progress. This app helped my child break out of their shell. I'm so proud of how well my toddler speaks now.,
The app itself is ok.  I bought the words pack (now $9) and when I put it on my daughters tablet she cannot access the words.  I have to remover her account from the tablet before it will work.  And I already tried the google family thing can't add this game to it.,
Great game for a toddler just learning their phonics and word sounds. My granddaughter loves it and asks to play it everyday. She never tires of it and doesn't even mind repeating words we already played. She has her favorite words based on the cute and funny graphics. The cartoons are cute and the letter sounds really funny.,
Bought all the words and now none of the animations are working after completing the words. Not impressed because my 4 yr old loves this game.,
"I was skeptical with the price at first, but my daughter loves monsters so i figured i would let her play the free version until she got bored with it. She played the same free words over and over and didn't get bored with it. When she started copying the sounds the letters made as she was dragging them, I reconsidered the price. Flash cards and a couple of alphabet books would be more money than this app, and there is no guarantee I could keep her engaged enough to learn as this game does. So I bought it for her... A good purchase in my opinion if it helps her learn her letters!",
"My 7 yr old girl who has a delayed language disorder has found all of these Endless reader apps incredibly helpful....she is engaged and the way the words, letters, and sounds are broken down to hear and the words are made into monster shapes makes learning so much more fun and helps her better retain the images of letters in her mind",
"My 4 year old speaks incredibly well, and I highly believe it's because of 
her utilizing this app as one of her speech tools",
"What a terrific game! My son enjoyed playing it so much that we went ahead and paid 9 bucks for the full version. Given what you get is 54 mini-games of top-notch quality, 9 measly bucks is an absolute steal of a deal.",
"Educational and fun, there is a glitch though the animation seems to be missing after letters completed to form words. Please check and get back. Thank you. Update: i purchased the full app and still no improvement. No animation was playing. And no one got back to rectify the issue.",
"Got the free version first, then bought the $9 paid version. Now the game crashes every time I try opening the app. CUSTOMER SERVICE PLEASE FIX THIS",
"Bought the full version, but none of the animation works, not even a single one, just go blank after all the letters are out together. Please fix this.",
"Played a word, bought the in app purchase, tried to open it on a ZTE Blade 
and it crashed after the title screen. Switched off the phone, tried it 
again and same thing.",
My 2 year old loves this app and has started identifying letters in books and cards. Love this app. Worth the cost to unlock all the words!,
"My almost-2-year-old son loves this app and it is teaching him the sounds of the letters, all of which he already recognizes, without him even knowing it! He thinks the sounds are entertaining and he is probably also learning big words that he will use in the near future. My only issues with the game are: 1) The Home button is in an easily accessible spot in the upper-right corner of the screen that he keeps accidentally tapping, which is very frustrating for both of us when he returns to the home screen to pick another word; I hope they can change the button to be double-tapped, like in Fisher Price Puppy. 2) The crossbar on the T is too similar to those in the I, so my son easily gets them confused, which again causes frustration when he can't match the letters. Even though the colours of the letters are different, the bars are too similar in length to be differentiated by toddlers learning to identify text. Other than those issues, we both approve of the game and think the cost is totally worth it. I hope they are continuing to add animations to the words that are missing them and that they will add more words to spell in future updates.",
The game video has more than the game. If you are going to lock almost all the words as in game purchases.. just make it a paid game. Waste of time,
"My wife downloaded this app for our 3-year old to try and within seconds she had purchased the full version because THERE IS NO GATING QUESTION PREVENTING PURCHASE (selecting any of the locked 93 words takes you directly to the Buy screen).  But never fear, it's unlikely that your little one will be able to look at the social media accounts, as those are protected by a skill-testing question.  Complete scam that all but assures you'll pay $12 for a bunch of word puzzles because of this UX decision. Asked for a refund and was told ""tough"". Super disappointed and will not be recommending these thieves' products to anyone.",
"Great game and my kid has definitely learned his alphabet with it. However, at some point the little animations at the end of each word stopped appearing. The app is updated so i don't know what happened.",
$11.99 for the full version. Free version lets you spell 2 words. So glad I tried it before giving it to my kids. Too pricey. Uninstalling.,
My 4 yr old loves this game but it stopped working. I uninstalled the app and downloaded it again only to have it still stop.,
My daughter and I love this app. The animations at the end were not working for a while but the support person was very helpful and prompt in replying and a simple reboot of the app resolved the issue. Many thanks to the app team for such a brilliant app.,
"This is a great app for kids learning how to spell and read, however when there is a word with a long vowel and short vowel of the same letter it doesn't matter what order they go in when putting them into the word. For example ""cooperate"" each ""o"" is a different vowel sound but you can put them into the word in whatever order you like.",
I can't believe how much money  they wanted for a little ap. No thank you.,
I purchased the full version for my son's Nabi tablet and it's no longer compatible with his tablet. I just bought my younger son one and wouldn't of I had known that a bunch of apps were about to update and no longer work for them.,
"I despise apps that are called 'free' but offer so little free content and throw all purchases into your child's face hoping they bug you to buy it.  How about a lite free version with all unlocked words, and if parents want full, they will buy and unlock.  Don't tease pre-schoolers with all the locked content.  That's just low.",
It crashes EVERY SINGLE time my I open it. EVERY TIME!  AND Google play doesn't offer refunds for games that DON'T work!  So try at your own risk.  Feel comfortable throwing $9 out the window.,
Its a great app for kids.. But only 5-6 words r available in free version. Please make more words available.. At least a word for every letter. My 2 yr son is so curious to play all the words. BT when only few words that he cn play he cries,
"Only lets you access 2 letters of alphabet for free, then you have to pay. Disappointing.",
"I cannot reinstall the app on my wecond phone. I paid for the additional 
content but cannot seem to recover it anymore. Such a waste of money.",
I bought the full version and now that its updated my purchase is gone and my daughter can no longer access the letters she loved the play. Extremely disappointed and will not buy again if that's what it takes to restore the letters,
I have told everyone I know about all the endless apps. And I'm involved with a group that helps new mothers and these apps are the first thing I will be talking about,
My son has loved this app since 18 months and my daughter (4) is finally interested in letters bc of it,
"This app is beautiful, funny and truly educational. My 2 year old knows all her letters and the sounds they make because of this app. It's unbelievable. I love every app by this developer.",
There are no beginner words that lead up to more difficult words. This appears to be an app for more skilled readers so I cannot use right now. Had I known I would have purchased the numbers package instead. In a few years I may be able to go back to this app but it is useless right now.,
I already purchased that game but I cant download all the words ! it took me a lot of time to download it and the result..  7 words only . please help me.. my son really loves it,
"Not free ,DONT LABEL FREE IF IT IS IN FACT NOT FREE. THANKS FOR THROWING MY KID INTO A TANTRUM",
Our 3 year old loves this app. She has learned about half her letters in a week.,
"My 2 and 4 year old both love this game. Not many words unless you pay a little extra, which is what I did. Love how useful this learning game is.",
"Very engaging and educational.  Clean, crisp graphics and smooth animations with great voice acting.  I have seen my son's motor skills and knowledge of letters improve in just 2 days.",
"My granddaughter has had many hours of fun since first playing Endless ABC. At three and a half, it is incredible to hear her using the words appropriately when she talks. She has been using this for about a year and has asked for more words. Any updates or version 2?",
Bought words. Total rip off. Just keeps failing.  Warning this is not very likely to be a mistake. Do not buy anything from these thiefs.,
The Endless apps are the best educational apps out there! They have ingeniously combined entertainment and education that kids will play for a long time without getting bored. Love them!,
This app is great! Our 14 month old loves this app. It would be great if we could add our child name to the alphabet,
My daughter loves it but some of the animations for the words do not show up or play.... which is a little disappointing.,
The animation after spelling the word does not play after the screen times out. You have to restart the device to fix it. Please fix this.,
11/26/17 It's crashing constantly on my Samsung phone every time I try to open it.,
I love this app but it isn't shareable to the family account. It is an expensive and high quality app but it isn't reasonable to have us buy it for every device our family owns. Our son loves playing it and it is just really inconvenient to only have access on the one phone.,
I never spend money on apps... except for this one. We bought all the endless apps. They are so great for learning and the kids love to play them more than any other games.,
"I think this app is great, however, I fond some of yhe words to big for my litle gus to pronounce but also yo understand, even though there is a demonstration/ explanation  at the end.  Good app though and fun.",
"I bought the full version thinking it was eligible for the Google play family library, it's been a while since purchase and still nothing. If there is a way and anyone can point me in the right direction on how to add it it to a family library I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks.",
"Amazing! 2 year old toddler loves it, and his recognition improved noticeably in a matter of minutes. Really good app, it covers a multitude of fields, from letter recognition, enunciatio, vocabulary expansion, and creative application. It is all around amazing!",
A fabulous app. Not only works on phonics and alphabet but enriches vocabulary and makes it ALL fun. Great job.,
"Used used to love it,  but now as soon as my daughter finishes a word it kicks her out. Sooo she doesn't even get to watch the videos, which was her favorite part.",
"I love this app, my 2 yr old is learning quickly! However, after the lesson 
there is usually a short video that plays involving the word that they 
learned. And it hasn't been doing that. Can you help?",
Helping my granddaughter make the proper sounds as she fits the puzzle pieces back into the word. Lots of fun to watch her learning so easily.,
"I love the concept, but I paid for the full app expecting the videos at the end of every word illustrating the meaning of the word and the only words with the videos are the word you get with the free trial. If every word had the illustration at the end, it would easily get five stars from me.",
Purchased it for $9 and all it does now is crash. What a waste. Hoping it could still be fixed.,
Bought the full version bc my daughter loved it so much.  Now only a few animations at the end work...which was her favorite part! Any help on how to fix this issue?? This would be worth the price if it actually fully worked...very disappointing,
"My newly 2 year old learned all the letters in 2 weeks of doing this.  Now when she is playing I call the letter I want her to pick to make sure she knows it.  It has been a blessing.  I wonder if you have one for numbers, shapes,  and colors.  That'd be awesome!",
"My daughter loves this app. However, she is frustrated that not all of the words have animated definitions therefore declaring it broken. It's a great app, but our version has a lot of bugs.",
My daughter LOVES this game! Only downside is we have it on one device and I'm hesitant to pay a second time. It's definitely worth it though.,
"I wish creat app for Arabic Lagrange please also lot people speak and reade Arabic🤑 more that there is alot people learn Arabic trust me ,,😉",
"Very nicely done! Does a great job helping toddlers learn letters/sounds /words one of the best toddler apps I've seen, you don't need to feel so guilty for screen time with this one!",
"MY children, ages 3 and 5, love this app and ask to play it all the time! Its helped with letter identification and spelling.",
"This app is amazing! The creators should think about selling this with the 
other apps affiliated with this on a device for parents who want their kids 
to have a kid friendly tablet with no internet.",
"Fun app to introduce letters not just in alphabetical order but also in context (in words) using letter sounds and names, word definitions and cute monster animations.",
Would be five stars but it's not shareable across the family account.  If you do purchase make sure it's on the account your child will use all the time.,
"Great app! Pricey, but definitely worth it! My daughter has learned her ABC's through this app and has helped her learn new words. Would recommend this app to parents who want to help their child(ren) learn their letters.",
"We love the app, downloaded after many rave reviews from other preschool moms... I paid for the full version this AM and now it just crashes everytime I open it.",
Beautifully done app. Me and 2 year old love it. Easiestly the highest quality toddler app I've seen.,
"I cannot say enough about this app. I questioned the price... But in just three days my son, who is delayed, can identify the letters on the fridge and make the sounds they make. I'm amazed!",
"The free version worked, but then I paid for it, and now it crashes upon opening! Completely useless now and a waste of money :-(",
"Awesome game! My almost 3 year old is enchanted.  Note: Amazon Kids Kindle edition errors a lot, so I purchased this for my Android phone instead.",
"Amazing app, paid for the extra words, but for some reason the animation isn't working anymore. The video after the word. Please help me resolve this",
"This developer sets the bar for quality educational, valuable interactive content for children. The price may seem steep for a mobile app but it's actually cheap when you see how packed it is with lovely professionally animated content.",
It's a great app just hate having to pay so much to unlock everything b,
2 free words then you have to pay €10 to unlock everything else. Please don't market this as free.,
"My two year old granddaughter uses this app; doesn't quit comprehend fully, but fully impressed with her matching, repeating the words skills learned! #itsastart",
My daughter had loved this game since she was fifteen months old. She's four now! Fun and educational.,
Already purchased this before.  It won't let me redeem it to be used on my new device.  It was not a cheap app and I am very upset that it doesn't have that option.  😠,
"This would be a fine app, if they weren't demanding $8.99 PER DEVICE! You 
have to pay that amount on each device you install it on. I want a refund.",
Rediculous get 2 words thenhave to pay 9$ for everything else,
"It really helps to expand my 4 year old niece's vocabulary.  The demonstration videos really bring the definitions home. Such a well done app.  Quality audio files, pleasing animations.  I feel good about her using this app.",
"The only problem is that the animations for the definitions don't work on some words, specifically on Kazoo,",
Abit pricey but kids love this. It's incredibly well done,
"I really like that it shows the letter,  makes the sound,  and says the name all together (but not at the same time). The engaging graphics hold my child's interest as he goes through each word.",
"Our 3 year old loves the playfulness of this game . Had this a few days and  and she's already learned how to put letters in order when spelling. Voices are hilarious, definitions con ise and memorable, music is excellent.",
Best game for ages 2-8. My daughter learnt so many words with this game easy to use. Funny characters. No ads,
My son is autistic and he has learned so much from all the endless apps,
Very very disappointing! Only had two words she could do and the rest costed money.,
Paid 9 dollars and can't put it in my family library for my daughter to use.,
My 2yr old twin boys teacher recommended it! My boys can't get enough of both games. I'd downloaded it on all my electronic devices.,
Would be five if I wasn't just reviewing to get the pop up to stop.,
My 2.5yr old loves this app. She repeats the letters and makes the sounds. Great for introducing the alphabet and for letter recognition.,
I love this. It's so cute. But how do you unlock the other omes my sister wants to know! Great work!,
My son loves this game but after I bought it the words will not download. I've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it.,
My son loves this app an it helps him make an found out words an letter sounds,
My children never want to stop playing on this app! We absolutely love it. Great for vocabulary expansion and they get a visual for the meaning of each word. Excellent app!,
Amazing app for teaching young kids letters and vocabulary. My one criticism is the 8 dollar price tag to unlock all the words. This seems on the expensive side for an app.,
This app have been a great help for my 2 year old daugther.. Thank you,
"The paid version is completely worth it. My nearly 4 year old son loves this game. He knew most of the alphabet before starting this game several weeks ago, but now he can identify every letter of the alphabet. When we are out in public, he can identify a letter in a sign or written somewhere and usually tell me the sound it makes. The definitions are able to be understood by him and he uses many of these words in his daily vocabulary now. I would definitely recommend this app.",
"Endless Alphabet- haha it only lets you do ABC before charging $8.99, but my kid loves it and it is worh every cent!",
Great game. Shame the sound constantly stops working.,
"With The full version you temove the animation once the word is spelt, free version is better, i want a refund",
Amazing graphics and a seemingly 'endless' amount of words. Not one of those annoying apps for toddlers and kids!,
Good stuff.  I love the creatures.  My toddler learns letters and likes seeing the animation.,
It has too many things you need to buy,
"Bugs were fixed and now it works amazing! My 2 year old loves this app. It 
makes learning fun!",
"Expensive- NINE DOLLARS? No. Also, crashes constantly on a brand new Samsung tablet. Made my son frustrated with the crashing and extremely limited free play.",
I have not purchased as it is expensive for an app and I can not add to family group. I'm not going to pay for it twice at this price,
Is great for learning letters and spelling my 2 year old looks like a genius to our friends. But when it glitches or freezes  he looks like a mad 2 year old,
"Pricey for an app, in my opinion.  Son loves it tho!",
how can i move the apps to my daughter tablet pc? i do installed it on my phone and purchase to unlock the levels. but i wanna move it to other deveice because its so unconvenience to lend it always to my daughter i need to used my phone everytime for some reason. thank you,
It's a nice app but it is not free. That's misleading,
My grandson had a large stroke at birth and he has learned all his letters from this app!!! And he makes all the motions and sounds of the animals!!!,
Hello I need help.. my daughter loves this app so we downloaded the full app on her android tablet but we need to return the tablet because there is a problem. I've downloaded it to my old phone galaxy s6 but it doesn't show the complete letters and seems like I would have to purchase it again? I used the same play store log ins for when I bought it,
The free version has 2 words to get any more it's $8.99.,
So entertaining!! 5yr old loves this app laughes during the who learning experience!,
Educational and fun for my 4 year old! Cute graphics. Bought the full game.,
"Amazing! My daughter is almost 2, and she can do this all on her own now after us playing it together for just a short while. It's such a great way for her to learn new, interesting words while practicing her alphabet. I love that when you're holding the letter, it gives the phonetic sound and when you place it in the correct spot in the word, it says the letter. And, most important, my daughter loves it, she asks to play it all the time and has so much fun. Bonus, it's teaching her tenacity and patience because she doesn't always get it right every time but has quickly learned if she keeps trying, she'll get there, which also takes patience. Thank you so much for this amazing app!!",
My niece + nephew love this game! Please add more words in your next game update!,
I like you Even though the zombie song,
My daughter LOVES this app.  It's really helped her with letter recognition and sounds.,

First time I paid for full version.I had to.My 4 yo son loves it,
"There's no way to exit the app if your home screen button is broken.  And it costs $9 to get past letter ""c"".  Why not just charge the price in the app store??",
All my kids love it. Great words to build your children's vocabulary,
I think that this is really good at helping kids to learn what it means and being able to spell it.,
"My almost 2yo loves this game, and it looks and sounds like real quality",
Love it and it worked fine for me thank you for making this game even though it is a baby game,
My kid loves this game and has helped him learn his letters.,

This a great tool for young kids to happily learn words and there alphabets,
"Great app, but can't add to family library after purchasing.",
"Great fun, lovely animations, son is already learning words and letters",
"Great for toddlers and preschoolers for identifying letters and the sounds they make, as well as vocabulary words.Awesome",
I am needing to know is it a one (1) time charge of the $9 or is it $9 per month?  Please let me know thank you!,
My 3 year old daughter really love it. So much fun,
This App Is Fun I Can Type words,

My 18month old and 4yr old both able to use this and interested in the music and animations with phonics too for less than 3 quid you cant say fairer really :) Why do i have to pay separately for each device????,
"For the letter ""A"" only two words are available, after that it wants you to unlock extra words for the rip-off price of £7.49!!! Save your money.",
My daughter is 4 and absolutely loves this game!,
Worth every penny. Incredible work.,
Great to learn sounds of letters before kindergarten!,
My 3 yo is in love with this. Just buy it,
Suddenly unable to access after a month of paying? Is this some kind of scam? I dont recommended buying this application!,

I pitched the full version last year but now when I installed onto my phone it is asking to pay again. How do I restore my purchase??? Also happening with Endless numbers app,
Some of the videos dont play,
Game wants your money,
How long does it take to download all the words? I just purchased to unlock all words but it's been 3 hours and not even one word is downloaded. Please help me. Thanks!,
Unlock New words,
Ashton Carlisle,
برنامج رائع,
OK,
I tend to download games with my account for my kids and I test them out on my phone before putting them on their devices. I purchased the full version of this for my 3 year old but it looks like I have to purchase the full version on both my phone and her tablet instead of just doing it once. Really disappointing. :(,
"My son is diagnosed with autism and this game literally tought him what sounds letters make snd how to talk... hes been in speech therapy since he was 18 months old . . . This game has helped more than the therapy.  Knowing then what i know now, i would have paid a hundred dollars for this game.",
"Don't let the 'free' fool you. To unlock  the full game it is very pricey for a phone app. That said, this is the best young child's app I have ever dl'ed and well worth the price tag for me. I have also purchased almost all the other apps (except the Spanish one.)",
"My only complaint is I wish there was a way to just sign in and pay for all of the endless games all at once, and have it available on both my phone and my touch screen computer. I don't want to have to pay for the same thing for two different devices and it would be nice for my 2 year old not to have to switch through apps if she wants to do a different one. Them all in one place would be nice.",
"We love this app! My son, who is 3 now, started playing at 2. His favourite part was the video at the end. I love that new words have been added but since then, the videos don't play after the words completed. If you could please fix that then this game would be near perfect! The only other issue is the words are American. Not oriented to the country. *issue was fixed thank you",
"Of the countless free and paid apps, the ""endless"" series has been the absolute best. My Daughter (now 2, been using for ~4 months) engages so well with the application, loves the noises, animations and LEARNS! It's pretty phenomenal how positive her experience has been with both this Alphabet and the Numbers apps. The developers have done a fantastic job, and although it may seem steep at first, the quality and results speak for themselves.",
"Fun way for kids to learn letters,sounds,and words. After I seen how much my two year old enjoyed this and mimicked the sounds of the letters I purchased full version. Great job with the app! One small issue. If you hit the recent app button that opens all your recent tabs then re-enter endless alphabet it takes you back to the home screen of the app Instead  of where you left off in the game...that can be annoying",
My little ones loves this game. It's fun and easy for my 2 year old to play and even my older ones love learning new words through this app. If your kids like the free download then it's defiantly worth the investment to pay for the rest!,
I just bought the full version and now I can't see the definition clips ...I lobe this app but now I'm mad,
Excellent but a bit too pricy for a phone app and it can't be shared to the children's account. It is also not too smooth on a low memory phone/tab.,
"In app purchases took affect 10 minutes later, great App.  Original Review:  Purchased full game, doesnt download just says ""you already purchased this"" and all words stay locked. Have one very dissappointed child.",
"4 and 1 year old girls, absolutely loved this one. So worth the money for all words. The app is easy to navigate and looks gorgeous.",
"My son loves the game. I originally bought it on my phone, but I've bought my son a tablet and I can't transfer it to it. I'm not happy about it at all.",
My two year old loves this app and is learning his letters very well from it.  Worth the $8.99 price tag.,
We loved this app but the animation quit working. We paid for the full version so I am pretty upset,
This is a very fun way to learn phonics and new words. My children enjoy it and ask to play it often. I gave it four stars because you cannot add new words.  I don't think they have added new words in the two years that we have had this app.,
"Great for kids, my son can now identify the name of a letter just by hearing the sound without seeing the letter. He is three",
"This app is awesome, it's also expensive, for the price it should be a family shared app. My kids love it! And it would be nice to not have to buy it 2 or 3 times.",
It's a scam. you pay 30 dollars to get the games that you already payed for them they want you to go to there website so they can charge you even more money for the games that you already bought that's how you get the other portion of games too work,
I tried this out and loved it so much I bought it.  My 3 year old started imitating the sounds in this game as he begins reading 3 letter words.,
"Makes learning an endless fun.  I never thought I'd say this about an educational app, but the Endless series is a work of art.   I love it... I mean my 4 year old daughter loves it :)",
Hilarious way to learn letter sounds and extra bonus is forming great vocabulary words which are defined and acted out. Big problem- only has capital letter forms.,
My 17 month old son knows how to use this. It helps him a lot to familiarize with the alphabet. 😊 Just having a hard time in purchasing the whole package.,
Very dissapointed.   I have purchased the full version and will NOT work on my kid's restricted account.  Please fix this!,
My 3 year old loves this game! I was about to purchase it for my phone however thankful for previous reviews as I will NOT purchase it for $8.99 with no enabled device Sharing. It's almost expected for it to support multiple devices for the price. Other then that great app!,
Bought this app for 8.99. It will not open. Not worth it,
We love this app. I wish it were available for family sharing; I feel like it should be for 8.99.,
"If you say it's free, make it free. 7 words is all that are free, then it is $9. Even those 7 free words were hard to find. It looked like 2 until I went digging. You should state that it is VERY limited unless you pay. Terrible!",
"The end animations are fun but I baulked at the high price... $12! Considering letters exhibit the same behaviour in each word, I'm not sure the value is really there. Also wanted to check whether it's 'zed' or 'zee' but that's locked too.",
You get two words! Two! $8.99 for the rest of the game to unlock. Game had serious potential. Deleting the other apps by same company before I bother teasing kids.,
Great app.  My 3 and 5 year old love it!,
Loved the ease of use and wonderful sounds. Very kid friendly!,
"My child loves this app, the explanations of the words are very engaging.",
It's a good app but was deceived.,
Keeps crashing my 4 year old daughter’s brand new tablet...From the few seconds she played it she loved it.,
Love this app! It's easy and fun for the kids :D,
This was working great until I paid for it and now it is not working properly on my phone won't even load up fix or refund please will give 5 stars if it starts working,
Purchased the game on my account. New words won't load on my kid's restricted account.,
"My daughter learned words with meaning and how to sound letters, it a great app",
Add the words labyrinth and fantastic  P.S I am in love with Yoshi and Amy,
My 2 year old has surpassed  my 4 year old in letter recognition,
Awesome! My 2yr old loves it and she learns phonics and letter identification,
Beautifully crafted app that my daughter loves.,
Perfect for my 3 year old to learn the sound and shape of letters in an entertaining way!,
No way to exit this app.,
Brillaint!! Helping my boy spell words at 5!! Thank you fab app,
"Totally cute! Teaches letter sounds, not just names.",
Great except for the price. Wish there was a combo pack.,
Needs more free words... my 2 yr old loves this game...Sorry Some parents can't afford to pay for more words..,
My son likes very much,
So grateful for this app!!! Is the only one we use.,
"You get two words for free then need to pay $8.99.  Sorry, but no.",
Love it...just needs additional words or a circulation of them.,
It's an ad for paid app,
"Excellent for  letter recognition, phonics, and vocabulary.",
Our 2 year old loves this app!,
Отличное приложение! Great application!,
My two year old absolutely loves this app! Amazing!!,
The short clips at the end of each word stopped working even when i was connected to great wifi they werent working my kid kept telling me to fix it,
You only get  A to play and then you need to buy  the rest!  Uninstalled,
My baby brother love's this game and he's only 24 months old,
I love it!! Very educational.,
My toddler loves this!,
Too expensive... Sigh,
It's fun and my 2 year old loves it!!! Almost as much as I do!!!!,
Perfect  game  for  kids  😀😄,
My toddler Loves this app!,
Absolutely worth every penny!!,
my 2y/o son loves this app.. :),
Very good!,
Great learning app!,
It's perfect.,
It was so fun,
Good learning tool for kids,
Well worth the money,
I need all off it  :-(,
My son loves it,
Fun and informative,
Not bad,
Great app,
good for kids,
Where is the exit button??,
Great app,
Cool,
Awesome,
Love it,
Superhelpfull!,
Maybe!,
"Great game, beautiful art and sound, very educational. It should have a free version and a pay version that you can share with Google Play Family sharing though. As it is you can't share the paid app and need to purchase most of the letters on every device separately, which is really expensive.",
"I think this app is really cute, however, on Apple if you tap on the screen with the Animation is playing, there's these colorful letters that appear. Like, say your child just completed the word Belch and now the Animation is playing, on Apple if the kid taps on the screen colorful letters appear, there will be a B, then E, the L and so on. Please ass this to Android devices. That part also helps kids spell while the Animation is playing",
"Purchased In-app purchase but it only works on 1 user account even if trying to use on the same device. I want a refund didn't even bother using expansion, because we can`t use on child`s account. For this price it should be part of family account and available on multiple devices as well.",
"My three year old is fascinated with this game. She loves matching the letters and repeating the sounds each letter names. Definitely worth the money to buy the complete game, and for me that's saying something, as I rarely buy games or let her play with my phone.",
"We downloaded this wonderful game on our family tablet but when the tablet died, we tried to reinstall the full version in our new tablet. The support team told us we had repurchase the game again. How disappointing that our original purchase  was not honoured.  Also it didn't allow us to install the game into our various family devices. Installation into our family's shared devices should be allowed as it is being used as a family.",
"The free version gives you almost nothing and the paid version is FAR TOO expensive for me or even my school to consider buying (I'm a kindergarten teacher). I can also get a very similar app, with similar design, for FREE and many other full version learning apps for free or a lot cheaper (10-20% of your price). Which means you are especially pricing yourselves out of market. On actual content, I like the style and animations but there is no spelling challenge as it doesn't matter what order letters are dragged to the word. Also no lower case?",
"I love the content of this app. It keeps my 3 year old entertained and she's learning the whole time. However, I originally downloaded this app to my phone and then downloaded it to our tablet so that I wasn't losing access to my phone. The app wants me to purchase full access again which is ridiculous. If the cost were only $2-3 I would be more than happy to pay again but I refuse to pay an additional $8.99.",
"I have no problem paying for a quality app for my child. My problem here is that I downloaded what was advertised as a free app only to find that after two words me three year old would be frustrated because EVERYTHING ELSE WAS LOCKED. Two words is not a free app, it's a tease. I will not be paying for the full version. I'll be uninstalling  immediately.",
"My 2 year old loves this! He thinks the animation is hilarious and just hearing his non-stop laughter makes this app totally  worthwhile. And obviously it's educational. Not only does it teach letters and spelling, but also the meaning of words with silly, fun animations.",
"We've added the endless alphabet app to our favorites list. Our little one loves it so much and it is worth the cost of just buying it up front. Not just another silly game but educational and fun. There's plenty of content to keep them from getting bored after only a few minutes.  Very well done app - Toddler intuitive.  No distracting ads or constantly asking for more purchases on the free version either, just less content on the free version. We love these!",
"My son bought this app on his tablet and was not able to use it on another tablet.  My son bought this app signed in as himself (there is only one Google Account on his tablet).  For my son to purchase apps (he is only 5) I have it setup to use the family purchase method after he brings me the tablet and I enter my password to approve the purchase.  The receipt I got from Google Pay also clearly shows that the purchase was made by my son, from his account, with my permission.  However, the developer has the app linked to my personal account and so he cannot use the app on his other tablet.  The developer was not helpful in resolving this instead suggesting that I just add my (personal, adult) account to my son's devices.  So this may or may not be a decent app, but its now usable apparently for children inside of a family setup, which is certainly where they should be.  Very disappointing as my kids wanted pretty much ALL of the apps this developer made, but now I cannot buy any more of them.... :(",
"This is one of 3 of the Endless apps that I purchased for my son who is on the Autism Spectrum.  They significantly helped to build his vocabulary when he was struggling with a speech delay. When he was given a iPad for therapy purposes, I spoke to the developers and they arranged to have the purchases refunded on our android device so that we could purchase them on the iPad without having to pay a second time.  I couldn't be more happy with both the apps and the customer service from Originator.  They clearly are committed to education and not just making money.",
"My almost 3 year old has been playing this game (along with Endless reader & the number one) for a little less than a year now. He's obsessed and knows all his letters and numbers. I love how it teaches the phonetic sound for all of the letters because that is really the most important base for reading. You can get any kid to memorize their ABC's but that won't help when they try to sound out words. Thank you so much for this very creative, silly and playful app that really can help teach children to read.",
If you pay for content in the app it will not share with another device. Total ripoff. The free version just ticks my kid off. I asked the email for customer response on how to share with another device and they responded with iphone instructions. I asked again about Android through google play and have not heard back in a week. Android users do not exist for these people at all.,
"Don't get me wrong, this is a good app. My daughter loves it but, lately there has been some issues. The last letters don't play a little show, like usual to explain the definition. Also, there has been odd blackouts and freezes. If it weren't these happenings I would've rated it 5 stars.",
"My kids love this game; it is engaging and the interface is simple and easy for them to use. The design really does a good job of associating the letter sounds with their shapes. I appreciate the vocabulary of less common words and the simple, yet accurate way that even complex or ambiguous meanings are explained. I also like the colorful cast of characters (and so do my kids).  I bought the full (paid) version and considered it an excellent value. And since then, an update has added lots of new words!",
"I accidentally came across this app when I was looking for some learning apps on google play. You may have to pay for these, but I find them worth EVERY penny! I really hope they add even more words in the future, but this game has taught my 3 yr old daughter more words/letters and numbers than flash cards and boring kids shows taught her in a year! She loves the way the letters make monster sounds and the beautiful animations. Her favorite word so far is ""Contagious"" she giggles and says ""Ah Choo!"" Lol!",
"My 2 year old loves this game! I feel good letting her play it bc I know that she is learning letters, sounds and how to spell. She has learned great hand eye coordination as well.",
I usually don't pay for games but after hearing his giggles from these cute little monster letters I had too! (It had us parents giggling too) He loves it and I really think it will help him with letter recognition!,
"I adore this app. I do think it would be wise to have the words spelled in order. Maybe have a page where the kids put the whole alphabet in order. Introduce sounds in addition to letters,  like ""ch"" etc. A little more focus on phonetics. But excellent job!",
...but you are pricing yourselves out of the market at 7.49.  2 or 3 pounds and I would buy.,
"My daughter loves the silly sounds. There's a bunch of words so she doesn't get bored and she gets to work on her letters, phonics,and vocab.",
My son is 2 years old and we have tried sppech therapy and this app has really gotten through to him.,
I gave it 3 stars because it freezes if tapped at the opening video and often doesn't display the word action after the word is completed.,
This app helped my little one keep his   spark for learning and now he can read at a 2nd grade level! Having trouble getting it to work on my Galaxy Grand Prime though...,
"It's fun and easy for him to navigate, so he plays it all the time. He is constantly using words from the app, and he does so in the appropriate context. At 2 years old! This app is amazing, and so is Endless Numbers. The Originator team is brilliant! Thanks for such awesome, fun, educational apps!",
"You free app is a great tease....Endless Alphabet is anything but endless.  My grandson went  through all the words in one evening.  The letter A only had 2  words, really?  For the cost there  should more words or different  levels. Great animation, but GREATLY disappointed!",
The sound isnt working on the letters when trying to match them. Support hasn't been able to fix the issue. After paying what I did for this I'm disappointed,
"My kids like the app, but it crashes frequently on different devices, and recently downloaded over 120mb via cellular data on my smartphone without prompting.",
Daughter has always been good with recognizing words and sounds but I love how it's broadening her vocabulary.,
"My kids love this game, however, it will not allow me to purchase the full package, so they get bored with it very quickly.",
"My son loves this series of games. I recommend them, despite the kinks. Tech support is responsive.",
But very few words in free version and full version is not reasonable price.,
"There are only two words in the free version. Unlocking additional words costs almost ten dollars. No thanks! The two words it has are fun to put together, but then I have to deal with a grumpy kid who can't move on in the game. Not fun.",
For some reason this and the numbers app freeze within 30 seconds of playing it. Pixel C.,
He puts the words together and when it goes to the next screen it doesn't play the video.,
"Thank you for your timely response , problem fixed. An excellent app!!",
After purchasing this game it won't download the new stuff sent a email hoping to get my money back. If it had worked I think my daughter would of loved it!,
We realized how excellent this app was when our 2.5 yr old son started using the big words from it correctly. It's well thought out and the animations are priceless! Thank you for a job well done!,
"I installed it for my daughter and she really enjoys the words, sounds, animations and explanations!",
This game helped my son learn his alphabet well before he turned two. I bought the extra words with zero hesitation.,
My son likes play this game. Very well made and adorable art. He is really learning letter sounds. I would give this five stars in a heartbeat if all of the words weren't written in all caps.,
Try them! You'll want them all for your kids.,
I don't like those games where you have to make an in app purchase why not just charge 8.99 for the whole app . but it is interesting enough to get my 3 year old boys attention,
"Purchased the full app for my son.. Bought him a new tablet and tried to download full app and I have to pay again!! Seems like other people have had the same problem. Other than that, it's a great app.",
The Fantastical but what it doesn't tell you when you install it and hand it to your child is that they will be done with the free portion in a few minutes and then you have to pay almost $10 to unlock the rest of the game by that point your child is hooked and you're going to have to spend the money,
My son absolutely loves this! He's learned so much in such a short amount of time. Would highly recommend it!,
"As an early childhood educator I absolutely love this app! It's well designed and clearly has education in mind as it teaches letter recognition, letter sounds, spelling and definition by description and visual! Plus who doesn't love fun monsters?! Highly recommended!",
Locks up after every definition is read aloud every time. Paid good money for nothing. Pixel C android n stable. month later still no update. Worthless developer with no support,
So upset. Updated and now its not compatible. Child is so disappointed,
My 3-year-old loves this game!  What a great way to learn letters!  Docked it  star because the animations don't always play.  No error message :-(,
My 20 month old loves mimicing the sounds in this. It has really helped his vocabulary.,
"I purchased the entire alphabet for my son only to have the app refuse to launch and crash his device multiple times. It's like they wait for you to pay and then render the app useless. Same with endless 123s. I received a refund, but this is either malware or a straight scam that relies on inattentive parents to fail to notice. My opinion? SCAM.",
"My toddler absolutely loves this app but for some reason, it shuts down whenever I try to buy the full version.",
"Most recent update freezes after animation/definition, needs a fix, please!",
"My daughter loves this. It would be great if there were different levels, but it's still great!",
"I love this app for my 2yr old. I am really disappointed, however, that I paid $9 for an app that I can add to my husband's phone/family account. Can this be addressed to make it more family friendly??",
"My 14 month old loves this app, so did both of my boys when they were younger.",
"My 2 year old has enjoyed this so much I wish the videos would come up like they did in the beginning, none the less is still a great tool",
I have used this with several children and they loved learning from the fun sounds.,
Kids live in France and are bilingual. This game reinforces their English skills.,
Its not free. Its advertised as free. I can live with that. But the free is so minimalistic - it has only 2-3 words.,
My one year old learned all of his letters using this app!,
"My 3 yo looooooooves this app. She repeats the sounds of the letters, the letters, and the words as she's playing. Her vocabulary has increased exponentially since starting this app. $9 may seem like a lot at first but it's completely worth it. Seriously, I have NEVER pain that much for an app for even myself but this is completely worth it. She's going to go into preschool with a vocabulary better than most of my 3rd graders. Once she has gotten everything she can from this one we will DEFINITELY be getting the reader app to continue her education.",
Love this app!!,
My 3 year old loves this game. Very fun and educating!,
"Description says there are no limits which is not true, only a few of the words are available, and it's expensive to unlock the others I would call that a limit?",
Paid to unlock all words and my kids love it and it works great. I recommend it.,
My 5 year old and I love everything about this game!,
It's fun but I wish  the wish  the words were all on locked,
My 2 year old loves this game and all the other endless games.,
Daughter loves this app.  The lettets make cute funny sounds.,
"It's sooooo cute, but helps my daughter learn too.",
"Great application, but the full version is pretty expensive.",
"My child loves this but on,you Alarm and artistic are a viable to me",
Fantastic app. Great learning tool. I'm telling all of my fellow parents.,
My son is so entertained by this and he's learning!,
Its gives you every little before it ask for money,
Thank you for making my 3 year olds FAVORITE app,
"My kids play this often. As for me, I love the creative genius of it, too! Enjoy!",
Like how it interacts with you and and all of the fun stuff to do,
"My kids love it, and so do I.",
My 3yo loves it.,
Endless ABC is great education for my kids.🤓,
Just know all levels aren't unlocked from the  start.,
My 4 year old son loves it .,
My 2 year old is doing so well with it!,
"Love this app, my kids learned letters really quickly",
My granddaughter is 2 1/2 and still loves to play...,
Could do with being a bit cheaper,
She loves it and she's learning,
My 2.5 y/o loves this app... Educational and fun!,
Absolutely intellectual for little ones!,
If my child could play 2 minutes with out adds.... Really,
Keeps two busy boys entertained,
All you do is drag the letters in to predetermined places. There's no spelling challenge at all. And it's £7.50!,
My daughter loves it and I do too!!! She is learning so fast! :),
Installed and paid for the app .. changed phone a few times and I have repurchase  the app?,
Best for toddlers!! We love it!,
Why are the words all in uppercase? This is not how the words would be presented in books - nor how they should be written.,
My son loves this game,
"Purchased full app, but there are no animations after the word have been completed",
$8.99 for all the words? Are you serious? No thanks.,
When my daughter want to play can't turn on it....,
It's awesome,
shut up,
Great for the little ones!,
Great fun and learning.,
Amazing app!,
Hours of fun with learning thrown in,
I like it,
After i updated the app. The new words still dhows as downloading. I even tried with wifi but not downloading. Please check this,
I LOVE THIS GAME,
I love it,
Great job,
Great for kids,
Kids love it,
Perfect.,
I bought the app on my android phone. Is there a way to transfer my purchase to my ipad/icloud?,
Spelling game,
Niceeee ******,
"I'd like a full refund please ,I've triedcrestarting and even reinstalled the app. I want my money back",
Kids love it,
Excellent,
Great,
Great,
"I bought the full app and it's been ""downloading the other words"" for like 20 min. I've emailed the address...hope it can be fixed or refunded",
"Please allow my wife to get full version through my purchase so our girls can play on her phone.     Only 20 words for $15???? Please add more words - more children words like ball, water, fruit, etc....",
Thanks,
Goor,
Super,
Xoxox,
Yeah,
Tylan,
"Like others I think that when the program works it is very appealing to children.  However the program is deceiving in the sense that most of the letters are blocked unless you pay $9.   Upon payment, more letters are supposed to download, but the program keeps stalling and showing error messages.  As several others mention the same problem it seems this company is shameless to continue charging money for a seriously flawed product.",
I've played with this game for 20 min and just laughed. My 2 yr old loves it! What a fun way to learn the alphabet and improve vocabulary. The on con is I think the navigation buttons should have more color or an easier way for little ones to use them.,
"I love the program.  It's designed wonderfully and the phonics games are ones that the kids will actually play.  Unfortunately, anytime the app updates it requires you to ""Download Additional Words""  This has led to several issues:  1)If you have apps set to auto-update you can find yourself out with the kids but no words are available to actually play. 2)The app does NOT check for WiFi Status BEFORE downloading extra words so it will make quick work of your data plan if you don't realize that it had updated and needs to re-download ALL THE FREAK'N WORDS.  (On a 4gig plan it burned through 1.9gb in 1 hour.)  Developers need to work out a balance on these issues. Until then I'm going to turn off updates for this app.",
"As a teacher and a mom,  I love this app and my toddler does too. It's very well designed. The graphics, video clips, and interactive elements are academically sound (supporting emergent learning with best practices) and fun. Its worth paying for a high-quality learning app with no ads to distract or confuse the learner. Now, I'd rather they say ""zee"" than ""zed"" and pronounce the letter sounds a little more clearly. But for letter naming, phonics, and vocabulary practice that's so enjoyable and easily accessable - it's worth the trade. Well done!",
"After my daughter finish a word, it goes black and you hear the sounds. Also stays black afterwards, access any words, and it takes a minute or two to get to the home screen. Please fix this problem.",
My kids  love this game and it is adorable. It strikes a great balance between entertaining the kids and not being annoying to the adults in earshot (usually me).,
My 3 year old loves this app. She laughs at the monsters and is learning so quickly from it. Was definitely worth the price. Will be buying other apps by this developer.,
Update removed 90% of free words (DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU BUY FULL VERSION). Update also killed word animations when a word is completed.,
Game was fine but free version is so limited  that dont bother unless you are willing to pay $12 (!) to download  the free version.,
This app is beautifully done. My son with Apraxia will immitated the sounds and letters they make. Definitely worth purchases all the words. Customer service is great to work with and assisted us with getting the app to work on a restricted profile.,
"Would be a 4 or 5 star because we love it, except that it will not download the new words, just keeps saying error. Restart the app. Have tried it on several different devices, same thing.",
This app is fantastic for a child starting to learn the alphabet. It is by far my 18 month old sons favorite game. The controls are easy for him to use and keeps him entertained while teaching him his ABCs. Well worth the money.,
My 2 yo boy loves this. Got it for my 5yo girl who didn't really show interest. But my boy plays it endlessly. Thanks for always updating vocabulary. Great game,
I can't buy the full version. It sends an error message every time I try,
The perfect app for a word hungry toddler. The accompanying animations are wonderful. Just one little irritation is the American spelling for 'odour' - odor - I'm sure these things can be tweaked according to the country the app is being used in?,
My son loves this game. Makes him laugh while learning,
New update doesn't play the cute videos after spelling wors...,
"No thanks, great game for kids if you want to spend the money.",
It has been fun watching my son advance with this app from learning just how to move a letter at 18 months to sounding out the letters by 2 yrs.  Now he points out letters on signs and sounds them out.,
"my daughter used to use this a lot, we paid to unlock some features, today when my daughter tried to log in everything is reset and there are only 2 words available. No support chat, no support email that I can find.  Will change if fixed.",
My daughter absolutely loves this game and all of the Endless games. They're so educational and perfect. Bought the full versions of every one of them. X,
My 18 month baby girl luv this game so much... will cry if we didnt plsy play it...,
"Seriously £7 to unlock b-z you should be ashamed, there's far better free apps out there for kids to use, utter rubbish",
My two year old loves it and has already started identifying letters after only two weeks.,
"I was having a little trouble getting my daughter to focus on the letters and phonics, but this app really helped! Even my 11 month old likes it!",
I have 2 phones. Works well on my sony xperia but can't for Lenovo. Can please fix.,
"I downloaded this app a year ago and now when my daughter tries to use it, it only has some words she can play and the rest says waiting it is waiting to download and some are new words. What does that mean? I try to see if i can repurchase the words but it won't let me cause i already did, any help?",
My son has used these series for almost 2 years and they have him reading at 3! Grows with your kid and keeps them interested in learning!,
My 3-year old loves to play it and he's learning the alphabet much faster since he's been playing it.,
I purchased. This app now it doesn't work,
My 3 year old loves it and I can tell he's quickly learning.,
My daughter love this app so much. She is using this everyday. Thank you keep it up. God bless.,
"I love the word 'construction', and I like the movies after each word. And I love how I play the game. -my daughter",
My 3 year old started playing this app a few months ago and in no time was recognizing letters and sounding em out. I am so proud! Great app!,
"This is a beautiful app and would appeal to a wide range of ages. My just two year old loves it and keeps asking to play it, after a few days he is already sounding out the phonics of most of the letters and is quickly learning the names of them too. I have twin nephews who are six who would also benefit from this app. It is well worth the price for the quality you get. My only request is that a future update enables the letters to be in lower case as only capital letters are currently available. Don't hesitate to download!",
I love the wide range of words that you get with this app.,
My grandson loves letters and this is a great pastime.,
My kids love this and I love that they are learning letters and new words!,
My two year old knows letters and their sounds.,
My 2 year old learned the entire alphabet playing this game.,
My 3 year old loves this game she is learning letter reconzion and sounds,
My 2 year old loves this app!,
"It crashes a lot, taking the fun out of learning",
My two year old has been playing with the free version and loves it,
My 3 year old loves it!,
Both my students and my kuds at home love this app!,
"Got this for my grandson, he loves it",
Try it out!,
I will be in the past two weeks,
Funny and informative.,
Loved it just from tiny free part,
I looooove love it.,
My app is endlessly stuck on 'downloading new words. ..' for two weeks now!  What do I do?,
"My son loves it, but it's definitely NOT ""free""",
My grandchild is in love with this game...,
NOT FREE!,
Love this app!!!!,
Amazing,
But i have to pay 8.99 just to get out of letter a,
Cool Kids,
$12 for the full version? Don't you think it is too expensive?,
But you get three letters and not even all of the words in those three letters. You have to buy the rest.,
Very fun,
Fun and educational,
Kids love it,
because i love it,
I love it,
💞 it!,
"Besides the fact that it will crash when it comes out from the background apps, there is one thing keeping me from giving this five stars. If you spell out the word once the letters are assembled and before the word is said, like you count out the numbers in endless reader, I would think this app is perfect. But it sticks out a bit that it's not here because I think it would go a long way towards helping children learn to spell.",
"My 3-year-old daughter has been learning so fast and easily with this wonderfully done app. No regrets purchasing. Education is worth every penny!!! This app helps children learn in many different ways. It is visual, interactive, and tells you if you don't get it right and reinforces correct answers. My favorite feature is how the letters are like little creatures and they make noises of how their letter is pronounced in the word it is in!!! Brilliant! It is also so cute! I enjoy playing this with her! 😄🌈📚📄💜",
"This app is great, it's entertaining and my daughter loves it the only problem is that it keeps crashing after only a few minutes of playing it.",
Every since I bought all the words the app no longer works! 😠 wasted my money,
My 2.5 year old loves it. Now 3 and can recognize all letters by sound.,
It's a great app for the kids. But it's not free. What is free are two words. Then you pay £7.49 for the remainder of the words. Surely either charge for the whole app or provide at least 10 words!!!!,
"My grandchildren absolutely LOVE this app, they play with it for hours... All of them fight to get to play next... It's truly incredible!! I wish for more of these learning games for children... Thank You!!!",
"the application stops on works after C and not worth the purchase, any suggestions?",
...for my son,
"I like the application,my toddler really loved it but after I purchased the whole game it started to act up. The application close by itself, the letters froze and can't  move it and my child starting to get frustrated. And sometimes after you finish the word you can't even see the video. I need to restart my phone over and over again.I like this application I want to give 5 but because of this I just gave 3. I hope you fix it.",
"My daughter really loves this app, unfortunately after we paid the $5.99 and downloaded the rest of the words it starts to act up. The letters get ""stuck"" on the screen. The video doesn't play when you finish a word. Also it's hard to get our of the app. Although the intention is awesome, I wouldn't recommend this app until they fix the issues.",
"After all these people payed the expensive price of $6.00 for your app for their child,it doesn't work after you take their money. One would think if your app was for a kindergarten or younger audience,that you might refund some of these parents money, fix it, or at least respond.An APOLOGY would be the Least you could do. Refund of the app price is the right thing to do.",
"My little one loves the animations and I find that her letter recognition is improving the more she plays it.  It would be great if there were even more words, but I gave it 4 stars because it sometimes freezes.  I have the full app on my tablet. Wish it had a nighttime view.  My tablet never seems dark enough.",
4 yr old son loves the animations after the puzzles.  Downloading word pack was easy and faster than expected. But animations wouldn't load after the download. I emailed support and they responded next day. Just rebooted the phone and works perfect now. Thanks for beautiful affordable app,
"The best learning apps! Unfortunately we cannot afford preschool. Your apps have made learning possible and fun for my child who is now 4 years old. She looks at  letters everywhere and she can tell me what letter it is and the sound of the lettr. Being proud of her is not hard, but her being proud of herself is amazing and beautiful. Thank you.",
"App crashes constantly, and now we lost all the in app purchases we paid for. My kids love the other ones, but they need to work the bugs out of this one before I can give it a good rating. :(",
"Upgraded my phone, redownloaded this app but can't get it or the Endless Numbers to play for more than five minutes without crashing. Such a great app, otherwise. Not sure what the problem is but we can't play them at all anymore because the constant freezing/crashing drives my preschooler batty.",
My daughter loves the games. So I paid the $6 for the full version. Downloaded it on my daughter's tablet under my Google play account and lost the full game. I refuse to re buy the game. I would have totally b left 5 starts if it wasn't for that.,
"I only rated this game 5 stars so this could be seen...I downloaded this game for my 4 year old daughter as well as the rest of the ""Endless"" games and purchased the rest of the words for 5.99$ and it says that the words are still downloading. Also when she starts at the letter A once she puts all the letters in the correct spot and it starts the animation for that word, the screen turns black and we can't see anything but we can hear it. Then I have to hard reset her tablet to get it off the screen because it pretty much freezes the whole tablet. I'd appreciate my money back or this issue to be fixed so she can play this game. I planned on buying the extras for all the ""Endless"" apps but as far as it goes now, I won't be purchasing anything from these developers until this issue is addressed.",
"For those having a problem with all the words endlessly saying they are downloading... Force stop the app, then restart it.  As soon as it came back up, all the words were available.  My son is absolutely in love with this app.  All the sounds that come with each letter leaves him non-stop giggling.",
"I have mixed feeling about this app. As of now I only have the free ""LITE"" version which is only letters AB &C then you must pay to unlock the others. I have no issue with that as I was planning on purchasing the full version. My issue is even on the lite version when my child completes a word there is supposed to be an animation with the monster demonstrating the word. Instead we get a blank screen an only hear the audio.  My child quickly fell in love with this app because of the silly animations of the letters and monsters but, if we are unable to watch them then it is completely pointless. I will not purchase until this issue is fixed. Also I am reading similar issues from other users. I m not sure if it is device specific or Android version specific but, the developer should take these complaints seriously and work on them. I have not seen any replies from the developers on comments which is worry some. Makes me believe the app is no longer supported. Very unfortunate.  If this is fixed I will definitely buy it   Samsung Galaxy Tab 3  Android 4.4",
"My daughter loves this game as much as I do. Early literacy games have been a big hit for us. Since playing this game, my almost two year old has started to read sight words. I can't fully credit this game, since it's only been used for about a month, but it certainly helped! Recently we've had a glitch which does not allow the word to be read or letter sounds to be heard, instead we're hearing background music. Hoping this gets resolved.",
My 2 yr old son loves this app that's why I paid for the full version but it doesn't download! It always says insufficient disk space. I have more than 4gb of disk space!!! Plus it always crashes. If you cannot fix this then refund me my money.,
"My two year old son loves this app. I purchased the extra word pack which is worth the money. He loves the silly letter Sounds & the creative definition animations. He has all of the endless reader apps. Graphic are great, sound is great. Galaxy S5",
"This is my 2yo favorite game. He could play this game for hours of I let him. In 1 week of playing this game, he has went from saying nothing to saying & sounding out over 10 letters. The full version is well worth the price.",
I like the game because it helps kids learn but if you have to pay money for all the stages other than the bery first ones then I don't think that small kids will learn anything other than spelling like 3 different words and they will have to do them each like three million times if they like the game because if you do not want to pay then the program will not have any stages. And that is not educational for children to keep learning the same words over and over.,
I just had to buy the full app. My 4 year old loves to play this game and it's so educational. I wish there were more games like this made with the intention for children to learn. I'm going to have to let all my son's parents know about this game.,
My 20 month old loves the animations and playful letters in addition to dragging them around. She has recently learned that if she drags the letters to the correct place she gets a cartoon and now she loves it and plays it every day :) great app.,
"I downloaded the LITE version and my 2 YO fell in love with it. As a teacher there is only 1 thing I'd change: once they drag the letters in place for it to then go through and spell the word and say the word one more time. BUT once I bought the full version the animation acting out the definitions stopped working. Nothing worse than a 2 year old tantrum over a beloved game not working. Please fix or refund. I emailed  they were able to walk me through fixing it, though it did take a few hours to redownload",
"And a fun fact is she's not even a native English speaker, but she loves the sounds and overall look of this game.  I've bought the full version and I'm hoping to see more words be added in the future!",
"My son tried the free version which he loved so I decided to buy the full version for 5.99, as soon as I purchased there was no animation after completing the word. If they fixed this issue, it would be great!  Update: contacted them about the issue and they responded very quickly and now app works great!! My 2 year old son LOVES it! Thank you!",
The app is great until they try to force you to pay $5.99 just for your kid to learn words past the letter C. If you're gonna start off as a free app then stay a free app. Don't waste your time with this app,
"So far so good (only have the free version). Crashed once so far but usually works great. I love that the letters make their own phonetic sounds and I'm hopeful it'll be a fun way to learn letters. The animations are my favorite! Cute, engaging, not annoying! I love love the little monsters!!",
"It's a fun, cute app that actually has some educational value. But $6.00 for the full version? That's a pricey app! And you're not getting any new features with the full version, just new words, so it seems like maybe $1 or $2 would be a lot more reasonable.",
Paid for the whole app but it just kicks me out and won't load. My son loves this game. I want help.,
Fun game that keeps kids involved and teaches the sounds of letters. It uses fantastic words and sentences. I've had it on my iPad since it first came out and was so pleased to see it on Android. I recommend it to everyone who has kids 1 to 10.,
"We bought this for my son finally after he played the trial version for like a year. He has autism and so we thought it would help him. He giggles at the letters as they make sounds, he figured it out really quick too. It's very easy for little fingers.  Once the words are matched there's a cute definition with animation following so they hear, see and are able to understand what the word means.  After buying the full version a couple weeks ago, he started using the word famished. I asked if he knew what it meant and he said yes, very hungry. I asked where he learned it and he just smiled. He used to say contraption when he was using the trial version. So he picks up on the words with it pretty quick.  It's totally worth the few dollars for the full version =)",
"But crashes ALL the time. My 18 month old LOVES this app. I thought she would just be getting abc practice, but she can work this app!! She actually does it like a puzzle and completes the words. And it's a great vocabulary builder, too! This teacher and momma a is a huge fan...minus the crashing!",
"This app was great when I had the free version. It keeps my almost 2 year old entertained, and he's learning how to match letters, just a matter of time before he's saying letters and spelling and reading!! I bought this app its the second app I've ever bought and I've had smartphone for 6+years!!! I love this. Thank you. Edit: he is now over two and he's saying all of the letters, he can spell small words like Eat, I have to thank this app for that, he still loves it. About to buy #'s app from you.",
"Not only fun, but very educational. They learn the letters, phonics, spelling and new words. Great for kids on the spectrum. My kids have had it for a couple of years and they still enjoy it.",
"I just purchased the endless alphabet. It was working fine but now after spelling the word the sentence animation doesn't appear. The background, audio, and buttons are there, but no picture. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it still doesn't work. PLEASE fix!",
"amazing, love these apps by originator. my 3yr old son is non-verbal and autistic and he has learnt so much wih these apps and i even starting to say the words he sees, i recommend to anyone with an autistic child, brilliant, great learning tool",
My 3 year old loves this! I only wish we found it sooner. Great app and he has already started to learn from it in just a few days...only problem is I can't  ever get him off of it,
I absolutely love this game for my child I actually can't stop playing it myself lol just for giggles,
My 3.5 year old started playing with it when she just turned 2. I credit most of her learning her abc's to this app. She loves it!,
Once we bought it the animations stopped working ... Avoid the disappointment to your little ones.,
"The game is great, catching kid's attention right away. It is good value for money, even if the words are too few. But the choice of words is strange - why more common words haven't been included, is beyond me...",
Once the full version is purchased the app crashes. My little guy can no longer play this game. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing. Very bummed and out the money it cost to buy it.,
"My now 2 yr old loves this app,  he started using it at the age of 1 . He now knows the whole alphabet. Thank you",
"BUT a great app like this should be free for the children, not just limited to three letters A-C.",
My two year old loves this app & is learning letters & words while having fun! My only complaint is that it sometimes freezes up & we have to restart.,
Love this app.  My three year old  loves to play and is already  learning to recognize  words and match letter sounds .,
"Skip and just get the endless reader for learning sight words spelled properly in lowercase. For the alphabet there are plenty other ways. Change the spelling of this app into lower case then I'll love it, until then I hate it. Children's books are not spelled in upper case last I checked. Need I say more?",
"My nearly two year old loves jt. Great for learning letters, be great if they had a version in lower case as well as upper. Highly recommend this app.",
"Good way to get my daughter involved with letters, she enjoys spelling with the fun animations and the words are hard but fun for her.",
"Why so many app developers forgot this....its quite simple thought to include this in design. Provide setting option on home screen, not on actual play UI",
"My two year old loved it and i loved that she was recognizing the letters but now that I've paid for the full trial it now crashes when opened. Please fix it! **update: i emailed tech support and they guided me along the steps, now its works great!!!!",
"My son loves this app, but every time I try to purchase the full version the app and the google play store crashes.  I would love if this could be fixed quickly.",
"Keeps my kid engaged. The animations are fun. Well worth the full version, although just keep in mind it really isn't endless.",
"My 2 year old loves this game, and she has learned a whole new vocabulary because of this app. The sound the U makes is annoying as all get out, but overall, it's little human approved.",
(Loved the free version enough to buy the full version and it still says downloading... So that's a waste...) EDIT: It took a few hours for the download to take effect but now I am thrilled and so is my little one!!!,
My 2 year old loves playing this game.  I also use it with my first and second grade class at school.  They love playing with it during thier free centers time.,
"My daughter loves this app. I paid and downloaded the rest of the words, but I wish you had additional word packs that I could download.",
As an app it is more than fun to play with But I could mot find a way to control the InApp purchases so if you are planning to play only the free words it may end up your kid buying the full version.,
"My son loves this app, especially the animations after finishing a word. We bought the extra words, was definitely worth it.",
My 2yo daughter loves this game. This is really healpful she already recognized the letters. And I also learned new words from this app. .,
"Such a great app, my 2 1/2 year old points out so many letters when were out and about. He knows about 10-15 letters by sight, maybe more. Love it.",
3 and 5 year old grandchildren believe they are playing games every morning when in reality they are learning.  They love it!,
"Engaged my son within the first 5 minutes of playing.   Phonics,  definitions of words and visual theatrics that show meanings of words.  Highly recommend this!",
it is perfect! We are playing it with my 2 years old son  and  he recognizes  almost all the letters from now. But i wish it is also have  turkish version.,
My son (2+) loves this game. It's glitchy and crashes regularly. But he has a ball playing it between crashes.,
Ok for a bit of fun but teaches the letter name rather than the sound which is preferable when children are learning to read. Also the words are not words you can sound out for example 'exercise'. Not great for young readers.,
A wonderful way to introduce words and reading to my preschoolers. They can't get enough and ask to play it all the time!,
My kids have learned quite a bit with it. Even my 1 and half year old can use it. Love it.,
I love this app. My 15 mo old is now repeating the sounds of the alphabet and it keeps his attention. He can even recognize some of the letters on his own. Will there be any chance of having this app in Spanish?,
"My 5 yo really struggles with letter recognition and sound, and this game addresses both. Also its silly and fun so keeps his attention. Bonus it teaches some vocab too!!",
Love the game for my 4 year old. I have NEVER paid for any app before however decided it was worth it for this because he learns so much. But they wont download correctly and app keeps closing!!!!!!! What is the problem,
My daughter loves this game. I bought it last year. Now she can't play. Continues to crash after 1 min of play time. When that gets fixed I'll rate 5 stars again.,
My Son loves this he knows all the letters and and the sounds because of this cool little monster game its made a bug difference it was worth every penny for the full version I could have stayed with the lite version but it was so good and my Jacob was picking up fast I just had to let him have access to all the letters :D Five stars!!!,
The only way this app could be better is to have all lowercase option.  I have watched my 3 year old play this and within minute he's making letter sounds with the app.  Fantastic!,
"Recommended by my daughter's speech therapist, this is one of the best apps I have seen for teaching children the alphabet!",
"After placing all the letters where they go, the app crashes. Needs an update to fix this, sad to pay for a great game for it not to work properly.",
Please add the possibility to have custom words! That way this app would be very good for learning English as a second language.,
It has everything you need for a curious toddler. Even a lock on the settings. Best game for small kids.,
I love this app. The update made it crap. No animation at the end at all now. Please fix.,
"I should've read the reviews in full first. The app seemed alright and it seemed to be taking effect really quickly, so I too purchased the additional letters of the alphabet and it says it's downloading, due to lack of space. First of all why do I need additional space for app to add something within the app?? And it's also force closing now day 2 that I've had the app on my phone.",
Paid the money but keeps quitting before it starts. Not happy,
Got this for my 1year old but will be helpful to her for years to come. Colourful and creative illustrations. Love it!,
"This is a great, simple educational game for the youngins. My now 3 year old has loved this game (and their others) since she was about 20 months old.",
I am trying get to enjoy this app that was first introduced to me through an IPad. I am feeling annoyed that I am not given the option of switching it to Spanish-language. The app it self is great just  other education I can't find the one from the iPad in my galaxy.,
Unable to watch most animation after completed the puzzle. Send email but till now no respond.,
"My daughter loves this app, thanks to this app (as well as other methods) she know knows all her letters and she's not even 2 yet. She's beginning to understand the sounds letters make thanks to this app as well.",
"I love this app. Would give 5stars if I could still use all the functions I've given money to use.   Have paid extra for the rest of the words, as well as the numbers app. But now it just keeps telling me they're downloading all the extra words/numbers and they can't be used.",
My child and myself love this app. She is two years old and started recognizing letters and sounds with ease thanks to the fun learning experience. Highly recommended.,
My daughter 19 months love it and now know all her letters and what sounds they make besides extending her vocabulary and familiarizing her with spelling. Best game I've found :),
"this app and all the originator Inc apps are garbage. spent $40 on full versions, and when my kid's tablet needed to be replaced, nothing transferred because they were ""in app purchases"" and those don't transfer between devices. so unless your kid is gonna use the same device forever, don't waste your money!",
"Its a great apps, its really helpful..if only we can choose the age segment in the setting so the letter for each alphabet can suits every age.. i mean like basic words for toddler and moving to a more complex words up the age..",
I adored this app until I purchased the whole app. Now cant see the word animations. This would be an easy 5 star if it worked right. Disappointed 😢,
My 3 year old loves this app! This really helps with his speech issues and allows him to build his vocabulary!,
"I've had this app (full version) for years. Recently, it is not working! My son loves this app and is so frustrated. It keeps freezing up and not doing the animation. Fix or refund my money, please!",
"My kids love the animations, the sounds, and the small puzzle of dragging the letters to the right places.",
I just wished you could do more things.,
"Really enjoy the app but disappointed that the words have NEVER been updated.  Cmon, now. Cant we have some new words? Wouldn't have paid had I known this nor would I buy another of their apps.",
Four year old loves playing this and has learned to read so many words!,
Had on iPhone   thx for adding to google!!  Great app. +++++ Update.   Tends to crash a lot,
Love the app but it keeps closing!! I paid $5 and my son can't play it because it won't stay open past the opening sequence. Very annoying.,
but it's not working properly anymore. It keeps freezing and the screen turns to static. Would love to give it 5 stars when the problem is fixed!,
My 1.5 year old knew all his uppercase letters thanks to this app:) He's 2 now and we are working on lower case letters which you can do with Endless Reader. Best educational app there is!,
I have tried many apps to teach alphabets and words to my child.... But this is a clear winner! Keep up the good work. Add more words please..,
"My toddler LOVED your game, so I payed the ridiculous price for it. Now it crashes after every word he completes.",
great for my 3 year old & 5 year old to learn phonics and new words. Keeps them entertained for good 20min,
I gave it 2 because my in app purchase is gone. I know I bought the whole endless series. Nobody likes to lose money. Otherwise   good for toddlers.,
Game is engaging and fun.  Easy for my son to understand,
It really works.But I can't buy all of the abcs.Just for an upgrade to be able to unlock with good spelling,
"Love that they include the Canadian pronunciation of z. Easy interactive game that keeps my 3 year old engaged. Bright colours, fun letters, sounds and animations.",
The app was working just fine before we purchased it. After we purchased the app began to crash and now it wont even open pass the main title screen. Can we get some help for this?,
This game was easily 5 stars until I spent the money to buy the words. None of the animations are working after the words and some of the words ended up being misspelled. A Y in the word exercise? Please fix my animations and I will be able to rate 5.,
"It's an awesome app on my daughters iPad. But, for a Nextbook Ares the screen goes black once the app loads up or if the word gets completed, it freezes the whole tablet.",
Would like have the endless spanish alphabet  on android. Hope they put it out. Saw it on youtube,
The farthest you can go in the game is letter c which is soooo....soooo... sad,
Exciting animation and cheerful music path the way for building phonics ability and a larger vocabulary.,
It opens good and all but after the first word it blacks out and I can only hear the word and letters but can't see anything!!,
My son loves this app! Especially the silly sounds the letters make!,
My 4 year old son absolutely loves this game. In fact it is helping him to read,
My baby has been playing this game since.she was 6 months... She is now very advanced and I seriously credit it to this game. Its awesomazing!!(her word),
"Creative, adorable, and engaging. My 2 yr old cannot get enough!",
Really like the ABC but should be available across devices when you pay for the app. Should be available on kindle.,
This is the perfect level of engagement with literacy without shoving it down their throat.,
Now it just says downloading and free space so I did! Still not working,
100% satisfied.  Creative and easy for my son to learn.,
My two year old knows his ABCs because of this app!  He loves it and I am thrilled!,
Love this app! Works perfectly and very educational. Thank you!,
And so do I! He can play this over and over and he loves it.,
I bought this app and don't have all the words,
Nice animation and great way of explaining stuff ❤,
My two year old had learned the names of all the letters thanks.,
My little 5 yo brover loves this it's fun for all the famaly,
Fun game for kids. And they might learn something too while playing it.,
Highly recommended my son was instantly in love with this and great learning tool.,
My 3 year olds vocabulary has expanded so much in such a short time,
My son enjoys it. I have it on my phone and hopefully I can upload it on my tablet.,
"It crashes a lot, but it's great for kids",
My daughter learned her letters from this app!!,
My 2 year old loves it. Her favorite app.,
Love this hopefully helps my daughter learn,
It worked earlier but now when my son tries to play it immediately closes,
Very kid friendly informative and lots of learning,
My 2 year old granddaughter loves this game and is having fun while learning so much!,
Road trips are so much easier with this app it definitely works well,
Greatest app ever!!! My kids never get tired of it.,
Please add more levels my student loves this game,
This app was free with all of the words a year or so ago. Now there are only a few words you can interact with and the rest are locked until you pay $5.99.... So sad and disappointed by this :(,
My 4 yr old is amazed by this!  Great app! She enjoys learning!,
3 yr old LOVES IT. So do I! Great art. Great methods.,
My son loves this game an his spelling has improved tenfold,
I got this for my sis Lexis she loves endless numbers so she will love this,
"My 2y son just love es it, definitely worth paying for the full version",
Helped my daughter and now my son thank you!,
My almost 2 yr old loves it!!,
Kids love it and it helps teach them letter sounds and reading and comprehension of the words,
So creative.  My kids really enjoy playing this.,
My soon to be 4 yr old loves this app.,

Great app guys... the whole family loving it,
Ethan Allen Des the best of luck. I am a,

Great for my son with special needs,
Emily B you are right! !,
...I can not get my prior purchase to register in my new device. What should I do?,
My son loves this app,
My son 4 years son love it,
My child really likes this app.  I like the art and it is well produced.,
"Brilliant, more words please",
Nice app but unsure how the sounds match those taught at primary school which might confuse?,
"Update: 2 year old is so bored of the free demo. She won't touch the games now. Knowing iphone has more words is disappointing. There's only one 'O' word?! Add: 'our', 'your', 'mine', 'their', etc. Plus you can tack on for more $$$: 'ere, 'ey 're, etc. ending words. Add math words and shapes. Addition, subtract, you have 'multiply' down already. Until then it's not worth 6$ each",
Best app for kids...,
Great fun and learning for the kids!,
Endless alphabet App Store Game,
My son loves this app!,

Our daughter is three and really interested in words and phonics. She loves the animation and her sight word recognition is definitely improving. We did buy all available in-app purchases because there aren't many words available with the initial download. Love the app but it comes at a steep price if you want all that it has to offer.,
This is a very well put together app. The letters make their sounds as they are moved around and say their names when put in to place. The animations are cute and my five year old really seems to like it. The price is high for an app but I feel is worth it. Their help with issues has been fantastic and same day during the week so far.  I only hope that they continue to add words to it.,
I purchased this app in 2015 and it quickly became my daughters favorite. A couple of weeks ago I stepped on her tablet and order her a new one. Same kind as the first (Sprout Cubby) only this time the app isn't compatible with the device. all the free apps I downloaded from Originator were compatible but the only one I paid for and we truly enjoyed didn't. really disappointed.,
You didn't always have to pay for this app.  We've had it on our I phones and iPad for awhile and my daughter has loved it.  My issue is that while we had it on our iPad it seemed like it truly was an endless alphabet and now that I have it on my Samsung phone it is so limited.  It seems to me like because of the popularity developers got greedy and now charge for the full version.,
"I do love this, my kids are engaged by it. I do wish it spelled out the word once more after they were finished it so that the kids would get the idea that a word is spelled from front to back. Not just their favorite sounding letters first. And I had the full ipad version first and even when you have the the full version the new words were veeeerey long in coming.",
"Soo it cost more for this App on Apple than it does on Android, so I thought I had the upper hand on my husband. Apparently the Apple App has a lot more words, and letter pixie dust after spelling the word. But overall still love this app. My 22 month old can identify all letters, and is anxious to read",
"Android version of the app routinely crashed on my Galaxy Note 3 and on my Galaxy Tab. My 2 year old loves it, but can only play for a few minutes before it crashes. Would consider paying for full version (which I rarely do) but only if it didn't crash all the time.",
Please do something to disable the house button as one or more letters are being dragged. The house button should activate only if it is *first* to get touched *and* let go before another touch. Otherwise it is nearly unplayable for my 2 year old. He doesn't know how to tell he's accidentally hitting the button.,
What a fun app for my 3 year old! I wish it would work! Bought this and it worked for a few minutes and then froze and now just opens with a black screen. VERY frustrating to spend money on something that doesn't work. You shouldn't have to pay for this. I reinstalled and seems to be working so I gave it another couple stars because we really like this app.,
"This game has a wonderful premise and beautiful artwork. People who complain that there aren't enough words are using it with kids that are too old. It's perfect for my two year old. It takes her a long time to do each word, and she loves watching the letters dance.",
"Initially brilliant but soon becomes apparent that there's no structure, just seemingly random words like contraption and bellow. If they could create categories to chose from like colours and animals etc. And roll with those, It would be fantastic.",
"One of the better apps available for a 2 year old. Keeps my 2 year old engaged and encourages learning new words, meanings.  I would want to upgrade my rating to 5 stars if couple of things are fixed a) random crashes (not frequent though) b) force closes if the screen is turned off and then turned on c) any provision to add more words :)",
From my 10 yr to my 8 and 5 yrs old. This is super cool I am in love with the word choice. Awesome animation buy this app. Oh yeah I love that you include all the different sounds each letter has alot of ppl don't know that it's an effective part of learning sounds of letters because all programs don't teach it and your the second I've ever seen do it Thanks keep um coming.,
"Updated: it won't let get full access to the words, despite purchasing them on my nexus tablet. Hope they resolve the issue soon.",
"We got the Endless apps when our son was 21 months. Within a month here, he knows all of his letters, can recite them up to J on his own and can count up to 10. I am truly astonished and so full of joy to see his little brain developing. Plus, he loves laughing at the funny cartoons acting out the words, like ""Odor"".",
"This app has obviously been put together by people who know and think about what they are doing. Great animations and graphics, great sounds and a well thought-out methods for learning. Really appreciate this app and can't wait for any more from the same group. A cut above the rest - no doubt. Totally recommend it.",
"Because the full version of the game can only be obtained through an in-app purchase, and because restricted profiles on Android devices disallow communication with the play store, I can't figure out a way to unlock the full version for my daughter's restricted profile on my Nexus 7. Otherwise, a great APP.",
"My 2yo loves this,  but it's very hard for him to play on my phone. It also has buttons too close to the letters, so he goes back to the home screen too easily when trying to move the letters. It works much better for him on my wife's ipad, which has a bigger screen.",
"This is mostly for older children,  but my two year old niece loves to play with this game.  She doesn't know the letters but can see the difference between the shapes of the letters.  The animated clips are really great and she enjoys watching them.  When she spells the word she will clap and enthusiastically  verbally celebrate what she did.  I did pay for the upgraded version of the game.",
My daughter plays this whenever she gets my phone and it really enabled her to learn her abc's. She is almost 2 and has learned almost ALL of her letters. Whenever we go out in public she is always pointing out letters. Please bring the Reader and Number apps to Android I beg you!,
My 3 year old started playing this game when he was 2 and he loved it so much. So I downloaded Endless Reader...now not only does he know all the letters he knows all the sight words and is reading. Hes far more advanced than other 3 year Olds. I'm do excited for endless numbers!,
"I have two kindergarten aged students with CAS and Dyslexia respectively that LOVE this app. My student with dyslexia loves that the letters each have a ""face"" so he can associate an otherwise unrecognizable letter with a character, and my student with CAS just loves to practice modeling the sound that goes with the letter. And they both love spelling and reading the words, which can be a feat with struggling spellers and readers! Great app!",
I recommend this to anyone with small children. It helped or cold learn her abc's faster then I ever dreamed. They have other apps to help with words and numbers that aren't available on Android (that I've been able to fine yet) Waiting for those to release here also.,
This game is absolutely perfeft  for my 2 year old. She has learned all the letters and sounds so quickly! I do wish there would be a way parents could input the child name into the game. That would make the $3.99 price tag more worth it :),
"One of my older daughter's former teachers suggested this app for my younger daughter at a reading clinic. While initially impressed, after downloading I found there were very few words available. I decided to buy ($2.99),on the promise /premise that there would be somewhat ENDLESS words and other types of letter activities. No, the words are limited and aren't of any specific context or subject and scrambled spelling is the only game. In the end my 5 year old likes it.",
Absolutely love this app. My son is 22 months old and it's his favorite app. He now recognizes letters and the sounds they make and points out every letter he sees. I am surprised at how quickly he was able to pick it up. Worth every penny and then some. And it is so cute and not at all annoying like many other toddler games. Was a little sad to see the apple version received new words and the Android has not yet. But otherwise we love this.,
"My daughter is 1year and 7 months old. And she loves this app she is learning how to recognize letters and knows how to spell them now I am mind blown when I see her putting words together like contraption, artistic, demolish, and others. I purchased all other words wich was 4.99$ wich is fair for what it's teaching my baby thank you very much for this app. I'm very happy with it and recommend it go all parents",
"My daughter really shocked me when she started easily doing the puzzles. She is almost 2.5 and repeats the words, letters and sounds. It's wonderful and totally worth paying for. The free version only offers a couple words but I am happy I opted to buy the full version!",
"This is an essential game for all toddlers, my son loves it and it teaches him a lot that has translated into other games which he in which he is also thriving. He has been playing it for a little under a year now and he has yet to get bored with it. Thank you! He loves Endless Reader and Endless Numbers too!",
"Bought this while on holiday because my little girl loved the free version so much, and it entertained not just her (only just 6) but her sister enjoyed it too, and she's 9. If your kids like the free version, then they'll love the unlocked one.",
My 2 year old started playing this on my mothers ipad and so I downloaded the free version and my daughter kept wanting the full version so I got it and it drastically changed her. She points out letters everywhere telling me what they are she is only 2 and knows her whole alphabet including w I was really impressed,
"My friend introduced me to this app on her I pad about 10 months ago but we have Androids so i was very disappointed when it wasn't available.  Since then I have checked occasionally to see if it had been made available because I was so impressed with it, I was delighted to see it had been added.   I have a strict ""no paying for apps"" policy and this one changed my mind.  There have been countless free apps that i try out only to delete shortly after because they are annoying or subpar for what I am looking for for my son.  I love the cute animations, graphics, sounds, definitions and words in this app. It doesn't talk down to my son which I adore. This app is worth the cost where others fall short, we appreciate the work put into it to make it engaging and educational, one of the best I have seen.",
I love the interactiveness of the program and the big words.  The videos send my children laughing for hours. they talk about it for days after.  Unlike iPad...the android will not update with new words.  We are stuck with the same 26 words and my kids have gotten bored.  I don't know why android is so limited.,
My son (just turned 2) absolutely loves the app and has been using it for several months now. I'd LOVE some type of expansion pack with more words (I'd happily pay). I also really wish Endless Reader was available on Android!,
This app is amazing for teaching little ones the abc`s. The monster letters are very cute and make the sounds of each letter.  This also helps broaden your childs vocabulary when it not only tells you the word but gives a definition and plays an animation to give an example.  My 3 yr old son loves this app and I love how much he is learning from it.,
My just barely 2 year old learned his letters and can put them in the right places on the game no problem.  He can identify his letters and tell me what most of them sound like. What is even cooler is he is learning site words.  He can tell me what the word is on the game but he can also point them out when he sees them in other places. LOVE this app. It's fun to play with your kiddo too which he loves. Can't say enough about this app.,
This app is truly amazing. My two year old has been playing for a few months and she started recognizing letters everywhere for example on my t shirts signs on the street. Store signs and she knows the sounds I think she's a step away from reading. The only downside is the amount of words  I would love if there were more and it would help expand her vocabulary. If there were more words I'd rate 5 stars.,
"We have this app on my 9-year-old's iPad.  We downloaded it for free from iTunes.  All 3 of my kids love this (ages 9, 6, and almost 3).  We have enjoyed the free updates with new words.  When I got my S4 Galaxy, I decided to download it so my youngest would have access to it when his sister had the iPad at school.  My disappointed started when I realized that the free download on Google Play only included letters A, B, and C.  So I paid the $4.99 to get the ""full"" version or what I thought was the full version.  I now have letters A-Z but I do not have all the words that we have on the iPad.  I am not sure why, but I am disappointed with the Android version of this app.  5 stars if you are getting it for an Apple product, 3 stars if it is for Android.",
"He asks to ""play letters"" all the time. It's a guilt free way to get a little free time to prepare dinner or to make it through the grocery store. The words aren't endless, but I think he would be overwhelmed with any more. The sounds and graphics are great. So glad I bought this one!",
My daughter was 1 years old when she started this app. It is very entertaining and even I laugh at the demonstrations. It keeps her occupied for a long period of time as there is much to do. It taught her the shape and name of the letter. It also sounds out the letters as she puts it into its place. Also it teaches words and their definition. She learned one of her favorite words from this app (scary). She has learned a lot and has put her ahead in her 1 year old and now 2 year old daycare class. I highly recommend this app and this developer. She is                           now using the Endless Reader app. I wish the Endless Numbers app was on Android!,
"This is fun and entertaining but it would be nice if there were 1) more words than the 50, a lot of which are irrelevant to a toddler  2) smaller words that a toddler sees and/or uses daily.  Basics... i.e. milk, car, banana. 3) the ""background"" music could be quieted, muted, or eliminated.  We'll be watching and waiting for updates.",
"The lack of a quit or exit button is a big no-no. And they really need to add more words. If not, at least add word updates for those who paid. This would definitely be one of the best educational apps out there if they could fix those things. 3 stars for now.",
"People are amazed that my 2 year old already knows her numbers but I have to give the credit to this app! She loves it and would play it 24/7 if I let her. The creators did a great job here, definitely appeals to and teaches my little one. :)",
"My kids love it but the background music keeps playing even when you switch to another app or turn the screen off. So you have to go in and kill the app every time you use it. If the tablet is in the back seat, you're going to be listening to it for an unbearably long time. Fix and it's four or five stars.",
"If spending a few bucks gets my kid to be advanced in reading heck yes! My kid didn't talk much and now he is beyond putting sentences together spelling his name these cartoons now n days are crap for kids, so for him to  find something so enjoyable and educational 3.00 a month is better than them failing I'd rather see them thrive.",
"I initially only downloaded the free/trial version, but when my daughter came up to me and was using the words from this app (such as contraption) in proper sentences I was convinced to purchase it. It was very expensive (720 Japanese yen) but it is the first educational app that I have been impressed enough with over the last 3 years to actually purchase.",
"Our sons really like playing it.  I really like the pedagogical approach.  It looks fun, it teaches basic phonics, letter recognition, spelling, and vocabulary.  Well worth the $5.    However, the in-app purchase doesn't work properly on a tablet with multiple accounts.  My kids use restricted accounts and I set access in terms of apps, internet access, ability to purchase, etc. Typically I buy the app on my profile and give them access to the app on their profile.  I did so with Endless Alphabet and got full access, but my kids restricted accounts still only have access to the demo. I can't give them have access to my account as I have banking apps, full purchase/internet access, and other stuff 2-year olds can cause trouble with.  Support advised me to ""turn on purchases"" and rebuy the app if the accounts were not truly restricted, otherwise await a technical google fix. I'm waiting and you may be too.",
"I can't describe how fantastic this game is for my daughter. She's 2 years and two months and can count to twenty, and knows bigger numbers, and words and a few sentences that I solely attribute to these Endless games. I'm a very involved father in her life hourly, and we play these together, but she repeats the spoken words, numbers and phrases and has learned at lot directly from these games. I'm happy I gave my hard earned money to these developers.",
"My 1 1/2 year old is so excited to move and complete each word then he watches only his favorite actions. Each day his speed is faster....NOW for those complaining you cannot expect and infinite amount of words with animation even for $3. After you child MASTERS moving their ABC have how about having them MASTER phonics, definition, comprehension, understanding before complaining about more words being added",
"When i saw this downloaded by my sister i was so amazed! And my 1yr old daughter loves it so much and my sister asked me to download it too. I did and when i finished the ""C"" its asking for payment, and its worth paying for.. Im looking for my daughter to play it in a big tablet ^_^ Good job whoever made this.. We so love it! And the sound effects they are soooo cute! Many thanks!",
"Don't get me wrong I like the app, it's educational and entertaining for my daughter, but endless it is not.  I expected more words, as did a lot of people if you read the reviews.  I also feel that android users are being neglected, as the iPhone version has gotten way more love from the devs, whereas the android version hasn't seen anything in nearly a year.  Also, if the devs aren't going to keep updating this app, I'm definitely not spending the big bucks required for the word packs in Endless Reader!",
"My 3 year old LOVES this game. Really lovely graphical style and cut scenes when you complete a word, however there are far too few words and no difficulty setting. Would be nice if you had the option to start with 3 letter words and work up to the more difficult ones."" This is why it only gets 4 stars from me, but definitely worth the small price. I'd be happy to review the Star rating should an update with more words be released.",
This is by far the best and most educational app my child has used. It teaches them the sounds of each letter for its designated word and its definition in a fun and funny way that attracts the childs interest to learn more as they go. I fell in love with this app since my child used it the first time. I do wish they would add endless words (hence the name) to it or create a part 2 of this app for children who have mastered these words and letters. Whoever created this app knows how to work with children an,
I really like this app but some aspects are counterintuitive to the way that children are taught to recognise letters e.g. I'm always being told that teaching children letter names instead of sounds is bad (bee vs bh for example).  Capital letters are also bad apparently. So if I could change these features to suit what my kid was being taught it would be much better. It would be good if you could choose the accent of the voiceover too...,
"My 2 year old daughter is rather willful and would refuse to learn the alphabet - she actually specifically avoided trying to learn it. Seriously. We made an alphabet chart for her, and whenever an adult would sit to point out letters, she would cover her ears and go 'blah blah blah - I don't want to learn my abcs' - same with pointing out letters in books, our alphabet puzzle, etc. Anyway, until 2 days ago, she only knew about 6 letters (that she would let on). She started to play with this app yesterday - she has now identified 15 letters. I'm ashamed to say the app is doing a better job than I am, but if it works, I'll take it. :-)",
Crashes on galaxy s5 during intro if I tap on screen.  My daughter likes the game alot. I guess it wouldn't be too much to ask for more words considering the cost.  I love the audio and the interactivity is snappy.  4 stars only for the buggy intro.,
This app is amazing!! I know it's frustrating that you only get so many letters on the free download but it's truly worth the buy!! My daughter is 2 and she absolutely loves it. It's helped her a lot with learning her letters and words/sounds. I would recommend it for anyone looking for an amazing learning game for their kid(s),
I love this app! I tried several other apps and none of them hold a candle to this game! My 5 year old really struggled with his letters and this game helped him learn them so much faster then my flash cards were. My 4 and 2 year old also love the game it was well worth the extra money to get the paid version! Just pay the 1 time fee you will not be disappointed!,
"My daughter loves this but I REALLY wish it reinforced that letters need to go in order from left to right.  It could either force doing left to right by locking all but the space that should be next until the letter is placed, then unlocking the next space, or (like another reviewer said) just spell out the word once it has been completed.  Also, after reading the reviews, I am so confused about what will be available if I buy the android upgrade.  Will I get all 50 words if I buy the upgrade?",
"I purchased the full version by paying for it. When I enable it for my kid's restricted profile, even after downloading the additional content in the admin profile, it errors out in the restricted profile. Waste of money if my kid cannot use it. No warnings when you purchase it that it doesn't work in restricted profile. No way to contact the developer either.",
"I purchased this app twice and it shows I have to purchase it yet again! I let their support team know this and they were very snarky. There are far better learning apps out there for your kids, so please don't use ANY originator apps.",
"I bought the entire word package, then my tablet crashed and had to be restored... now i no longer have the content, i emailed originator about the problem and they told me that it would update... i left it open and on wifi all night, it didnt update... so i wrote them back, they replied that it would update... i have waited two weeks now, no update, my little girls keep asking where their words are... why they cant just push the button to return my content I don't know, but I wish they would... upset...",
Great quality app that is adorable and keeps my one year old daughter engaged. She can match some letters already and knows A and E and a few other letters. You can really tell that the developers worked hard on this app. Love the artwork and the sound effects.,
"He would sit for as long as you let him, putting those letters back into place. Now, he's running around sounding out letters he sees on signs!  Only two drawbacks: - it's quite easy to accidentally press the home button when dragging letters, doesn't seem to phase my son though - it does sometimes crash",
My two year old daughter could play this none stop. shes been playing it for a year & just watching her learn to put letters where they belong was amazing! It is really a unique game definitely when you purchase all the words. Definitely worth it. Every once in awhile it freezes my phone so i have to restart it.. but its not something I'd get rid of it over,
My four year old who is starting to read loves this game. My two year old can't do it yet. He struggles to line up the letters. Just a trial. You have to pay $5 to unlock all levels...I think it's worth it though.,
Absolutely loves this app. DEFINITELY worthwhile purchase. His vocabulary is advanced for his age but still LOVES to tinker around with this app and we've had it over a month. I've seen him tire of video or PC games faster :-),
Hope theres a lower case version bcz my Boy who just turned two knows the Alphabet  but just the UPPER case version lol. He learned through this app He Loves it. Got a paid version on the ipad and the free version on 2 android. He's much interested in this app than me  teaching him.,
"I bought the full alphabet on an older phone, but now I have a new phone and it doesn't recognize my gmail.  Please give me what I paid for just because you change devices doesn't mean you should lose what you paid for, please fix thx",
First off if you buy this app it only works on the device you bought it on. If you uninstall it or get a new phone it makes you pay every single time. My rating was 5 stars now it's a 0 stars if they had one. Tech issues: Home button is too big and in an awkward place my son kept hitting it. This is the most incredible app I've ever seen and my son loved it. Whoever created this needs to use their brain because there are a lot of amateur mistakes. Oh and you have the price listed for 5.99 but it was 4.99.,
"My 23 month old adores this app. It helps him learn letters, letter sounds, how to spell words and definitions of words he would not normally hear. This app does it all by reaching multiple intelligences by using verbal, visual, kinesthetic and musical techniques. Plus it's quirky and unique so it teaches in a way that is fun for both the child and the parent. Only issue is it often has an error and has to be exited and re started. Can't wait for this company to put out Endless Reading on Google play!",
"I have 3 kids 7 and under. This app helped my 7 yr old with his letters, and their sounds. My 5 yr old is starting kindergarten this yr already ahead of her class. And my 2 yr old is repeating words and letter sounds while they take turns playing. It's awesome!!",
I love this app. Seeing my daughter get so excited after solving the word makes me so happy. She is 2.5yrs old and is killing it with this app! Would have given 5 stars but the app crashes a lot across multiple devices. Please update and fix! $5.99 deserves a %100 working app...,
"My daughter loves this app, she comes back to it over and over again. She's even picked up on some of the vocab in the app. Just a note to others, you'll have to pay to get the full alphabet but its not terribly expensive and is well worth the money. A lot of time and effort has clearly gone into this app so why not pay a little for it. This app won't teach your kids the alphabet, or phonics but it will reinforce what you teach them. As others have noted there aren't an endless number of words, but there are plenty and many more can be overwhelming. If the point of the app is to teach letters and some sounds you don't need a lot of different words. The words that are included have animations which clearly provide context and are fun.  Now I'd just like the other apps Originator has made for iOs to come over to Android.",
"I love that the selection of words is so many. My 3yr old loves the sounds the letters make & dragging the letters, animations are too cute. He giggles at them. That's all I care about, that he's having fun learning!",
"My daughter loves this game, spends hours playing it now I have paid to unlock all the words which is worth the money btw. Its helping her speech as shes non verbal and hopefully in time she will progress perfectly.   I have heard about Endless Reader and wondered when this will be available on android?",
"In summary, Endless Alphabet is a brilliant app.  Our two boys (6 and 4) love it and keep going back to it.  It's mildly educational, but mostly just really good fun.  Endless Alphabet contains a wide variety of alphabetised words that are definitely different from your usual ""a is for apple"".  The aim is to rebuild each word once all the letters have been dislodged.   Some of the sounds the letters make, and the letter animations that go with them, are really very funny... especially if you're a child (or a child at heart!).  It's not quite the phonetic sound of the letter, but it's a useful guide to the child as to what the letter is.    Once the word is complete an animation starts which describes the word.  The animations are again brilliant and really help to explain the meaning of the word in a very clear way.  Our boys have developed some clear favourites, with 'yodel' and 'kazoo' being high on the list!  The selection of words is a real highlight as several are fairly obscure (for children at least) or describe quite complex subjects.",
"Willow, my daughter, seems to have trouble with a few letters here and there. Thus I got this cute little app to see if it would help her get better associated. She likes how the letters move and make the sounds of the letters as you put them in place. It doesn't have to have 500 words to be effective... and its not like you spent a lot of money on it. Don't be so cynical. //// i would be willing to buy the other app if they put it on google play. Good job guys!",
My 2yr loves this. Only thing I wish they did is live up to the games name and add new words so it would be an endless alphabet.  However that aside the audio is perfect. Kid friendly controls with removal of the OS keys which make it less likely for the child to get out of the game by mistake. Great animation. Explication of every word and acted out. Every letter generates the sound you need to use when speaking or sounding it out. My son is even starting to copy each sound and tell me how to do it.,
"This app is great, but it freezes up my phone 50% of the time, and I've almost had to do a factory reset to get it working again. For a paid app, glitches like that should not exist.",
"I love, love, love this app. We got it free on our iPad when it first came out, and am installing it now on my Android device. It's one of the few apps I would glad pay for. Brilliantly conceived and so well done. My little one started playing it when he was about 18 months as a puzzle and matching shapes activity, but it quickly helped him recognise his alphabet. Now he's learning the words through the animation. By far my favourite educational  app. Looking forward to the Android version of Endless Reader",
"My children love the Innovator Inc. Apps - I have a 2 & 3 year old who would bite my arm off to play them on my phone, use them occasionally at home and when we're in a dentist /doctor waiting room. Both now know all the letter names, phonic sounds and they can do basic reading and spelling. It's set them up for school and they've loved every second of it!",
"My little one loves this app. We use a new word that she learned from it as our word for the day.  However,  there is limited words after the upgrade.  She enjoys the definition accurate and child friendly. The monsters are just adorable.  :) ♥ new favorite app of hers",
"My two year old loves this app, and she is even using some of the words and recognizing some letters of the alphabet. It has been a lifesaver when we are out in public and things haven't gone as planned (waiter taking too long, long lines at the grocery store, etc) to placate her a bit longer. Wish they would add more words, especially since their website says there would be new words/monsters added weekly.  UPDATE: iPhone gets updated with new words, but costs $6.99, so...",
"First, amazingly designed app. But recently you keep interrupting my child's use of the game to ask a three year old to rate the app. What's jackaloon fool decided that was a good idea? Love having my child forced into the Play Store. So you guys get a 1 star until you fix this...",
"Great app for my 2 year old, she loves it and it's educational! Tried her on the free levels first before buying the rest. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it has crashed twice. Not a lot compared to usage though at all.",
"My 3 year old stumbled upon this game on a display tablet at the store. After watching her play it for a few minutes, I decided to buy the full version for her. She absolutely loves it, as do I! This is the best children's game I have found yet. It's creative, beautifully designed, and most importantly it teaches your kid the alphabet in a very fun way. Best 3$ I've ever spent. You guys have something to be proud of here, excellent job. I've purchased the full game on three different devices now just to show my appreciation.",
This is an expensive app and it is very annoying for it to close after being open for 30 seconds!  Its not worth the trouble to turn my phone off then back on to find the app again for my kid to have it do it again!!!  It has ootential to be a cool app but for now I wsh I could just get my money back!,
My 2 year old is in love with this app! He can put all the letters on all the words! BUT.... there needs to be a lock on the HOME BUTTON! He always has to start over spelling the word when he accidentally grazes the home button! Grrrrrrrrrrrr! Fix and all 5 star it quickly!,
Disappointing you have to pay for a full version so my children can learn. Deleting and telling everyone about the rude and horrible customer service! I will never put any money into this small team (5) and will be sure everyone I know is aware.,
"This is an awesome app, but I wish it had more words.  My son has already gone through most of them.",
Endless alphabet started our little addiction. My 2 and 3 year old both love the games. I only wish that all of the apps were available on android. It's a little difficult for them to play on my phone and they usually want to play it on the tablet. Please make endless reader and endless numbers available for android!,
Good animation good sound. Rate need to come down to $1 to $2. Some offer requires for group buy.  Overall very good and interesting  application.,
"This teaches letter names not letter sounds.  The choice of words are not phonetically regular e.g. Children are asked to spell the words ""celebrate"" and ""cooperate"". Shame as the graphics are cute.  If your child is learning to read or spell using phonics,  this app will just confuse them. Avoid.",
"My 2 year old is understanding sounds of letters and she's learning the vocabulary! She has a lot of fun while playing. It did take her awhile to figure it out, but now that she has, it's one of her favorite things to do. Compared to a lot of apps out there, I like this the best so far!",
"I'm a teacher and got this for learning support work. However, some of the phonics are confusing eg L is luhluhluh and R is ararar. Adding vowel sounds to the basic consonant sound is confusing for students learning to read and blend sounds. Lower case would have been nicer too. Animations are beautiful though!",
"I wish I could come hug the person who made this ap. My 2 year old boy who refused to repeat words just a few months ago, now tries to repeat every word he completes and I truly believe its the reason he has started talking. The ap is so fun for kids, and it drills the sound of each letter in there lil brains and helps them put together words in a way that's fun and makes them want to do it again and again! My son is an absolute pro at it now and wants to play it for hours. Absolutely best ap ever!!",
Boring and only a few words are free. Should just t charge straight up then you know what you're dealing with.,
"While my 2year olds love playing this game and learning their letters, the words are a little advanced for them. I wish I could adjust the word difficulty or perhaps even be able to enter my own, age appropriate words...",
"When the little blue guy toots his horn in the intro, my one year-old laughs, every single time. It was worth the money for that alone, but it has really helped us to distract her during a very long stay at the children's hospital. Thank you for all of the work you put into this app! I wish there were more Originator titles for Android.",
An excellent app my child has enjoyed since age 4. This teaches spelling and pronunciation in a fun interactive way. A little bit goofy mixed with a little bit educational equals a lot of fun for young people.,
Bought full version for £3.49 my youngest daughter loves only problem app tends to freeze at times average twice a week other than that it's very good,
"My brother loved this game so much! Even though your child doesn't understand the word they are trying to teach you, it is still a very fun game for toddlers. I hope you like this as much as my brother does! BTW, my brother is 2 years old. I bet that this game will entertain until they are.",
I was expecting that the app will add new words with each update. But its stuck to the same worlds. It should get word updates.,
This game is amazing.  I bought the full version.  My 3 year old Saya ask these amazingly big words and it impressed her day care teachers.  Buying the endless reading app asap. Had this app for a year. Love it.  Best money I've spent on an app!,
"This is a very quality app.  The combination/integration of letter recognition, letter sounds and word definition makes it well worth the expense of full edition.",
"My daughter started playing with this at 18 months and loves it. The only issue is the presence of the Home button, which she'll invariably touch while reaching for a nearby letter, eliminating the progress she's made on that word. Perhaps a confirmation popup or moving it to a hidden menu would help.",
"My daughter loves spelling the wprda. More words would be great, but I still feel the app is worth the cost",
"I downloaded this onto my iPad for some children that I was tutoring. Fast forward two years, I'm with another set of children and remember this app because it's so engaging and adorable. Very disappointed to find that now I have to pay! I know its not much but...",
"My 3 year old has loved this for a while, and keeps rediscovering it, with recognition for more letters.  Highly recommended, as a fun game that fosters learning too. I learn from it too, as had no idea kazoos even existed before this game! Now we have a ciuple to make fun noises with!",
"I love this game for my kids. My only complaint is that it takes up so much space and processing power. Still worth it, though.",
"I have downloaded ALOT of educational apps for my son, he is 2 1/2. He LOVES this app and has soo much fun with it! This app really is by far the best. They cover all bases with their words, from saying the word and sounding out each individual letter,  to depicting and explaining the word. It really is phenomenal!! Graphically great as well! Well worth the buy! I wish it had a couple more letters in the trial. Its an educational app and some aren't as fortunate. And this is a great app to miss out on =)",
"I really like this game and so does my daughter. I wish there were more words. Also, the dragging motion used sometime s results in my child exiting the app. It has also frozen a few times causing me to have to reboot my phone.",
"This game is adorable.  It is one that my 18month old goes to constantly.   At this age I don't believe in flashcards, but I still try to expose her to letters/numbers/colors whenever I can.   She hasn't gotten the hang of moving the letters herself... but just seeing mommy do it, she says the sounds of many letters first when she recognizes them. Update * 26 mo - still loves, can move the letters on her own.  Lots of times when we do letter ID work.. she will sound them out ""ga ga ga G""  and she only got that from this app.",
"My daughter  loves it, also really nice effects. 2 things bother me though: when you hit home button accidentally then theres no confirmation, it just goes to ""home"" without the chance to resume. This isn't big problem as it's simple game but i've seen my kid being upset about it. Other problem is that the game freezes up at random points and i have to restart it - this is why i can't give 5 stars.",
"I just paid $11.99 for the expansion pack, level 1, 1-4.  Now the game is a mess! Missing words that didn't download, missing sound for words that did, and the 'endless' error message telling me that ""Unfortunately, the game has stopped""... Wow, am I disappointed, as will be my 4 year old! It's a shame, since the other 2 Endless games are wonderful. Now how do I go about fixing this mess?",
"My daughter really likes this app, would be nice if the background music changed sometimes. Hope there's a numbers version coming out soon. Great app.",
"My grandchildren ans I enjoy this goofy little alphabet app. It's a hoot, and I highly recommend it.",
My toddler refuses to put her tablet down after getting this. It really has helped her learn her letters. She loves the funny sounds they make and the stories describing each word.,
"My 2 year old loves this app, along with its cousin, endless words. It has great animation, and silly sounds that entertain.",
My 3yr old loves this app but I wish it had more words. If it had more words I would have given it 5 stars. I have Android and it frequently stops.,
Child has improved so much. He loves this app. It's like he isn't even learning it's so fun to him. The way the all is set up is very easy for kids to operate on own.,
Great game. My 18 month knows all the letters now. I wish there were more words and the option to switch to lower case letters though.,
"3 yr old son will sit for hours on this app. It is so cute and it makes us laugh. Love how it sounds each letter out while he drags it to its place in the word, then says the letter when he drops it.",
The app is definitely doing its job at least teaching him the phonics portion of it but it also is helping them identify letters as well he's only 18m I would definitely recommend this app to anyone my only complaint would be that the music is repetitive. Also you guys should definitely do it hiragana version of this!!,
It's a fun and educational app. Both my daugther and I love it she get to learn her letter and I get her to learn new words.,
"He will mess with it for hours and when its over, he grabs books and points out letters and sounds. Excellent app. gET IT",
"Few words available on the free version, with a cost of $6 to unlock the rest. No thanks, I can use homemade flash cards and have actual interaction with my child instead.",
"My 6 year old has used this app since he was 4. Its beautiful, well done & easily expands their vocabulary. I love the way each letter is sounded out first, put together, sounded out AND then defined & used in a sentence. SUPERB!",
"Only thing better could be more words and, some alternate activities to just word scrambling. 2 and 4 yr old both love it anyways.",
I stumbled upon this and i purchased it for my kids. I tell every single parent about this app..it really helps with letter recognition.,
I got this on Apple app store and I love it. My 2year old kid is learning and having fun with this app. Therfore I have got this on windows and now on android.,
My 2 year old daughter loves this game but its frustrating for her seeing all the other words n letters she can't play. She doesnt understand they cost money.  Its for children come on!!,
Saw a friend's boy playing this so I downloaded it for mine and he can't get enough. Great game for learning,
My son started playing this at 9 months just cause he loved the animation and he learned all his letter sounds by 15 months old. Now at nearly two its still his favorite app. He particularly  love contraption and dye.,
I bought this and love it but I recently got new devices and can't download it and the other endless games on either. Please help,
My daughter was struggling with recognizing her alphabet. After weeks of trying to help her my friend suggested this app. Within a day of playing this on and off (at her own request - she loved the app) she could recall most of the letters instantly.,
I have installed this app on my note 3. It doesn't work properly it keeps crashing. If this is what I am getting in return of spending 6.99 than it is not worth. Seems like app developer doesn't care for android users.,
"I noticed that originator has fully focused on the iPhone side of these games and apps, but left the android high and dry... Don't they know the market share of android is more than iPhone.. so why commit to their applications when everyone is switching.. bad business decision",
The only issue I have is the video at the end of the word doesn't play. I'm not too worried about cause my son doesn't know it's supposed to play. I even paid the extra cause he loves it so much.,
"My daughter really loves this app, I think it's really adorable but I'm only giving a 3 star because I paid for the rest of the letters (i think $5.00) and the problem I am having is that my daughter will only be in the app for like a minute and then it will freeze up and say ""unfortunately endless ABC has stopped working"" then shuts me out or it will freeze and I will have to shut my phone off and turn it back on, so can YOU PLEASE FIX THIS APP!!",
"i tried this app at my school.all older kids say it's boring. I see how younger kids might find this game entertaining, but they can't comprehend words like ""contraption"".",
"My 4 year old loves this, but the game is unstable. The trial had no issues, but once I upgraded it for him it will randomly freeze and means I have to force close the app and reopen it many times while he's using it.",
"This should not be listed as free in the play store, as you are asked to pony up $5.99 fairly quickly.",
Great but needs more letters. Got to the letter 'c' and then you have to buy more if you want to continue. Animations are great too. Just blows that you have to pay extra :p,
"I really liked the way the app is designed and makes how interact-able for kids.. Especially the sounds that are made while dragging alphabets to their sources :-) I was able to successfully purchase,  plz add more words. Thanks.",
"My mom Loves this game, becuz its good for her students & my 1st  grader sister & my 4yr old brother too",
"My kids love this app, but the audio disappears with certain words, like kind and juggle. We have to exit out of the app and re-start to get the audio to play. Please put more resources into the full version for Android.",
My daughter loves this but it freezes up and stops working. I can get back to the home page but the game doesn't load properly. I don't know how to fix this problem.,
My daughter has loved this game for over a year. Its almost like a puzzle but helps children recognize the letters and learn the sounds in fun ways.,
"Our little guy has picked up so many words from this app. Great art and animations, fantastic narration and sounds. This app is a true gem amongst a sea of garbage toddler apps. Highly recommended. Very, very well done!",
My 5 year old granddaughter loves this game. It's fun to play without her even realizing she's learning at the same time.,
My daughter has struggled with learning her letters after 1 day with this game she finally gets it! Thank you for making this app but would love more words please. I bought the full version but she wants more.,
This game has been played twice and crashed both times. The first time I had to hard reboot the phone. Not good :-(,
"They both love it and are excited to share or ask about the new words they learn. And it has awesome graphics is what I like, as well.",
"Like many have said, great content but when purchased additional words they cannot be accessed by the restricted use profile of my daughter, who it was bought for. Please get this sorted asap because otherwise why bother?      UPDATE ADDITIONAL WORDS NOW AVAILABLE IN RESTRICTED ACCESS PROFILE. RESULT. FIVE STARS THOROUGHLY DESERVED",
Very well animated and fun for kids but would be nice if there was a bit more going on.,
My disabled son loves this but I gotta wonder as well why Apple products are treated better than us Android users...that's a bit arbitrary and discriminative....A reply would be appreciated..,
"My daughter doesn't understand why it's called ""endless"" when in reality it ends fairly quickly.  I have to say I agree with her.  It is an adorable app, but wish there were much more words to keep her vocabulary growing!",
My 4 year old is obsessed with this game. She has learned the sounds each letter makes just from this game and we are on our way to decoding some words in real books.,
This app is educational and something my barley 2 year old can play by herself. I love the extended vocabulary.,
My two year old loves this game. I love that the letters make the phonic sound. It is such an educational game for several levels of education.,
"My 2 year old twins love it! Please make another, maybe for toddlers but this is still amazing. I didn't think my son would be able to match the letter but he did so proud.",
"My two 3-year-olds and their 6-year-old brother love this app!  The monsters are well-animated, the sounds are hilarious, and the words are interesting. All the kids absorb something new whenever they play.  I can hardly believe the complaints about the price.  For the price of a gallon of milk, you can give your kid a ridiculous amount of fun.  The only issue we have with Endless Alphabet is with Android itself, being very easy to hit the navigation buttons with clumsy little fingers, sending them back to the Launcher.  A nice, thick case solved this problem, which you should probably have anyway if you're letting the little one at your phone or tablet.",
"Cute videos, but there is no ""puzzles and games"" that the app falsely advertises. The only activity is to drag letters into place within the word -- maybe a puzzle, maybe a game, but definitely not ""puzzles and games""",
"I am loving this app, my daughter is almost 21 months & is doing it by herself now. I just have the free version, but was planning to purchase, I was thinking it was $2.99 but went to purchase & it says $4.99 :/ did it just go up? Also, if I have it installed on multiple devices, if I purchase on one will it unlock on the other devices too?",
Please put out endless numbers and endless reader my child has learn so much from this app.,
Its not endless exactly but the animations and sound on this game are great both my boys love it (2 and 4 years old) .,
I got it for my 4 year old boy who chooses to play this over lego apps. (And he LOVES lego everything),
"Galaxy Note 2. Paid for version. Crashes a fair bit, but it does entertain him. I hope he's learning something. The definition of timid always makes him jump!",
"Awesome app! Super cheap for the full version! My 3 year old LOVES her Endless Words! I couldn't be more happy, if you have an issue with the purchased installation delete app then reinstall! I've never ran into a bug. ♡♡♡",
Add more word that easy and suitable for toodles to understand. Screen lock needed to prevent kids exit the app. Also keep the screen active to prevent device auto lock,
"My 5 year old with sensory processing disorder LOVES this. His vocabulary, recognition, and spelling is increasing. Very fun and engaging.",
"My son loves this game, he's 2. I like that the are big words and gives definition. Only problem there is no exit and app forces close every time. Other than that, great app",
"I LOVE all the apps they make. My four year old is an ""on the move"" child but will sit still and learn with this app.",
"I admit I may have jumped the gun, but he is getting exposed to a large vocabulary and the game is simple enough to keep him occupied for a good 10 minutes at a time. Invaluable to me. Ha! Good app!",
My 2 year old loves it. 52 words is plenty as the main game is the noises/animation the letters make (C is biting my finger daddy! ).  And yes they start to repeat the sounds of the letters too.,
I downloaded the free version for my nephew.  Only had about 10 free. He loved it so I bought the rest. He is 2 and half and loves it. He plays when we go on long road trips. Keeps him busy and it's educational.  Win win in my book.,
"My (almost) 2 year old granddaughter loves puzzles so this was an instant hit, the sounds are icing on the cake! Great job designing this, keep up the great work.",
"Battery hog with no ability for the user to adjust update or any kind of settings.   Nice app,  but drained 10% of my battery in one day",
I love this app. Its fun..but not too obnoxious. Its has just enough silliness to keep the kiddos attention and trick them into learning :).,
"My 3 year old loves this app, but only 7 words are available in the free version. The rest have to be purchased.",
"My son loves this app, and it's actually helped him with a speech problem he deals with.",
I have purchased the entire endless collection for my children- I do not normally ever purchase apps. These apps are stellar. Highly recommend.,
"Great character design and animation! Some smaller words to get started with would be great, but the lad has gotten the hang of it pretty quick.",
"Teaches letter sounds, letters and definitions of words in a fun way. My 3 year old likes it a lot.",
This is one of the best educational apps we have encountered. We would love to see Originator's other apps come to Android!,
"We absolutely love it. My daughter knows all her letters, and sounds because of this App it is magical!",
"My son loves this game.  He loves monsters & is learnig fast, he is only going to be 2 this Nov",
"I would love this app, as my three year old made the leap from only knowing individual letters to knowing their sounds and piecing together simple words within about a day of using it the first time, but it's buggy on my S4 which is very frustrating.",
Both our boys really like this app on the Apple products. Don't understand why they get all words and android has to pay. Glad we still have the ipad. Need to consider changing the difference!,
"But it is very deceiving. At least put the word trial beside it. Other than that, it is very fun. My sister's 3 year old loved it.",
This is a very well built game. Fun for my 3 year old and me too. I bought all the letters for 5 dollars and it was definitely worth it.,
"Thank you, my kid truly enjoy the game. Its fun and entertaining.",
I saw this on someone elses tablet and thought my son would love it. Sure enough it is a hit,
"My 2 yr old son loves this ap,p and has learned larger words than he otherwise may not have been exposed to. His phonetics have been well intalled by playing this.",
My 2 1/2 year old loves this. I have 6 kids and it's hard to work with him on his letters alone. With this app and about a week he can recognize almost all the letters and sounds. Best app I ever purchased for any of my kids. Knowing how this worked I would have paid 10$ and smiled.,
"I would love to use this app with my daughter and in the school I work in, but can't due to some of the sounds and words being too different for UK use.",
"Some of the letters are making inaccurate sounds. No sound should have the ""uh"" sound with it.",
I bought this for our 2 year old son and he never wants to come off. He is learning lots from this app. Well worth to buy the full version,
"Why would you have a pop-up come up asking for a rating for a game where kids learning to read would be using it. All it does is ""break it"" from the kids perspective and I have to keep reseting it.",
My toddler loves this app. She learned quickly how to drag the letters & likes the monsters & animations,
I luv to see my girls learn from  this. They can get on my celll all they want for endless words,
My 2 year old now pronounces sounds out letters...everywhere. fun and keeps her entertained for a bit,
I purchased this app for my 3 year old and he loves it. Thank you for fixing things for me.,
"My 4 yo daughter enjoys playing this game but it is not compatible with all our devices. It is currently only compatible with our mobiles, which makes it hard when I want use my phone and my daughter cannot play this on our tablet.",
My 1.5 year old daughter is memorized by this game.  Unfortunately it locks up and suddenly closes frequently on my Samsung s4,
My 5yo and 1yo both love playing with this and several other originator apps. A deal price to buy them all as a package would have been pretty sweet. :),
"I love this app and my son does also, but its been freezing alot and doesnt start up again right away. I even bought the whole version not just the free. Im so disappointed.",
"Even though you have to pay to get more lessons, I still think this is a great learning tool.",
If something says its free it should actually be free,
My granddaughter loves this app.. but could you please put out more for android,
"Both my son and I love this app, but I fail to understand why iPhones get more words but Android doesn't!?   They also got the Reader app MUCH sooner than we did. Do you feel that our kids are less important than those of parents who is iPhones?",
Our little one (~ 18 mo) went from barely talking to pointing out letters everywhere. He loves it.,
My son loves it. He's not even 2 and can makes most words,
"Love the app, keeps my 2 year old engaged & learning.  Only problem is it has a tendency to freeze and not allow him to use certain letters or go to Home",
Have this on iPad for a year.  So glad it's finally on my Android phone and tablet.  Cant wait for the other Originator apps to port to Android.,
This app is great. How long before we see more of your apps on Android?  I  getting some crashing and hanging sometimes on my Nexus 5 and my wife's Nexus 4.,
"Sometimes it freezes but other than that it's super cute, and definitely so worth the cash. My daughter was naming letters and telling me theirs sounds before she was 3!",
This app is awesome. My 2 yr old loves it and he's recognizing letters and their sounds because of it. It's totally worth the price for the full version.,
Cutest little letter monsters and animated definitions. $5 purchase is also worth it. I love that the words aren't typical and are a little more advanced.,
My 2 year old loves this game. He started playing it at around 1 and immediately started picking up all the letters. Now he knows all the words and loves the animations. Must download,
My son has been playing this since maybe 1 1/2 and he loves it.  He learned his letters quickly and loves giggling at the animations.  Great app.,
"He giggles at some of the character animations and loves the sounds. He mimics his favorite sounds when he touches a letter he really likes. Great value, he hasn't made it though all the words yet but would buy even more if another set gets released.",
My toddlers love it and I love the fact that out gives you the phonetical sound off each letter in a fun way.  Unfortunately it is ALWAYS crashing my galaxy S3. ALWAYS.,
"Soothing background music, sounds out the letters, and adorable animations to celebrate once you spell the words. Great game for toddlers!",
My 20 month old little boy loves this and endless reader. He know some letters and the sounds they make after only using it for a month. He even recognizes some words. Love it!,
Cant understand why my brother-in-laws ipad gets frequent word updates but havent seen a single new one on my Android tablet in two months. Id give it five stars if it got the same treatment as Apple,
My 3 yr old loves this app. He's articulating letter sounds more clearly and loves how words are defined. Very appealing abc game for toddlers:),
It crashes after a few minutes.  My 3 year old loves it but gets really frustrated when it crashes over and over!,
This is a great app for the Nexus 7 tablet but I hope we see an update soon to get the next version similar to iOS.,
"This app should be called endless crashes. It crashes within a minute of starting the app on my nexus 5, every time without fail. I have this app on my iPhone and it works great on that platform.",
My 18 month old loves this. He repeats the words and sounds of the letters. Laughs at the animations. Shining example of entertainment and education wrapped into one.,
"Have three boys 7, 4 and 2. They all love this app and have already recommended It to all their friends mums.",
"This game has ended many temper tantrums. My daughter loves it, and it's not too annoying for the adult. Thanks!",
"I love this app because we limit our child's use and exposure to electronics, even though my two year old can work electronics better than I can, so this app is beneficial to everyone. He knew his alphabet at 1, despite not saying much else than his ABC'S.",
"Great bright graphics,  sounds, stimulation and word choices. I loved that the animals act out the word also. Great great app!",
I love th is app my one year old knows his entire abc thanks to this app. I wish they would have the endless reader and endless number on android too.,
"I love love love this app! my almost two year old is already making letter sounds because of it, and the words are ones I never would have thought to teach her. great job!",
"Worked great till I forked over the $5 for the games. Now, it just Endless Crashing.",
My son is 28 mths and he loves it. Just wondering why it is free for apple version and we need to pay in android version even its worthy to purchase it.,
Great game for little ones.  My baby has played this game since the age of 18 months and learned well. Love the sounds of the letters.,
"My 2-year old son loves this game, but there is only English version which is disappointing",
This app is a lot of fun for my daughter and I really like the words she is introduced to by using it.,
"My two year old loves this game, but I'm thoroughly disappointed that there are so few words.",
The animation is great and the explanation is always spot on. I wish you would put the endless reader and endless number on google play my son enjoys those twice as much.,
"Simple, creative and educational. Helping my son to learn his letters and introduce him to the concept of words.",
Easy enough for my two year old to figure out but fun enough that my nine year old watches over her shoulder.,
"Fun app, however I wish there was an option to use lowercase letters instead of all uppercase letters. 95% of all written language is lowercase letters, makes sense to teach those first.",
"My 3/4 year old enjoys the game,  I do wish the words were a bit easier for pre reading.  But it is creative and fun.",
"When my baby girl was just two years old, I showed her this game on my phone. She learned it herself without any instructions.  The game opens with a word starting with A, some cartoon characters come and scatter the letters all around. When she touches a letter, it pronounces its phonetic sound and starts dancing. She gets interested and drags it a little. The sound and dance continues. She drops it on a wrong place. It makes a sad cry and falls down. She tries again and again. When she puts the letter in its right place in the original word, it pronounces its name and a cheerful sound and animation plays. She gets the point. After she assembles the whole word, an animation after lots of cheers explains the meaning of the word.  Fast forward a week. She has tried assembling all the 7 words that are available in the free version of the game. Although, other words are locked, she has essentially encountered all the alphabets.   The developers of the game had made the game to teach children how to spell a word and what it means. My daughter used it to learn all the alphabets without any external instructions.",
I'm  very unhappy  about it. Purchased  it and did not even last long.,
I really want to like this app but every five minutes it freezes. Sometimes it freezes when I first start I up. I paid for it and I can't use it.,
"My son loves this game. It really is fantastic, but I'd love to see more words added to the library. I'd even consider paying for more words.",
My 1 year old really loves this app and can actually already associate some sounds with some letters. I only wish they added more words or another set of words on a package of some sort.,
My daughter loves the game and its really helped her with letter identification.  Well worth the money. Its bright and cute and fun.,
Definitely worth the $2.99 to purchase the full game. My son loves it! My only complaint is that it freezes and shuts down quite a bit.,
Children learn to recognize letters and more importantly the sound each makes.  All kids memorize the alphabet song but this teaches sounds and recognition that is imperative for reading.,
My 3 year old is learning a lot from this and he is now caught up to his 4 year old brother.,
My 1 and a half year old loves the home button more than anything no matter what app is on. Therefore he ends up closing this app before even knowing what to do on it. Maybe a password to leave the app could solve this.,
Would give 5 stars if I did not have to keep restarting it.,
"I  just  love  this  app, it has been  helping  my  son  to develop  new   words  in the must fun way!",
"I bought the rest of the alphabet couple months ago and now we just have A,B,C, and it says to buy the rest, why should i buy the rest again when i already paid for it once already😕",
My son is 2 we ran into this app waiting at Verizon and it occupied him for the entire 45 minute wait. Came home and downloaded it on my tablet for him:),
"My daughter loves this app. She also plays Endless Reader on our iOS devices. Although she knows her alphabet and sounds, it is a great way to reinforce this knowledge in a fun, entertaining way.",
One of the kids showed this to me and I just fell in love with it. Not only shows the letters but makes cute sounds and how the word is pronounced.  Adorable!,
Educational and it holds my nieces attention well. Cute graphics and she is breezing through the little exercises very happily.,
My kids really enjoy it and I love how much it helps with letter sounds. But for the prices it seems very limiting to what it offers,
This is my sons favorite app. He has learned how to recognize his letters and to pronounce. Its just a great app.,
"This is a great app but it seems to glitch out every time we use it. Still,  highly recommended.",
"More words were added, it is now worth the money. Keep adding words to earn the full five stars.",
He loves the animation and the sounds. After playing this game he is starting to be able to say letters he sees with out being told what they are first. Will definitely be buying this game to get the rest of the words!,
My daughter loves this app.  Wish the endless reader was available on other devices and not just apple,
Thanks to this game my baby learned just about every letter before the age of two! Now every time he  sees a letter he tells me what it is.,
Worth  every penny I absolutely love this game! My children love it and don't even know they are learning. Wonderful thank you so much will definitely buy more games and word packs!,
And it expands their vocabulary. My 3 year old boy is sounding out words and telling me what letter words begin with.,
My 3 year old son has learned a lot from this. I wish there was more words.,
"Great app! My 5 year old autistic daughter LOVES it, however, I'm very disappointed that it's only COMPLETELY FREE for iPad users. Make entire app free & I'll rate 5 stars.",
Another awesome app by these folks.  We have Endless Reader also and we are very satisfied with how quickly a 16 month old can pick up the game.  She is now 26 months and is still learning and loving this game.  A great investment.,
With how much my child likes this it's worth paying for.,
"I liked the endless reader app better for my three year old, but it's not on Android yet.",
My 4 y/o daughter really likes this app. I even bought the full version for more words.,
Don't understand why it's free on apple market but u have to pay on andriod.,
I like the animations that explain what the words mean. There's 2 ones the spoon goes jump and the one where they lift it together ( cooperate ),
My daughter loves this app. For a 3yr old she has a favorite word. Its probably because of the cute little characters but she loves it and gets beyond excited. I just wish they would have their other apps that they have for apple on android.,
My daughter saw this on her friends ipad and just loved it. Hope you port the other ipad games - really love the art style of your games!,
The music fails to shut off when screen times out. Please update to make music stop when the screen times out to lock screen.,
"Love this app on my mother-in-law ' iPad. Wish this one was identical with the new words and splashes of letters as you tap the screen. Too bad, was excited to find it for android.",
"Geez if you could pay for a smartphone & bill, I'm sure you can afford the full version for your childs benefit. My daughter learned SO MUCH from this app & the graphics are amazing. Please add ""Endless Reader"" to the Play Store!",
"Its jus to short for Android iOS gets all and Android gets A,B and C so that make me not happy and I have no money and Android wants Endless Spanish!",
All three of my children range from 1-8 love this game. So entertaining and fun. Hours of attention grabbing material that helps their reading spelling and cognitive skills,
"I work in special education and my student loves this app! I use it as the students reward, and they complete all their work in order to earn it!",
I absolutely lovr this app. My son is 21 months and loves this app. I love watching him mimic the sounds of the letters.... a must have for toddlers and preschoolers,
Poorly tested shoddy piece of software.  Touch doesn't work on nexus 7.  Absolute garbage.,
"Best app so far for children learning their alphabet, new words, and learning how to read. Plus, i have an android and i got the app for free and my girlfriend who has the iPhone 5s paid 6.99 for it!",
my .bf got this for our kids and they love it!! when my one year old daughter hears this app playing she drops everything and plays this game,
"Don't like apps that promise ""endless"" words then tease you with a few and require you to purchase the app for full functionality. But purchased it anyway, good app. Developer, don't bait and switch, it's dishonest.",
This app is so great for the little ones it's definitely worth the money. And it's great to support a small group of developers.,
Something like this for different word categories like verbs and animals and fruits etc. My 2 year old loves this app!,
"It says it's free, but your kid will be bored in five minutes if you don't spring for the $6 word pack. It comes with about ten words, that's hardly endless.",
"When my 2.5 yr old points to famished and asks for hungry, then you know its a great app! Thank you so much!",
Awesomeness! Completely worth the buy.   Need to make endless numbers amd endless reader available on android! Need to have more words or atleast rotate some.,
My 2 year old loves this app. We have it on the iPad and my phone. Only bad thing is that it's very crashy on Android. I have an HTC One M8. It's also missing a lot of words compared to the iOS version.,
My nearly two years loves this app and it's really helping him learn the alphabet. I also really like the quality of the app and wish there were more such apps in the play store. Please make one related to numbers.,
Love this and so does my toddler. I wish they would make endless reader available on android as well and not just on iPhone.,
My 2.5 years daughter really loves this apps. I made a guest account for her on my tablet. But she can't play the full version of this apps even I'm already pay for the full apps. Please make my daughter guest account can play the full version of this apps. 5 stars if you can do that for her.,
"Works great, my 3 1/2 year old loves it. Id have to agree that there aren't enough words. Different activities would also be a plus. From what I understand, there are other apps, endless numbers, endless reader, etc... Would love to see android versions of these also.",
"Amazing app, well worth the money. I can imagine how much fun the creators had making this. My son loves it and it makes drives a lot easier for him. I just want to see Endless Reader for Android. Let's do this guys! An update with more words would be great too for ABC.",
"Best app for kids, unless you like the whole A is for Apple crap.",
IPrice not bad $4 to unlock all letter. Highly engaging gamplay. Reminds me of combination fosters home for imaginary friends and the puppets. My kids love it can play for hours.,
She is only 2 and has Learned to spell thanks to this app. This app makes learning fun for her.,
They can use the program with ease. They like the repetition and illustrations.,
Great app and in theory would keep kids busy and learning. But it's limited and has only about 50 random words. That's barely 2 per letter of the alphabet.,
My daughter plays this all the time! My only complaint would be I wish it had shorter words for her.,
Both my 3 year old and my 5 year old love it. And they get to learn the alphabet and the sound each letter makes,
My daughter loves this   when it works. Since I have paid for the full version it is constantly crashing making for a very unhappy two year old.  Fix this bug and I would give it five stars.,
this app is not only educational and adorable but my 2yr old loves it and can play it well ! I highly recommend it - you won't regret it.,
It's a well produced app that teaches spelling and word definitions with colorful and whimsical monsters. My daughter absolutely loves it.,
"Kids really like it, although they are not native English speakers. Small issue: they occasionally click on ""Home"" by mistake and exit from game in progress to the menu. There should be alert or something.",
For toddlers to learn phonetics and word assembly. Thank you worth every dollar.,
"Teaches meanings, sounds, and letters (to an extent. Doesnt really say that this is the letter A)Option of more words would be a nice addition. Overall, if your children can identify letters this is a great app for learning to read.",
"This game works great, I have never had any problems! We downloaded the full game and it was very inexpensive. My daughter, age 2, loves this game and it has taught her letters and sounds. I recommend this app for all children.",
Has helped my 2 year old learn letter sounds. You got to try endless reader. He's learning sight words now.,
My 3 year old loves this and he copies the words as he plays. It's good to see that they have recently added more words. An option to turn off the music would be great. Definitely worth it,
My 2 year old love this game. Plays it all the time. She's learning her letters and letter sounds,
"She used to play it often, but I find she gets disinterested, from no new words. Same words, meanings, which can be good, she'll know for later on in life, but more words is also good",
"Fun, easy way to learn spelling, letter recognition, pronunciation, and definitions for toddlers. And all using great vocabulary.",
App store versions are much better. Endless reader and now endless numbers! Daughters Android is basically a backup. Well let's be fair Android apps suck in general.,
"Well done! Easily deserves 5 stars. Beautiful app, high quality throughout.",
My 5 year old daughter and I always have fun. Thank you for this app just what I needed for my daughter. God bless you guy's.,
My 2 and 4 year olds love it. Worth paying the extra £2.95 in app price to unlock all the words.,
My 3 year old started to read because of this app! I am so happy it was free and if it wasnt id def pay for it,
A large download. But we'll worth it for young ones. My 5 & 2 year olds both love it. Highly recommended to purchase the full version.,
Well worth the money. Only gripe is it crashes every now and then.,
"My 3-year-old granddaughtr knows all her letters and can spell a few words, because of this app.",
My daughter is 1 1/2 and every morning she grabs the tablet and puts on this app. She does every word with ease now and knows a lot of the letter sounds. Very helpful with teaching letters.,
A wonderful game to introduce your toddler to the sounds that certain letters make. My grandson loves it and plays it! it has lots of animation and great early education benefits,
No issues. Happy customer. I hope these guys make some more apps for kids.,
Love this app so much and so does my son. Please please please bring out endless reader and numbers on android play store,
My daughter learned her alphabet by the time she was 18 months with this app. It didn't take long for her to catch on. This became a great way to keep her entertained as well as teach her while I'm doing the dishes.,
Haven't seen any additional words since purchasing months ago and now animations have stopped working. OK at best.,
My 3 year old loves this app. She is defiantly leaning to recognise her letters because of it. She is now 4 and still loves it.,
My 1 yr old plays this and is starting to recognize letters! It's amazing! So worth the extra money to buy the whole app,
"So cute! Great little app to learn letter recognition, letter sounds,spelling and the meaning of words. My 3 year loves this!",
My 22 month old loves this game. She knew most of her letters already but now she's learning the sounds and making matches and loves the cute animations. I also really appreciate that the trial version didn't have sneaky ads with links to buy games. Our favorite baby app so far!,
"So awesome. Its great, my daughter's reading has improved greatly. The sounds and animations keep her interested so she never gets bored.",
Wish there were lower case letters but still love the app. My 2 year old is pointing out letters everywhere we go.  I would  LOVE to see lower case so he can recognize those as well.,
Love this app. My 2 yr old loves it  she doesn't want to stop playing it. I just wish there were more words for the letters. Like have an update for more learning words.,
"Excellent. Taught my 2 yr old the letters and their sounds way before her peers, and kept her quiet at key moments of boredom too. Recommended.",
"My 3-year-old has tried almost a hundred apps, and none can compare to this one. Her language skills advanced exponentially overnight. The app is brilliantly executed and teaches letters, phonics, and vocabulary in a way that really engages a young mind. I'm not in the habit of giving out 5-star ratings, but this one deserves it, without a doubt.",
My son and I love this app. Was very interested in the oth r apps that I tried on a friends I pad only to find its only offered for ipad :(. All around great apps!,
"My son loves this app he can play it anywhere, that was an amazing tool helping him learn his letters I recommend it to all our friends.",
"Clever, well designed, nicely put together.",
My son has autism and is considered nonverbal. He LOVES this game. It is great for his learning. The animations are cute as can be. Upon completing a word the letters dance andmy son dances with them! So adorable!!,
My 3 year old loves this - it is good for all ages though!  Beautifully designed,
"My 3yo son loves this app but we need more words already. Update and give it more familiar words as well, some of the words are not used in an everyday language. Kids who are learning to talk and read need words they will use more often. Thanks.",
Great app with good mix of entertainment and learning for kids. I do question some of the words like 'gargantuan' being used with toddlers!  Be great if it had more words added.,
Such a great app. Says letter sounds and allows child to match the letter to its shape. My 2.5 year old loves it!!,
Love how it does both the letter sound and name. Love all the cute creatures.   Wish there was an option for sight words..for two in one learning.  Nix that. Just found out abt. Endless reader!,
"This is a fantastic idea well executed. Just one downside for ABC learners, it is all CAPITALS. Would be good to have some lowercase too.",
This has been an amazing learning tool for my 2 year old. She absolutely loves it! She was instantly better at recognizing letters and sounds. My only request is that there should be an option to turn the music off or at least be able to mix the ratio of music to SFX.,
It would be great if you could make your own words and the did the same thing.,
"Its so easy to use. The kids love it. Its also entertaining.  Wish they had more letters for free.  Overall,  excellent!",
"Love, love, love this app! I love that my daughter (2 1/2) after a mini lesson she thinks playing this is a ""taking a break"" and so proud to say that it helped enforce what I've been teaching her and now she reads!! So worth the price!! Now my question is when is your amazing team going to add more for android?? :)",
My 2 year old picked up on this right away and within a week can do all the words. He loves it and laughs along with the characters!,
"I'd like to see the green home button be a drag-activated button to make it harder to mis-activate. Also, expansion packs would be nice. Thanks!",
It lags but its fantastic good for my little bro ^^ and the words are kinda limited,
Love this app but really wish the others apps were available like endless reader and endless numbers. Any idea when this will happen?,
"This is an excellent app for a child/ toddler & up to probably 12 or older. Great music, highly entertaining well made app. My 2 year old loves this, he laughs at it and thanks in part to this app he's familiar with the letters of the alphabet. Great graphics great music and I love the comedy aspect of the characters. I do request however that you add more words to the fully paid account.",
"My kids love it. It allows my daughter to see the word, spell it, hear the pronunciation and understand it's definition",
"My kids (3-6 years old) love this app, as well as the other endless apps ( numbers and reading). Definitely helps with letter recognition and letter sounds.  Get it!",
My 3yo loves it but it is constantly causing my phone to crash.,
"My kids have access to very few apps.  After trying out the free version for awhile, I purchased the full version for them.  Lots of great words, letter matching and it's well animated.  Worth the price!",
My daughter cannot put this down.  She loves all the noise the letters make. very very cute. Hope there are more updates with more words with the paid version!,
My only thing with this app is that I'd suggest making it to where they have to spell words in order and not sporadically like they can now!,
My daughter loves this game and i love how it pronounces the letters and gives examples of its meaning!,
This sets the Bar in what kids apps should be my child loves it !!!   only complaint Restricted profiles doesn't work with the full version of this great app,
Love this app! I cant believe I get somethng so creative and fun for free. :),
There are less than six words to unscramble. Image my surprise when I found my five year old trying to select the next words and the app prompts her to purchase the full version. Glad I have purchases password protected.,
My 5 yr old granddaughter loves this app. Its her favorite,
"In an restricted account it will not unlock all the words, refund appreciated",
Very creative and entertaining.  My little one loves it. But its not endless or close to it and it needs alot more words!,
"This app is great, my 3 year old could play for hours if I let him.",
When my son was toddler - he loved it because a cool way to learn & I loved it then because he loved it & I LOVE IT NOW Because he DID learn! Thank you!,
I suggest you get the full version my son niece and nephews (ages 2 to 7) all love it!,
"I downloaded this when recommended by another parent.  It's adorable and my two year old loves it, but there are very few words available.  It would have been nice to know this before downloading.",
"It is very engaging, well thought out, and fun! Definitely looking forward to seeing more from the creators of this app. Well done!",
"Great for my 5year old, and she loves it because she gets to play with dads tablet! To find game for her also the animation is great day graphics are wonderful good game definitely plan to purchase.",
"Great app, well made. Just wish they would come out with an update or more apps or something.",
"This game is well thought out. The art is super fun, sound effects are silly, and the vocabulary and definitions are really great for growing minds. Highly recommend the paid version!",
My 2 1/2 yr old daughter absolutely loves this game! It really is a much better quality app than many others I have tried with her. I can tell she is recognizing letters much quicker.,
My 3yr old is entertained AND is learning her letters. Download Endless Reader and Endless Numbers for more fun.,
I was considering buying the app. But it crash to much. Please fix it. Stop working like every 5 min . it is really annoying. Oh and another thing it is not endless .... Limit amount of words. And also $4.99 I think the price does not add up to the limit content.,
Crashes too much!  Please fix my kids love this app.  Thanks,
What a great way for our little beaner to learn.  Well worth the 2.99 for all the words.,
Amazing design of the app. Great job. Need a way to stop or reduce the background music. I could not find a way.,
This is the first app I'm paying for. My two yr old loves it and she is learning a lot!,
This app is awesome! My son started playing this app when he was 15 months. By the time he was 22 months he knew all the alphabets! The only reason I rated this app 4 stars is because all the other endless apps can only be downloaded on Apple products. :-( Please make the android versions for all of them please!!,
"My son is finally learning his alphabet and learning to pronounce letters correctly, partially as a result of this game.",
Worth the full version. My 2 year old is learning so many new words. He also knows the alphabet now and he loves to play this game. No regrets.,
Son pronounces the letters along with it. First app that seems to take hold in that sense.,
Need more words and I thought it had games.... update the words my son has gone through these so many times he doesnt even look at the screen to match the letters  any more,
Not so many words but my son love this game,
"This is an awesome, adorable interactive game for toddlers, but it is not free. You can sample the game with the letters A, B, and C, but have to pay to unlock the rest of the alphabet. I wish that had been made clear in the description.",
My GRANDS LOVE this game! They don't realize how much they are learning!,
My son's speech and letter recognition have improved so much with this game! So sad that Endless Reader is not available on here yet. Please make it available soon!!!,
This game relly help's my little sister out. And she loves it too.,
My 20mth old loves this app and can start each letter and go on to the next all by herself!! She already has a few favorite words!!! Its worth buying the entire version! People complaining about the free version need to loosen up the purse strings and sacrifice a little for their children. If you can afford a phone that is compatible with the free version app you can afford the full version!!! I love this app!!!!,
"Amazing app. Love the graphics and the explanation of the words. My 1.5 yr old puts the letters for ""experiment"" in order in 5 seconds flat. She is really learning her letters. Good job, well worth it.",
"My daughter now 3 really loves this game, she's had it since she was 1!! Really helped improve her vocabulary! But now she really wants to spell the words right and she thinks she is because it moves on to the pictures! I would like to see another level added that helps them spell the words! This would be a great improvement and I wouldn't care if I had to pay for it either!!",
My 2 yo has learned the letters in the alphabet by using the repetition of the letters saying their names and it's even stuck in my head lol.  Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,
"My 2 year old daughter loves this app so much because of the fun interactivity. I love this app because she is building hand-eye coordination, vocabulary and both letter names and sounds. This is a rare find in an entertaining children's app. My one wish is for lowercase letters. Children rarely see entire words written in caps in the real world. I would pay again for a lowercase version.",
Hi great app. Our toddler likes it but it needs lower case letters!!! He only knows upper case now.,
My 20 month old loves this game!! The words are too tough right now but he likes matching the letters by himself and the animations are perfect!,
"My lil one loves dis app..but a sincere request..please put your other apps such as endless reader, endless numbers and bebop blox up on android/google play store..",
With this app I discovered  the hidden talents of my 3 year old!,
"My son adored this app....but it's not free and after the first 7 words we had to pay to unlock the rest. That said, its a brilliant game and the graphics are wonderful. An excellent choice for preschoolers.",
"My 3 year old loves this. In fact, its the first app we've ever bought for her. Note though: I just wish it had lower case letters instead of all caps. But maybe that's just me. Totally expanding her vocabulary!",
First app I have ever paid for (she wanted to play with all the letters- free version only has ABC) She loves it and I love that she's learning!,
This is my 22 month old toddler's favorite app! Definitely worth paying for the full version...I've purchased it twice to put on different devices for him. I wish Endless Reader was available on Android devices as well.,
"My 19 month old loves this app! It's very educational teaches words, sounds, letters etc. It is well worth it to buy the full version.",
i like watching the monsters and listening to there sounds.,
Design is beautiful! The colors are vibrant and the characters are adorable! My 2 year old loves this! Thank you! Would love to see more of your apps for android!,
My daughter loves this app but it desperately needs more words.,
"I like that my son enjoys learning  but he freaks  out when the app crashes after learning two words. It's a free android app; two words is better than none, right?",
"My little brother loves this game ! It teaches 3+ years to spell , Its good & educational! download please !",
My 3 year old just loves this game. Only thing I would say is can the next version have more every day words mixed in otherwise its brilliant!!,
Love this app but cannot figure out how to get the rest of the letter please help.,
Even the free version kept my 4 year old occupied during her screen time. I was able to use the expansion pack as a reward for positive behavior. I just wish that the ABC & 123 versions were also available for android!!,
M mmHg hv honk Nunn/ Zane nnxnnvcd aww we dc n,
My daughter is obsessed to say the least. She is only two and is catching on so well!,
Pressing the Back key should exit the app. It needs to end task by task manager to exit app which is annoying,
I discovered this game more than a year ago and my son is still enjoying it. Fun to play and learn.,
My 26 month old loves it. I would really like the other apps to be android available.,
"I would love to see your other apps, endless reader and bebop blox come to google play store!",
Makes me made when it says FREE and my daughter is playing it and 8 words into it she's done bc it's NOT FREE,
My almost two year old son loves this app. Recommend it to every parent I know.,
"I got all the words during a sale, but even at full price, the game is completely worth it. My daughter who is just shy of 16 months figured out the mechanics of the game after numerous tries. She applauds herself each time she completes a word, and we clap along with her. Among the many apps she has access to, she seems to always return to this one. I look forward to more words and future apps by this developer.",
When the tablet goes into sleep mode the letters glitch! Please fix this!,
She has learned the correct sound of each letter of the alphabet in a very fun way.,
Great game for young kids who like puzzles and learning the alphabet all at once.,
My daughter absolutely loves this app. It's educational and fun. I don't have any problems with this app at all so no complaints!,
I want to purchase but google  not accepting my credit card saying declined. Pls help,
I really like the game and its perfect for my 3yr old. I would like to purchase the full version but would like to know if other words will be added to the list? The app is called endless. Please respond so I can decide whether to just keep the trial or purchase. Thank you,
Please make more apps. Numbers colors animals and their sounds etc.,
$7.40 for a basic kids game. What a joke.,
"My 4 and 3 year old love this app and Endless Reader.  Engaging, yet educational.",
My toddler loves it. It makes learning the letter sounds fun and easy.,
My nieces and nephew love this app! It is an efficient learning tool. I highly appreciate the time and effort you guys put in making this app. If it came with child lock I would rate it 1000000 stars! (If I could... Haha) Thank you.,
But it could use more words. Cute monsters.,
Just bought the full version. My 3 year old loves this app! I must say I do to. It helps him match the letters of the alphabet and sound out the letters and words. Definitely would recommend!,
"This app taught my son so much about letter sounds!  He could tell you what letter almost any word started with at 3!  Bonus points for also being visually appealing, even to adults!",
"My son loves this app! I love how it teaches phonics and matching (and other skills). Like other reviews,  I do wish there were more words! Now hurry and get Endless Reader up for Android please :)",
"Love how this apps teaches preschoolers how to spell bigger words with animation, sounding out letters and definitions",
My son loves this game and is starting to use some of the words and recognize letters! Hes only 26 months and 23 months corrected,
"Just a great app... I enjoy watching my son find and match all the letters and he looks forward to the ""tickle reward"" that he gets after the completion of each word task!",
"It keeps freezing. Besides that great app, my daughter loves it.",
"Dont be cheap to your kids, this is a superb app, super fun, support the developer as they'd done a really great job",
My 3 year old and my 7 year old love this app. its teaching them to read and spell.,
"Love the immediate tech support response to my question. Oh yeah, and the app is FANTASTIC.",
My children loves this app however I would like the sentence app for them as it will help my 4yr old.,
"My 3 year old loves this game, very useful learning tool. Full version worth is worth the money!",
"a highly engaging app for very small children to help with fine motor and letter sounds skills	I started using this with my son at 12 months old and after only 2 months he is making great progress moving the letters by himself and attempting letter sounds. It is so engaging and entertaining for him!",
My sons (2 & 6) love this game and had improved their vocabulary.  I have it on my phone and ipad. I wish they have more words though.,
Support these guys! We need more apps like this on android! Thank you for all your work. This is adorable,
Awesome learning game my daughter loves it! We have the paid version im not sure about the free one.,
My son loves this app! And I love all the detail that went into it. Must buy rest of alphabet.,
Wonderful app...  Our 18 month old is learning her letters and LOVES the fun sounds.,
And he doesn't like many learning games,
Its fun game for my 2yo son. Wish you guys could update more words for him. Thanks.,
"My little guy is less than 2yrs. And he can play this game just fine! And he's learning! The other day at the store he pointed at my shirt that had words on it and started making the sound for the letter he was pointing at. Totally awesome, and did I mention he's less than 2 years old? Totally awesome",
I hope if i downlowd it there are full words even if it is a not a full version.,
My 3.5 year old son loves this game! Well worth the money we paid for the full version. He would play it for hours if I let him!,
My toddler loves it. The opening animation makes her dance!  Please port your other games to Android.,
One of the most well thought- out early reading apps I've seen.,
This game is great for kids trying to learn their letters and teaches kids the meanings of words.  Just an all around great educational game!,
"A work of art, well worth the cost for the full version. Looking forward to your future creations.",
"I can wholeheartedly recommend this app. The original animations motivate and provide context for the acquisition of new vocabulary. The user interface is age appropriate, and the overall quality is of the highest caliber for a device app. My only small tiff is that I wish it forced the learner to spell the words out in correct letter order. I've been so happy with this app that I purchased all the ad ons while also purchasing this developer's other apps including Endless Reader and Endless numbers.",
"Keeps my 2 year old happy. He struggles with the words, but loves the animation!",
This app was awesome.   My kids love it.  But when I updated my OS it stood working.,
"My son has a blast with this cute,  educational app.   Worth paying for.",
This app is amazing. The word packs are so reasonably priced. The kids use this app all day.,
Great Grandson loves this app. I bought him the entire app plus Endless Numbers and Endless Reader. He is learning so much!!! He is 2 and  1/2 years old.,
Perfect for learning. My son loves the animations and he is happy repeating every word,
"This app is outstanding. My almost 2 year old LOVES this. Worth at LEAST three dollars for the full version. More words, please!!",
"This is the first game my 2 yo son has actually played & asked to play again.  Great design..   Teaches... Letter's names, Letter sounds, Hand eye coordination, Spelling, New vocabulary, and more.  By far the best app I have purchased. I can't wait until the developers release another app.",
"My daughter loves this, can't get enough of it, but there are others by you guys that appear to only be iOS. Can they be released for android too perhaps?",
"I was recommend this app by a friend, and I am so happy I downloaded it. My 2 year old daughter loves it.",
our little learned the alphabet by 18 and this app had a lot to do with it. So fun and she loves the animations!,
My daughter love this game. It teaches them the sound of letters and also the meaning of the word.,
It is a good app Because you can drag letters to there spots,
"This was our first endless game, and has become a part of our daily routine!  We love it ! The price is crazy especially when you buy all of the games but our little loves them and they are very enjoyable!",
paid for this app for my son and then got a new device and now it is making me buy it again,
Great app! I use it with children with autism that I work with and they all love it!,
"As a homeschooling mom, I would be willing to pay $10-15 for this app if it had lowercase letters instead. Writing is so much easier when children learn lowercase letters first! !",
My daughter loves it. There needs to be an expansion pack to include other learning opportunities,
Excellent app. My toddler loves it and is learning a lot. Worth the investment for the full app. if you like it too.,
Will buy this app if it provide daily new words. Its okay if daily words don't come with animation. What my kid will achieve with only 55 words?,
Huuu8 i j mm m n n / 'm km n t y uhh I ok I'll 'll lj in BBC bc vhhhhm m,
My son loves this. And so do I he's starting to talk and read.,

There is no exit button! How do I end this game? Now the only choice is to hit the home button,
My 2 year old absolutely loves this app! And he's learning his alphabet & having fun at the same time. Great Job!,
Both my girls fight over the tablet to play this,
Is a lot of fun and the kids have nonstop stop laugh over it,
My son loves this app.  He's already using the words when speaking and in the right context.  He is only five yesrs old. How can you add more words?,
Love the app great for kids but would be better with more words maybe come up with a second one,
"Awesome app! My kids love it! It is a fun way to learn the alphabet, letter sounds, spelling and definitions! Great idea! It is hard to keep my son focused but this does the trick!",
My 3 year old loves playing the game and has quickly learned the letter sounds. It's worth every penny!,

My 2 year old plays this game every day. He has learned so much!!,
My daughter loves this game.  I don't mind letting her play it.,
It only let you play up to the letter c then it make you buy the rest not cool,
"It's great because it teaches my son the words, the letters plus the sounds of the letters. I just wish that for the price of the app it had more words!!! Other than that, it's flawless. Very smooth interface.",
"My son loves this! He's a ""late"" talker, but now knows all these words and uses them in the correct context outside the game. Waiting patiently for more android friendly Originator Apps!",
Helps out with spelling and recognizing letters..my son and I enjoy it!,
What an innovative way to teach letters and phonics! My daughter (and I) both love this app!! Can't wait for more apps from this developer!,
Closes too often. Fun to play,

"Love it! Great app for kids to learn abc. Since we got the app, no new words have been added though...",
My 3 year old loves this educational word game! It's  completely brilliant. I would like to see them add Endless Reader. It's worth the $ to pay for the extra words.,
So much fun.  I never buy apps but I might get the full version for this one,
It need more words to learn. I agree with Lilly grady,
Would have gotten 5 stars if there were more words for each letter,
"My 3 year old says all the  sounds and words, great game.",

My one year old knows half of the alphabet after using this for a month! He loves it!,
"Research shows phonics are better for promoting reading than ABC, i.e. ah, buh, cuh, etc.",
My 2 year old loves this game! It really helped him learn his letters and holds his attention more than any other app I've found. I loved it so much I downloaded the full version of it. Worth every penny! I do hope that Originator Inc. releases their other games for Android too. We aren't an Apple family and I'm a bit disappointed Endless numbers and Reader are only for Apple as they also were highly recommended to me..I'd purchase them too! Any ideas if/when you plan on releasing these for Android users?,
My son loves it! Wish there was more for the play store!,
my 2-year old loves all the endless learning games!,

My kids loved this game.... but it kept freezing up my phone,
"My son loves this app! It holds his attention and is great for calming down before our bedtime routine or to keep him occupied while in a waiting room or restaurant. At 17 months, he knows most of his alphabet (still mixes Q & G and U & V) and I just realized this week knows way more letter sounds than I knew. I feel this app has a lot to do with that. It's also awesome for his fine motor skills and he's gained a lot more control lining up the letters. I'd pay more to have more words or lowercase letters.",
This game is beautiful. My 3 years old son loves it.,
"Really fun, and effective learning game",

Please bring endless reading to android. My two year old has learned to speak with a larger vocabulary than children his age. We find that endless alphabet is still a little advanced; however we are confident in this product to help when he's ready.,
"I have a samsung galaxy kids tablet I share with my 2yr old. This has been my only app I found worth purchasing at all. It is very thoughtfully and creatively designed. Aesthetically perfect. Cute, fun and educational. Nearly ALL other kids apps seem to have been peiced together in a hurry with multiple lite and full verisons of basically the same thing..its ridiculous. I am looking forward to more apps from Originators, inc. Very pleased:)",
"My four year old daughter and I both love this app. Each letter makes its sound as its moved into place, the definition of the word is then read and played out in a scenario that helps her to understand the word. Not to mention that the app updates regularly with new words so that shes not playing the same words over and over again. Its a favorite for sure!",
"I like the overall quality of the program,  but for younger children, the word choices are not the most judicious.   Additionally, there should be a larger word bank.  I feel the above issues are due to both the size of the program and the fact that the creative staff chose words (like ""kazoo"") that were fun and ""creative"" for them without regard for the overall educational benefit for the children. (I taught English for over four decades and have a sense for useful words.) Nonetheless, it is fun and cute.",
My 2 yr old loves it.  I also have the ipad verison which is different.  It's called endless reading which uses sight words.  My 2 yr old prefers that one and my 6 yr does use it for sight words and reading. This is a good app for android but I prefer the reading one app for ipad. Pros: vowel and consonants  pronounciation,
"The little characters are so cute and my son laughs at all the little noises they make.  He's been creating new words out of the letters provided and having a really good time with this app.  The free version has enough to keep him entertained but I would consider buying the full version and I never buy apps. It's that good!  And I like that the words are longer words like artistic and cooperate.  Rather than the usual apple, ball and cat.  Nice job on this app!",
"My 3 year old is addicted to this app. He has started typing the words he learned from this app on the computer and writes them correctly on everything he can. The only negative thing I could say world be that the app needs new words. Like I said, my 3 year old has already memorized all of the words in about two weeks. So new words would make this app get 10 stars!",
"This game is great on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Purchased NEW dual core 16GB tablets with 1GB RAM and running Android 4.2. for my 4 and 5 year olds.  Tried to install, getting message on Play Store that tablet doesn't meet min. requirements.  That makes no sense.  The tablet is running Were's My Water, Temple Run 2, and other games like this with no issue.  My kids are very upset that there new $100 tablets can't run such a simple game.",
One of the best ones.  The Endless Reader came out too. Worth the $3 for the package. Great for special needs.,
"My kid loves the music and animation, and he gets to learn with that too.   Awesome Free Gift for your kids from Google Play, and worth every penny for an Upgrade.",
My son is almost 3 and has a little bit of a speech delay; this app was recommended by his speech therapist and he LOVES it. The graphics are so cute and he has learned so much with this game. I have the purchased version (1.99 I think) and well worth it!,
"I installed this game on my Galaxy tablet, but when we try to play we only get a black screen.  I'm disappointed because I had heard such great things about this app.  I hope I can figure something out!",
Most excellent in that they dont do micro transactions or try to trick your kids into clicking ads. Had a technical issue but customer service was very very fast.,
"My 4 year old nice loves this app. She thinks the letters are ""so silly"" when she touches them. I hope its helping her better identify letters. I like that it has the educational element to it.",
"Teaches a nice selection of words in a way that is visual,  gratifying and fun.	My niece loves it. I love the choice of words and the fun multiple ways that they are learned through visual scenes,  spelling and actions.",
I have a developmentally delayed four year old who is a tactile leaner. This app and endless reader were introduced to us by an applephile and he was learning letters in minutes when before it had taken him days! Please please get endless reader on Android so we can continue to help him grow!,
"Wonderful app, teaching kids the sounds of letters and where they go in a word plus a definition of the word that a kid can understand. With fun graphics, noises and monsters it's great for a kid of any age! Well worth the $ to get the full version.",
My three year old loves this. No ads and good graphics makes me happy. Funny noises makes him happy.,
After playing this game for a while our 1.5 year old pointed to a sign on the street and started making the sounds of the letters on it. Great app!,
Please for the love of children make more games for kids. You do it right without making me want to pull my hair out with bullshit ads. Purchased.,
"Good graphics.  Good sound.  Goofy animations.  Above all, the kid likes it and I think he can learn from it too.",
This app is used in elementary classes to build vocabulary as well as matching letters. The monsters are adorable and help kids learn the letter sounds as well. My daughter can play this app all day.,
"What I like most is how phonetics sound, they are very entertaining and capture the attention of kids and often make them smile, well I admit, including me ☺",
This is a wonderful educational app for kids. My 3 year old gets excited every time he's on this app.,
"You know, when you purchace adroid device and look at the play store content you should be asking question- where those brilliant apps which are on Appstore available for android?? And you get disappointed... I have fully customisable Ferrari in terms of hardware but you have to drive in the remote farm roads.. whats the point?.. (OVER 7000 android devices, no wonder it doesn't work for some..)  And then android sky lits up with a falling star and you are caught by owe! This is one of those apps!!! Get it!",
"My son loves this game, great graphics, interactive and what is important to most Dad's, educational. Awesome customer service too.",
My daughter loves playing with this game. Fun and education.  Is there a way you can randomly select the next word? She loves to start with D and goes through each in order every time. Would love for her to be exposed to different words each time.,
"For some reason, this game's music is super loud on my phone. Fix this, and 5 stars will be yours.  Edit: seems much better after the update.",
"A simple game for my preschooler, he loves the animations and my first grader gets to learn more vocabulary.",
"This is just a good app. I bought it for Google and iTunes, my kids love it. Teaches words with good speech and is fun and easy to use.",
My toddler loves the wiggling letters with the sounds. I love  how well made this app is. Worth the price to get full version. Looking forward to more!,
"My todlers LOVE this app, but it freezes constantly. So after playing for a few minutes I have to restart my phone.",
"Please, please, PLEASE port all your other apps to Android. It will save me buying an ipad.",
"I have bought a couple apps for both my nexus 7 and my moms iPad, this is the only one they my 2 year old consistently loves. Excellent design and fun animations.",
"Easy to use and very educational, my 3 year old god daughter says she likes it. Always asks me to play it :)",
"To have to pay $3 to get past the letter C. You could have offered up some of the words of every letter, and then made users pay to have ALL the words.",
"I would like for there to be 5 or more words for each letter; then it would feel more ""endless"". After 5 - 10 minutes I start hearing the same words. Other than the need for more words, my daughter loves the game!",
Excellent puzzle game and worth the purchase. My son is already starting too make letter sounds after only playing it a few times!,
"Thank you for adding full screen mode with this update, it's exactly what I was hoping for. My kid constantly rests her hand on the bottom of the device and accidentally exits. Not any more! You all rock.",
My 6 year old is just starting to read independently. She loves Endless Alphabet for the sounds of the letters and I love how it introduces her to new words!,
"Very well designed learning tool, which is rare for kid's apps on android. And my daughter loves it!",
"This is a lot of fun. Our daughter LOVES this, we purchased the full version. Worth every penny, hours of fun!	Love this app.. really fun for our kids.",
Not as many words as I'd like to see for the price but it is a great app!,
My 21 month old LOVES this app! We have it for our iPads and Androids.,
"Got this for my three year old after it was recommended by a speech therapist.  Wonderful. Teaches sounds, words, definitions, and demonstrates each word. My other children find it entertaining as well. Hope more words to come soon!",
"Playing for just 20 minutes, my 3 year old girl was able to recognize about 7 letters and their sounds!",
"Toddler loves this app, and the reader that follow s this one is grest to but only avwilwnke for apple store.",
Fantastic at what it does. I only wish it did a few other things.,
"My son loves this app, keeps him entertained for a long time.",
"Wow...this application is worth every penny. My daughter learned letters so well with this app. Developer, please make even more words!! Lowercase letters would be great too.",
It opens  and the just close . Daughter  is heart  broken,
This app is wonderful! My 2 year old knows all his letters and sounds. I have not worked with him on any of this. This app has also helped him comprehend bigger words. Its AMAZING!,
"My 4 yr old can't put this game down, she loves learning new words!",
My two year old is learning his alphabet so fast. It's so cute too.,
"Like a thesaurus for kids with awesome animation used in the visual definition.	Adorable graphics! My kids LOVE this app!",
He likes it and seems to help what more can I ask for..,
But you have to test app for milion devices in a smart way..you can...,
My two-year-old loves this game and is quickly learning all his letters!,
Very entertaining and educational. Works exactly as advertised. No glitches so far.,
Kept my 3 year olds preoccupied for hours,
Best app for my little child to improved his memory and learn more things every moment,
"I love it. My daughter loves it. Great concept & words. But WHY all capital letters?	Terrible for teaching kids to spell.",
My baby lobes this app and it's perfectly made for kids. She's learned a lot with it.,
Best letter app Ive found yet. My son loves it and so do I.,
My little one is in LOVE with this app! (I think it's pretty clever too!),
4 stars because for the price has few words.,
Simply a wonderful app. Please keep on developing this as well as similar apps.,
Super fun way to learn letters and sounds.  My kids love it,
"Great fun and educational game for my son, and now works with restricted profiles!",
My 18 month old and 3 1/2 yr old enjoy this!!,
My great grand daughter plays this game and loves it!,
A cool way for kids to learn new words,
N e thing 4 kids has to be good,
Add Endless Reader to your device as well and your kids will say Thank You!,
My two year-old loves it.,
"Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 10.1. Please fix!",
Great letter and word skill builder.,
My baby loves this app it helps  a lot.,
"Easy to use, very creative, my son loves it",
Though many of the words are still beyond her.,

Entertaining teaches them new things its fabulous my cousin loves it and is addicted to it you should get this app,
I would have given 5 star if there would have been at least 10 alphabet free and the price point was less than 50,
Very good apps for our child,

Really cool app,
"Great game,  best kids alphabet game I have seen",
Absolutely gorgeous app,

Awesome for kids. My daughter loves it,

When will Endless Reader come out for Android?,
Umm why is this app $2.99 of android but free for iPhone??????,
Nice apps for kids,
Good one,
Nice,
Kool  Nice,
Great tool,
Helpful,
Great,
Amazing,
Awesome,
The animation and sounds are very attractive to my 3 year old.  He played it for about 20 minutes and only stopped because I needed the device.  I'll be buying the full version.    Only complaint is the words are rather large for the demographic this app targets.  Some are 4 syllables long.  Far too big of a word for some that is interested in this app.,
"I am always looking for new, fun, educational apps for my 3 and 2 year old and so far this takes the trophy. The $.99 to unlock all of the words is well worth it. My only trouble is getting all of the words to unlock on the restricted account we've set up for our kids on the Nexus 7.",
"it's a very engaging and fun way to learn about phonics. i think that putting the letters together should be controlled in order so that forming of the word sounds make more sense. instead of scrambling it which toddlers tend to do. also i think basic or everyday words should've been used, with progress to a more complicated word. i had this app installed in iphone and android.",
"Had some stability issues on latest kitkat 4.4.2, crashed 2 times in about 15 mins but otherwise ran fine.  My 2 year old loves it, good app to learn letters, soinds , build motor skills.  Would like it if it had a child lock option to prevent accidental home and back clicks.",
"Android is sorely missing professional looking educational games. However, this game is very professionally done. It has great funny videos that the kids will love. Both my 2 & 5 year old children like this game. My toddler gets to learn his letters & work on his fine motor skills moving the letters around. My 5 year old girl learns the meanings of not overly used words and possibly how to spell those words thru osmosis.  I would give this 5 stars if it supported older devices like the xoom.",
I've been searching for an app just like this for my 3 yr old. We've been working on phonics for sometime now but he wasn't able to put the sounds together. Within a short time of playing this game occasionally he is beginning to identify words in the stories we read. It helped to bridge the gap!,
But it doesn't play the short animation after my son finishes the words... I have a Samsung galaxy discovery all the animations of the letters work but it just has the audio when it comes to the animation after :-\ please fix... I would love for my son to see the cute monsters act out the words :-),
"A very well put together package; plenty of charming content to entertain young minds, features charming monster designs. Had some initial problems after upgrading, the game said I didn't have enough free space to download despite having over 5GB free. Had to uninstall/reinstall to get it working, glad I could though. As per other reviewers, it does seem a little prone to the occasional crash.",
I have no clue what people are complaining about. Must be old outdated hardware they're using. My daughter loves this app and it works great. If only there were more high quality kids apps like this on android. A+,
"It took my 2 year old about a week to figure out how to move the letters to the right place.  Now she loves it. She's always asking for her ""game."" It's the only thing that keeps her sitting still. She's started telling me the letter sounds as she's moving the letters and she is so proud when she finishes a word.  Love this game!",
This app opened and played for about 30 seconds before freezing and now it does nothing. Just blank screen when I try to open. The graphics were super cute and it looked so promising. Sad it didn't work. :/,
This is by far the best kids spelling game. The layout and design are incredibly well thought out and designed.  The characters are fun and entertaining.    For those asking about exiting the app: press home.  The menu and back keys are purposely disabled.  Have you ever seen a toddler handle a smart phone?  It's not the most graceful act.  I am so glad the back and menu buttons were disabled.  This way there is no accidental exiting out of the game from toddlers.,
"By far my 18 month old daughters favorite game. Not only is she getting good at placing and saying letters, she loves trying to imitate the sounds they make, and she tries to pronounce the word when she finishes it. Have had it for 2 days and she can already say ""alarm"" perfectly. She's using a restricted profile, so I had to re-install the app after purchasing it to get it to unlock the full version on her profile.",
"I am on my third child. I have a lot of devices that my kids (3-12 YO) have a great amount of influence on. I've installed many dozens of apps that annoy, fail to educate, fail to entertain, etc. All three of my kids love this and the iPad counterpart. This app has a genius way of tying letter sounds to the letter names and continually entertaining my preschooler. I think it's very creative and resourceful. I have a degree in Computer Science and never write reviews of apps because I can think of nothing beyond the ways they fail, or are otherwise hackish. This app is truly exceptional, and I cannot help but respect the thought, creativity, and understanding of their target audience that went into this app. Awesome job!!! I was super happy to hand these guys money. I'm looking forward to other offerings from this company.   Thanks,  Eric Wright",
"My oldest daughter downloaded this game on her Iphone for my 3 and 1 year old. (When it first came out, it was exclusive to Apple). They loved it and actually learn from it. So glad it's available on Verizon now. Through IPhone it's a free app, but I don't mind paying the 3 bucks...So worth it!",
It seems to freeze every 30 minutes or so on my kids Nabi 2 forcing me to switch to daddy mode to stop it. The music keeps on playing but we can't move the letters anymore. Otherwise a nice app.,
"Nice game, but is needlessly blocked from my device that my kids use. Please make compatible with the hp touch pad. Also if seems like a poor iOS port because it often is slow and crashes on my nexus 7 with Android 4.4.",
My daughter age 2 immediately started playing this game. I knew she was smart but this game amazed me with her skill. I would definitely recommend it.,
"Can't get past the launch screen, which is not scaled correctly for my phone. There are no visible buttons to press to advance to the next screen. I was pretty excited to get my 5 year old on this, but no dice.",
"It crashes a lot. My three year-old gets frustrated when the app locks up. Other than that, he seems to really like it. Add more words please!",
Not so useful when there is limited words. Would like to see an option to add your own words in the future or a add on pack of words.,
"I'm so happy i bought this wonderful little game for my 3 year old.! The game not only teaches alphabet identification and vocabulary, the descriptive animation which goes along with each word is so colourful n' funny.! A very refreshing educational app.! Looking forward to more from you....",
"I have a profile set up for my daughter.  Even though I have made the in app purchase, the app remain locked on the profile I have set up.  As such it will only work in the primary profile.  Great app otherwise.",
My kids love this game. It is awesome.  Every parent should buy this for their kids. This app is extremely well made. Very high production values.,
My kids live the animation and the words a lot. I recommend to anyone who wants to teach their kids some new words,
Beautifully designed and my boy loves it but it crashes after being suspended every single time! Would love immersion mode to hide buttons to prevent accidental exits (nexus 7 with kidoz launcher),
It's been great watching my child get better and better with the app. Now he is spelling the words as he completes them. It's entertaining for him to play and us to watch.,
This is an awesome spelling app.  My 4 yr old is cracking up and learning.,
"Great idea. Works well on my S4 but downloaded it on my daughters tablet, and it freezes all the time",
"This is an excellent program. However, the iPad version is much better as it has more interaction, and usually has newer words. This version does not seem to do that but I will give it some time.",
"One of the best educational apps I've seen. The voices teaching the letter sounds, words and definitions are very concise. The animation is lovely, and attention-getting (and keeping!). Plenty of humor. All-around perfect; I honestly can't find a downside.   I can't afford to purchase many apps, so the ones I DO buy HAVE to be worth it. ENDLESS ALPHABET IS! Although I bought it for the 4yr old I babysit (she ADORES THIS GAME!!), I am certain my own 7 & 8 yr olds are going to LOVE it, too. Thanks devs!!",
"I want to install all words. It's not excellent amazing. Pls give me right to download full version.	Amazing.",
Kills the back button - no proper way to exit the app. Not bad for a port but needs more work.,
"Apart from occasional crashes, this game is great. My 2 year old absolutely adores it",
Keeps my kids busy and they are learning at the same time.  I only wish that it had more words.,
"Breaks words down into sounds, spelling, and definitions. Excellently fun for my 6 year old.",
Some letters have more words than others. The app won't close on nexus 7. Other wise it's brilliant.,
One of the best learning apps I have found. Wish I had this for when my older kids were younger. They are teens now but my 3yr old loves this and so do I. This is one app I do not mind her playing non stop. :),
Content is good. Wish we could set the difficulty. Also there is no way to exit the app other than killing the task.,
Great app for children ages 2-6. Great reinforcement of sounds and names of letters. Lots of interesting vocabulary words and neat illustrations.,
Both my my toddler and I just love this app. Very well done app that makes learning very entertaining.,
Hi. Crashed couple of times. Later it was OK. But where is the exit button. Back button is not closing the App after use. Would be better if available. Otherwise cool interactive effective GUI.  Great folks.,
"My 3 year old niece has a great time playing, and she's definitely learning. She especially enjoyed ""A contraption is a funny machine""!",
"This is a fun app and my 5-yr old son loves it!  He is great at math, so I got this to work on his letters/spelling/vocab.  The animations are really good, there is a wide range of words, and it keeps Kiddo entertained and informed.  This is the best educational app I've found.",
"He started using it at the suggestion of his speech therapist and he LOVES it.  He is a sponge for learning and now he knows how to pronounce all of the letters!  I love that they are more unconventional words. I REALLY hope that Endless Reader will be available for Android soon, he is SO ready for it.  I check every day and would be willing to pay for that app!",
Kids love playing this. even on silent! they'll yell out the letters as they put them on the word,
I just got a tablet for our family. This was the first app I DL'D for my son and he Is going to LOVE this! I'm getting apps ready for him for Christmas and this makes the tablet much more kid friendly. Looking for more apps from this dev.,
"Doesn't last more than a couple of mins, and often less than 30 seconds, before crashing. Would like to see this fixed though because it looks promising from the little we saw.",
"Both my kids (2 + 4) love playing this.  I love it because it's super cute and well designed, but the words are unique and therefore somewhat advanced (which is great) ..but still simple and easy to be engaged.  It's really perfect for my 4 year old!  Thank you.",
Finally this wonderful app has come to Android. Keeps my 5 year old grandson engaged for hours. A great learning tool.,
Excellent app! Cute animations do a terrific job teaching great vocab words. Get this!,
"I paid for the full unlock, but wished there were more words, and simpler ones for balance.  I hope that there will be more word packs added in future that can help with simple sentence construction or grammar etc.  Overall, keep up the good work!",
"I just have a free version,  and my daughter loves it. Worth buying it, since kids really learn a lot from it.",
Love this app it is an amazing learning concept one of the few that actually works great and my 7 year old does not get bored she loves the characters I enjoy playing and watching with her continue to add more words please one's they can easily learn like here there etc.,
My son has learned so much from this game. We love it! Specially the sounds the letters make.,
"This is the best game ever.  It teaches the sound of each letter,  words,  meanings. And it does it in such a fun captivating eay",
My son loves this game! It is a very professional and polished piece of software. Will definitely check out this developer more often!,
A next gen app which my kids love to play and learn out of it. Keep adding more contents.,
Bought this for my daughter on her iPad.  So glad to see it ported over to Android!  This is one of her favorite apps and she's learned the alphabet from it!  Just watching her spell complete words is amazing.,
"My son loves this app! It deeply engages his interest while teaching him definitions of common and uncommon words. We love this app! We have gone through all the words. However, shouldn't this app have more than 50 words?? It is called 'Endless Alphabet'",
He likes this app. He enjoys ut wile he plays he has fun so I recommend to anyone have fun.,
"Absolutely wonderful app. Really can't wait for endless reader to come to android. And please, please allow tablet compatibility!!",
So entertaining for my 7 month old daughter. She loves it and tries to mimic the sounds,
"My daughter is almost 2.5 and she LOVES this game.  Definitely help with letter memorization. So simple, colorful, and kid friendly.",
"I am glad they finally put this on Google.  The animations are adorable and educational, and I love that the letters make their phonetic sound when you move them.  This is a nice fun supplement for my 3 year old!",
"My 2y.o LOVES this game but on my Google nexus 5 the ""home"" and ""word"" button get accidentally touch way to often and the game exits. So frustrating. Is there a way to block those buttons ?",
This is a fun interactive well made app that my 2.5 year old loves.  It works well on the Galaxy Tab 3 with no issues.  Paid for the full version and glad I did.  Best spelling/word app I've found yet.,
Monster motion letters and phonics with a simple explanation of each word make this an awesome app for my 3 year old. A lot of fun!,
My kids love this game.  It is silly yet educating.  Fun for all ages.,
It is crashing there is no exit to the game please refund my money back,
My 2 year old loves it and mastered it just in 2 weeks.  I wish they made other apps for android!,
Really fun app for my kids.Easy and fun way for them to learn letter sounds and new words.,
Excited to purchase but Please help fix. Freezes many times and have to reboot. Thank you!,
So happy this is out for Android. The best educational app we have discovered for our 3 year old.,
"This game is fabulous!! My three year old has a blast spelling the words out, and not only is she learning the letters, but she's also using a bigger vocabulary now. I definitely recommend this app, it's precious!!",
My son absolutely loves this app! Its so helpful to his spelling and alphabet skills,
"Possibly the best toddler app ever! My 2 year old and all his friends love it. Great art, no pop ups, awesome animation.",
"My kid has been loving this on the iPad, fantastic that it is now on Android.  Runs great on Nexus X.  Thanks for the great app.  Well except for the fact it is $5 on Android and free on iTunes....",
This app is adorable.  My kids love it. It teaches phonics and gives a definition for each word.,
"Great design. Polished app. My 5 year old has an appetite for this stuff and needs more words. Please consider expansion packs - perhaps themed (sports, school, vacation, etc.).",
I'm so happy this finally came to android. My sister has it on her iPad and my 2yo loves it. Keep them coming!,
This is an excellent game. My 4 yr old loves it. Well worth paying for the full version,
Paid promo price $0.99 that said access all letters. When downloaded n paid I have up to letter C only! Asked me pay $1.24 for other access. What a cheat!,
we are very impressed with this app.my 3 year old son is using it very well.but the word sets for each alphabet is fixed or will it updated regularly?,
"Fun to play and gorgeously designed.  Oh, and my toddler can read the word 'xylophone' now.	This app is kinda close to perfect for my kiddos.   The music,  animations,  words and sounds the letters make have captivated my 2 year old.   I enjoy watching her play as the app is beautifully designed and the animations are all pretty hilarious.  I have a GS4 and the app has never crashed on me... Not sure why others are having that problem.   This app has been a really good experience for us.  Best money I've spent on an app yet.",
It's a great game that really engages kids. :) It sucks you have to pay to unlock all the letters though.,
"My 20 month old loves this app. He is learning matching,  spelling and vocabulary.",
"I go wish there were more games like this and I wish I could give this more stars! For parents, I have a 2 year old and a 6 year old and both took to playing it right away. My older girl learned some new words. My younger girl learned some letters. Both, honestly, had a blast. There are tons of words and the controls are simple enough for my 2 year old to use effectively. It has animations that hold both kids attention. The art work is beautiful and the game play flows really well. Thank you Dev. Well done!",
Amazing way of teaching kids. Please bring the reader to play store as well. Thanks.,
My only wish is that it had more words. Works great on Galaxy 4s.,
Great app. Interactive and stimulating. Keeps kids involved and interested.,
My daughter loves this game. Enough said. I'm upgrading for the full version,
"I love this app, my son learned all his letters and sounds so quick with this app. Well worth the .99 (I bought it when it wasn't on sale though) I want more apps from this developer!! (Note2 and Galaxy Tab)",
"Helps read, spell, recognize letters of the alphabet and broaden vocabulary!",
almost purchase an iPad for the sole purpose of playing this game,
I love this app and so does my 3yr old :) very happy how Do i purchase it though? To unlock all words.,
Brilliant app. My 2 year old can do this already learning from 3 year old sibling.,
shut yar nice app but so big data.,
It has download after 6 hours.,
LOVE IT,
"Wish there where more letter, number and shapes",
"My kids very love to play, thanks for created this for all kids.",
She is 4 and steals my iPod just to play this.  So I downloaded it to my phone.,
My 2 year old simply lobes this game. Well worth the cost,
It really gets my kids for hours,
My son is actually learning the words and alphabet,
It takes too much space in the phone,
Great app my 3 year old is addicted to it,
2 year old loves it and is already learning her alphabet because of it,
My 2 year old loves this and is learning so much from it too,
This is a great app and my 2 year old loves it,
My son is two and loves this game! I've got to say I'm pretty impressed with it as well.,
The kids love this game!  It is beautifully drawn and animated and keeps their interest.,

"They get bored. With the 7 words.  My sister had it on ios and earned words much quicker - they LOVE playing hers.  I've been playing during commercials and such and am still stuck with the same 7 we started with. I get 'earning' them, but this is a little much.",
"I downloaded this app as the trial first to see how it played on my tablet, but unfortunately it freezes alot and crashes. I loved this app on the iOS but needs more work on Android. Its a shame too, because it looks great on a big screen and my son loves this app.",
"Lovely,top notch graphics and animation. Bravo! A definite plus in Google Play,envious of Apple store collection of kid's app. Would have given in 5 Star;if *make more devices compatible for download work well with xperia z tablet,xperia zr;had to download basic apk on PC then install locally *bring Endless Reader to Google Play/Store",
my son loves this one couldn't pull him away from it at the apple store glad they have it for android too :),
I'm unable to press back button to get out of application and the price for full app is pretty steep.,
Excellent game. One of the most polished kid games I've seen for iOS or android. So glad to see it ported over here.,
My toddler loves it and I love hearing him copy words he isn't regularly exposed to.,
"This app is amazing! Teaching letter sounds in a very comical fun way that	Our two yr old is addicted to! Teaches incredible vocabulary words as well",
Best alphabet app for kids I found. The animations and overall design are beautiful amd kida love it too!,
Very educational with tons of fun animations. A must buy for all preschool learners!,
Will not install on my EVO lte,
Where are the lowercase letters? Would give 5 stars if there was option to pick between lower and uppercase letters.,
My 16 month old loves this and I know she'll grow into learning more and more!,
"Really enjoyable, my little girl loves this game.",
SO happy this came to Android!!   Thank you!!!  Why people complain about 4 bucks for such a quality game is beyond me.  Worth. It.,
"Great learning game, so glad there is an android version now!",
By far the best phonics program I've ever seen.,
"A fave of both my preschooler and toddler. Phonics, shape matching, vocabulary, fun!!",
This is really great app! I have this on my phone for my niece and it really helps her!!,
"My kids, 2 and 4, enjoy the sounds, animation, the puzzle challenge. Momma enjoys the phonics and problem-solving. Very engaging.",
I've been waiting and waiting for this app on android:-) the best learning app period.,
I would pay to install this app. My 1 year old son absolutely loves it.,
Get this app. Seriously. Download it. Now.,
Been waiting and checking weekly for this to be available for android!! Hurray!!,
My son loves this learning game,
Great game for young kids.,
my 4 year old loves this app.,

Great learning app for preschoolers!,
Great app for my kids,

Excellent application for kids,
Wonderful,
Excellent for 2yr olds,
Gmail. Com,
Super program!,
"So happy this finally came to android, we all love this app as a family, its hilarious and awesome for learning, cant recommend it enough",
This is the best educational app that is so fun that my kids can't get enough.  I wish real schoolwork could accomplish this...  An endless school?.... ; ),
I have a three year old son who LOVES this app. He has picked up soo many words from it including the definitions!. Easy to play and gives my son tons of enjoyment. Runs fluidly on his Nexus 7.,
I didn't think this game would be any good when I downloaded the trail version. It is actually an amazing game. First a child identifies letters and places them where they go in a word then once they complete a word a cute and funny little video plays to teach the child the meaning of the word. This app has been great for my child and I plan to buy the full set of apps from originator inc.,
"Beautiful graphics and nice voice acting, but the game itself is a vocabulary app, not really a reading or spelling app. The words are quite tricky for really young children. The game element has kids drag letters onto the spaces where letters are already present but grayed out. i.e. the game is super-easy. Also it's quite expensive (£2.49) for the full game (free version is only 3 letters)",
"This is a must-have app. Kids young and old adore it, and are motivated to explore and learn the written word. It is the perfect mix of entertainment and education to fully mesmerize tyrannical toddlers. Thank you developer for such an amazing tool. You have done the world a service and I can't wait to see this app in class rooms, or in AR. Letter monsters roam free!",
"Little one played this on her Nanna's Ipad since she was about 2.  It's humorous, colourful and engaging. A great way to get kids interested in sounds and letters from an early age.  Is incredible for expanding vocabulary and teaching definitions and fantastic for spelling.  Overall fun, educational and fun for adults to take turns with letters to. The letter ""R"" makes the best noise!",
"My 2 year old loves this app! I give it four stars though because if he turns the screen on and off while playing the game it will come back with glitchy, non responsive letters. After restarting the game for him it will work correctly.  I'm using a galaxy s4.",
"My daughter is 18 months old, and this is one of her favorite apps. She has started making the sounds with the monsters when she picks up the letters! I think it's a cute, well made learning app for kids. I wish their other apps were available for android. I'd buy them all!",
"I assumed there would be more levels once a child masters the initial step of filling in letters with the prompting of the screen. The way this app is, it doesn't teach anything except how to match the shape of a letter with another version of itself. Don't waste your money.",
"I downloaded free app and the app would not close out unless I powered down my phone. Then because my 4 yr old daughter thought the app was so fabulous, i bought the app. My phone would not let me make outgoing calls. I had to delete app and I'm out the $4.99 I paid...not impressed.",
"I cannot say enough good things about this company's whole app line. My daughter knew her letters and numbers by 18 months thanks to these apps. The full versions are pricey, but worth every penny.",
I gave it a 3 only because I have had to keep buying and paying more $ each time I download the app on a new device. All other educational apps that you buy packages to unlock certain parts has a login screen so that the customer only has to pay 1 time. I feel that without having a login after paying full price for the packages is very greedy. I will continue to tell other people how greedy this company/developer is until that is fixed.,
"Good app, good animation that keeps my little one interested in the game... Problem with controls being too easy to skip the animation/definition of the word which takes away from the learning, also limited interaction with the game itself... It's just drag letters. Very expensive considering this limitations. Will not purchase full app.",
I really liked the app. Enough to consider purchase. However changed my decision because of following: 1. Huge memory hog 2. No exit button 3. Takes a lot of space (comparatively). I will buy this app if these issues are fixed.,
"I bought this for my 2 year old who loves puzzles and I took a gamble that ended up paying off.  Not only is he saying the letters but also the words.  My 9 year old high functioning autistic son is also benefitting from the vocabulary aspect of this.  Is it possible that you could make something similar for older children with vocabulary words in mind?  I love this app so much and would recommend it to any parent.  Thank you creators, you hit the mark with this one.",
I'm 9 years old and I use to play this game in second grade I just love playing this game because it was just so fun to me i'm just feel like i'm going to cry with joy😂😂😂😂😂,
There's only 7 words in the free version. So needless to say it was short lived.,
"Is one of the many new vocab words my 4y.o. learned via this app.  The combination of adorable graphics with lessons in letter recognition, phonics and vocabulary make this app nearly irresistible. Only complaint is lack of lower case letters.  Otherwise perfect!",
"An interesting app , works like a charm. My sisters loved this app so much. But it's shame that it holds only 50 task , It'll be great if it can hold more activities.",
"Love the game even bought extra letters, keeps crashing though and unable to get sound for the word pronunciation :( removed from phone",
I love this app but it's not really free. It only gives you the first three letters to pay with and then insists you pay to get the rest of the alphabet. Kind of shady.,
Number 1 apps. I ever seen and i recommend it to. Those who has a family like me. Plssss update more words thanks,
So I paid for all the letters for this app.   My son absolutely loves it. I had to restart is galaxy tablet and went to restore the app and now it incompatible with his tablet. Not a happy customer. I installed endless reader perfectly fine but if I want all the words I have to make another purchase.,
It's a great app wonderful I should say my 3 yr old loves it I would love the endless reader but it's only on iPad iPhone can you please make it so we can download on the play store not just on the Apple store  I'm pretty sure other parents would love it too,
"I'd give it a five if the pack doesn't cost much to purchase, but other than that, my two year old loves this app. Thanks and keep up the good work.",
"You get 2 free words then have to pay 8.99 to unlock more. Ridiculous. Has potential, too bad not free.",
Love the animations with the words and letters.  I would love to have mini app included where I can import my kids' sight words and spelling words.,
"Pencil and paper is a much better way to spend time and money with your children. What a rort. There are way better apps to educate your child that are completely free, also with more content. Look around before wasting your money.",
"I put my son on this app when he was approx four... His love for letters and pronunciation grew immensely! As a first grader,  he started reading Calvin & Hobbs! We haven't looked back yet. Do yourself a favor: download ASAP!",
"I bought this thinking it was a cool educational app for my kids, however the moment I paid for the full version of the app, my Samsung GS3 would freeze every time I tried opening the app. I'd give it 5 stars if it actually worked.",
doesnt teach much at all and cost 9$ to get all the words. just trying to help my daughter learn her Abc's and this app is useless,
Only a few words available unless you pay like 9 bucks to unlock the rest. Um no thanks.  I Uninstalled promptly.  Not paying that.,
"The game is simple enough for children younger than 12 months old to enjoy. The execution, art and animation is very high quality.",
A most disappointing app. The idea is a good one BUT children learning words do not do so with upper case letters. You would think that the developer would have done their research properly. I have deleted it.,
"Tricked again! My son was really loving this app until 10 minutes in, he couldnt go any further unkess I paid 4.99 why dont they just tell you its $4.99? I wont install it based on orincipal alone.",
Awesome app for both android and Apple but android doesn't get as many words or any of the other great apps they make. I hope that changes soon. Still a great product.,
My daughter started playing this at age 2 and new her alphabet by sight before entering pre school at 3. Cute fun game that she got hours and hours of fun out of.,
I only put 4 stars cause I need more letters/words so my brother can play. Though other than that nice app. Love it.,
Awesome app for my 19 month old.  He loves it and has learned a lot of letters very quickly.,
"Not free. Gives 2 free words then must pay to unlock the rest. Misleading 
to list as free.",
"It was a decent game but it constantly adds new pics into your phones storage. When I upload my phone it had over 2,000+ pics from this game.",
"My daughter is 3 years old and she loves this game. I also love it, it's fun, well thought out and visually appealing.",
My almost two year old already recognises the shapes so she flys through the words. Brilliant apps from you guys. Haven't found an app that is so educational and very entertaining for her,
I don't appreciate that every single time that I play this it always gets me  really confuesed,
"The apps created by this company aren't functional if all you do is install the free version. Either call it a demo or trial version and have a paid, functional app elsewhere or just charge for the base app. As it is now downloading this app feels like a complete bait and switch.",
Doesn't work on Asus MeMO pad 8. Green screen at open then freezes during game play,
"My son, who is 2 and my 1 yr old love  this game and I love that they learn from it. They don't get much time for screens but with apps like this, I don't mind them getting a couple of mins. A day",
My 3 year loves this game. It really does help him learn to sound out the letters. His favorite part is the noises the letters make and at the end the little story it tells. Worth buying the full version!,
Our 3 year old enjoys this game! It's also humorous to hear the letter sounds as they are dragged onto the words.,
My daughter absolutely loves this game and all of the Endless games. They're so educational and perfect. Bought the full versions of every one of them. X,
Recommended from my friend because her 3yr old loves it. My 3yr old son loves it too! I found him repeating the words and letters. Great great app!!,
"Not free,  only shows abc. Not what I was looking for.  False advertising",
"My 3yr & 5yr old daughter's really enjoy this game. Very nice themes, rich colours and interactive. Very well thought out.",
"Claiming to be free isn't accurate unless you consider $3.99 to get the whole version ""free"" on an Android based tablet. I have a mre complete version on an iPhone that was truly ""free"" and it's a great app.",
Our three/four year old loves it! It has taught him a lot about letter sounds and he loves the animation.  It has helped expand his vocabulary also. Definitely recommended.,
"Good for phonics and entertainment. Free isn't free though, you get only a few words with the free install, then you have to pay for the rest...Absolutley worth it though. My 4 year old LOVES this app. I'm glad we were able to try it before buying it.",
Unable to use in an educational setting as all words are written in capital letters instead of lower case.,
"App doesn't work, keeps crashing. Not only that, my daughter loved this app on her windows PC for 4.99, don't think I'll be paying 8.99 for the same thing that won't even work.",
my toddler knows more than abc and i find it pointless  unlock the app for beyond abc.,
"I have purchased the app and when I tried to use it, it crash down suddenly that we're unable to access its content... Pls fixed it!",
My three year old could play with this for hours! He doesn't realize that his vocabulary has exponentially grown just in a few days with this app. Great tool for learning!,
Wasted 110 mb of dowload to only receive a handful of words.  Then the app asked for $7.  Trickery!,
I spent $11.99 on level 1 and had to reset my sons tablet. Since there is no way to recover the purchase with this app Ive wasted the money. Very questionable practice setting an app up like that.,
My now four year old loves thus app. He started playing since he was two! It helped with learning sounds and visual. I recommend this to every mom and dad I talk to!,
"Absolutely amazing app for students of all ages who struggle with letter recognition, sounds, spelling and context clues! Great ELA app!!!",
Every time!  Mad that I paid for this and it's not working!,
When I get on the second one I don't know what to press what button to press and it won't let me,
My 3 year old and 5 year old love this app it does get pricy with in app purchases. The vocabulary my children have learned from it is well worth the investment,
I LOVE this app! It's one of my 4 year old's favorites and has been for a while! It's cute and fun and helps teach letter sounds and word definitions.,
"My 2yr old boy love d it and me too listening to him repeat.everything and he his learning the letters real fast!!!	Just love it",
Needs an update to fix the crashing. This was an expensive app.,
My kid loves this game. Would be nice to have some simpler words for the younger kids.,
Omgosh this app is THEE best app for toddlers and young children. Definitely helped teach my boys their alphabet.,
"Thanks for this neat app.  My 3yo plays it, and has developed his familiarity with letters and sounds.",
My toddler loves this app.  I like that it gives the definition.   Try Endless Reader and Endless Numbers it goes to 100.,
I like the idea that you made a decision about this topic and a alphabet,
This is a very weak idea. What good are a few dozen long words for learning to read or spell. Any kid ready for this game will exhaust it within a few hours. Endless? Not.,
My 3.5 year old loves this game! He is expanding his vocabulary while learning his letters and the sounds they make. I paid for the full game. It's worth it!!,
This is a great app!!! Watched my son play with it for 5 minutes straight without taking his eyes off the Ipad screen. So Daddy had to download it..,
Teaching my 2 year old her layers and what the sound like!,
"My kids love this, especially my 4 year old son who is Autistic.",
My 20 month old plays this a couple nights a week for about 10 minutes before bedtime stories and she is already telling me the names of letters when I make the sound.  And about half the letters she will tell me their name before tapping and dragging and then makes the sounds with the letters.,
Every kid is gonna love this app! Its fun and they learn.,
Helps her with reading and spelling tremendously.  It is $4.99 for another bundle of words...but I think (for once) this game is well worth it.,
I have two little ones 1 & 3 and they absolutely love this app!,
My daughter LOVES this game. But it wont let us purchase the game. Its not our tablet because we bought a game since then.  Is this avalible to purchase yet?,
The best thing that ever happened to me on this tablet,
Its fun for me but needs more words plus you shouldn't need to pay for more words,
Keeps my hyper active 4 year old calm for hours. Thank you!,
Love this app. I recommended it to all my friends and family. I was so happy I could get with out a I-phone. My babies love it and it's just the free app.,
My 2 year old is learning letters! Amazing app! The only app I've actually paid for!,
My 2yr old loves to play on this app. Heck I like it too,
It's so boring. I thought I would like this game but... It's only for you know... Baby's.,
"I believe this is wonderful, because it's from Disney Originators by the original creators.",
"We have all the endless apps on my almost three year olds section of our tablet. These are phenomenal, educational and incredibly fun! Thanks so much!",
Use to be good but now you can only try 2-3 letters before your locked out. Come on!!!,
My 23 month old makes letter sounds and is really fast at this!  She loves it! Graphics are great!,
"Lots of crashes, but overall pretty great.",
Love this!  Engages my sister.  No glitches on our end.,
"I superly LOVED IT it is good for learning infants,babys and toddlers!♡",
It's so funny and I'm ten,
This game does not let me download ugly game stupid game,
My daughter loves the game and has been learning so much from it.,
Love this app. My wife paid for this app on her iPhone and my son loves it. Downloaded it for my phone just for him.,
"Warning: Letters Are Here To Get You In Problems, Helpers, Scared & More For Else!",
This app was great until I spent the $8.99 to have all the words and now it keeps shutting down every time I open it!! I can't even open one word!  Fix this or refund me!!,
Such an awesome app! Keeps the kids entertained. Lots of fun,
My 2 yo loves all the endless games and has helped him learn his alphabets and numbers! !!,
If you have a good game is number is the best way to do the same thing happy game,
"Excellent app, our kids love it. Support is fast and efficient",
I'm 8 years old my still like this app it's amazing,
Super hilarious videos and sounds to go with learning letters and words!!,
"Made my phone lock up, uninstalled.",
Such a well made app! My oldest son loves this game!,
Love this app. My toddler has so much fun learning 😉,
"We used to love this app. Now it freezes, animation doesn't appear. Waste of money",
Really cool app but DO NOT PURCHASE as soon as you buy it it force closes and doesn't work!!!,
There crazy and good.   I like them so much.,
Great game for learning phonics but I wish I had lower case letters.,
Awsome for kids under 5 to learn their alphabet.,
Awesome game. Super entertaining and educational. No in app pop ups!! 5 stars for that alone!,
My children 4 & 5 love to play this game an have learned so much from it,
I also suggest endless Spanish becuz it is also very helpful and inuitive,
I only get a b and c with a non iphone. Iphones get the whole alphabet,
An awesome app for young kids. Both my 3 and 6 year old kids love it....,
Me and my four year old sister loves it!This game is so cute,
It's sooooooooo good if u go on YouTube the theme song is sooooooooo good memememee,
Very easy to way to learn and recognize the alphabets for childrens and also for parents.,
It's awesome,
This is not a good app.,
love the app.  2yr old loves it.  for 4.99 i wish there were more words though.,
Like it but didn't want to pay for rest of the letters. It's not free.,
But.... wait ur game will saved on ur head,
User totalling unfriendly,
Academy,
Favorite,
My kids love it very well designed,
App really would help ur child to learn basics with Phoenix,
My son uses it more on the iPad but its  the same on the nook,
help  us  with  a  little  bit  more  about  it  and  it  will  take  place  in  my  mind,
The app says free but you have to pay $9 to unlock words!,
You should AT LEAST have 1 WORD to spell for EACH LETTER for a FREE ACCOUNT!,
I have seen vdo on youtube i fibd it useful for my kid,
It is teaching her words she has never heard,
It is the best app but endless reader is better,
It is so cute my little girl loves it,
Thanks you for making the game,
Bought thinking we could family share to the kids tablet but endless just wants more money,
Such a fun and educational app. My 4 year old loves playing and learning the letter sounds.,
Everything originator makes is awesome!!,
My little brother is in love with this app and I love seeing him grow and learn more about his abcs,
my daughter is 1 years old and she loves it and she does try to imitate the sounds that the alphabet make,
As long as the child knows to put the letters in order. :-),
Awesome  my kids are constantly  stealing  my  tablet  to  play  this  app,
Only the sound of letter are not all correct.,
Not very many words.,
Not compatible with my device,
Download Escape Alcatraz Now !,
It sucks it won't even  load and it freeze's stupid,
My son is non verbal and looooves this app! I enjoy seeing the progress thank you for your awesome apps!,
Great app. Engaging and informative and entertaining. One of the few apps I'll gladly pay for. Great work guys!!,
My daughter was able to put words together at 1 years old with this,
Your kids will learn from it and it is very entertaining.,
My son's favorite alphabet game!! Now he knows more letters than before; -),
"You can't teach a child the alphabet if you only give them access to the first 3 letters in the free version....c'mon, it's for kids for Christ sake...get a grip...",
My kid loves it but freezes about 5 minutes in.,
My 18 month old loves it!,
Pay to open more. So not FREE,
My 5 year old says it's super cool.,
"Nice app, kids love it.  But.........2 or 3 words per letter is not endless and not much of a challenge.  And why does this app take 110mb space? I never seen an app using that much HD space.",
I love this game for my kids.,
I want to play this but it will not sucsess on my downloads,
My hubby found this app and our girls love it!!!,
"interactive, Engaging, Fun.",
