Review Text,Category
"My son is a young builder and loves using this app over the books. I do wish however there was a ""wish list"". He loves looking through all the sets and wants so many I can't keep track. Adding to a wishlist would be helpful in app. Also had a bug recently with set 60834. On the sticker sections, showing the parts needed, the 3d rendering of the blocks was messed up, showing a lot of different blocks. Clicking next however let us see the blocks needed. In app feedback would help with this also!",
"I find this app very helpful for when I can't tell what piece I need because there are 2 that look identical in the book. And also I love the 3d option, it helps me see where I need to put the piece. Though, there is one bug that isn't major but does happen after me being on the app for long periods of time. When I'm building a set, randomly the app will crash without explanation. Though this is small, I would like to see it fixed. Overall, amazing.",
"Big fan of the app. Digital instructions are so much easier to use with the zooming and the paging! The latest update moves the paging arrows out of the way of the images too! I do think a couple of things would be great enhancements to the app. 1. Create a table of contents that let's you go directly to the section of the instructions you want or type in a page number. Scrolling through 400+ pages for the Falcon is a bit tedious. 2. The parts list could have more information about what steps the individual parts are included in. I know that seems like it could be A LOT but I've been doing some repairs on my Falcon after a move and it would be good to see at a glance where a particular loose part would have come from. 3. Bookmarks. Again, helpful in rebuilding/repairing. Anyway, other than that I'm really loving this app!!",
"I just discovered this app can track my collection. I added all the sets I could remember, and that were in the app. I hit 175 sets and over 110k bricks. I.. may have a problem. I can't wait for future updates to continue adding older set support! Only negatives are that it is not easy to bulk add things, or add multiple copies of a set. But that is minor compared to it's primary use.",
"I wish I knew about this app sooner. Although I will always want a paper manual with each set, I'll likely use this app going forward. The app does a a great job of showing the step-by-step instructions for the build and allow you to adjust the orientation and magnification to see additional details you might not see in the manual from the box. It's very helpful in showing the child progress of the build and to give them an idea of what is next without jumping forward or losing place. One suggestion is to allow all screens in the app to go to landscape mode. Since the app is likely used for a tablet, it's just present better if there was a consistent view. It does switch over once you go to build mode though. I also think it's a bit unfair for others to provide a lower score given that the older sets may not be in here. You can tell a lot of time and effort is put into the database to pull this together. There's not really much to complain about here since this is a free app.",
"This is a great app to use for both kids and adults who like to keep track of all the sets they have, and what I like most is how it counts up how many bricks and pieces you have altogether, regardless of set or theme. I have noticed that a lot of the older, retired sets are not all there yet, and some of the newer sets from this year are still not in the app's database (I assume it's a slow process). It would also be nice to include polybag sets as well to make the themes more complete.",
"Solid app, very convenient (and eco-friendly) compared to paper instructions. I haven't tried the 3D instructions yet, but they sound like a neat concept that could help less experienced builders have an easier time, or give seasoned builders a fresh experience. I also like that you can add sets you own to a collection, even providing a total piece count of all the sets combined. EDIT: It seems they've added many older sets to the app. The list isn't complete yet, but it's a welcome improvement.",
"This app worked really well, especially how it breaks down every part of the build into individual steps. I like that you have the option of the app or the book (or both). We ended up using both and found that I prefer the app and my daughter prefers the book. Also, she's a special ed teacher and appreciated that there is no reading involved for those who would struggle with written instructions.",
"This app works for its intended use. Being able to rotate to view each step exactly how its meant to go is really nice. My only issue, and its a big one, is the app keeps crashing, constantly. Every 15-20 minutes it will crash and i have to keep reopening and scanning the qr code over n over. Luckily it picks up where i left off. If this gets fixed ill give it 5 stars.",
"The app experience for me has been really smooth and easy to use. I just wish that had a few advanced features. The additional features I would like would be to be able to indicate having multiple copies of a set, to indicate which individual minifigures from the minifigures theme I have since I in no way have a complete box of all the minifigures in any given series, to indicate to me how many of each color and type of lego element I have in my collection, and to choose which sets to analyze.",
The app itself is okay. I think it's just difficult to build something out of Legos step by step from an app. I find it easier to catch mistakes when your can see everything in one booklet. I greatly resent having to install another thing on my phone and spend time with a screen in front of my face (or my kids face) when I just want to build Legos with my kid. It feels intrusive. I'd be happier if the box included a printout.,
"Very fun and interactive! This is a great way to get kids to begin the process of theme related Lego sets. This new format is a great upgrade from the booklets, where you can lose them or they get torn up. Plus, being able to see the parts you're adding in 3D is a lot easier to navigate through the build process. The story keep the kids from getting bored and helps them complete the set because they want to see the end of the story. A great feeling of accomplishment for them!",
"The 3D step-by-step instructions are fabulous! Using this app, my son was able to complete one full build, without me having to point out where the pieces go, for the very first time! 🤗 I have to request one feature... A parts checklist. It is sometimes difficult to KEEP TRACK OF which pieces we've found and which we are still in need of. Hi Jens. I'm talking about an interactive parts checklist that will keep track of which parts I've located and which I still need to find.",
"The app is easy to use, but it's missing a lot of sets including newer ones. Surprising. Edit: To the developer who responded, I could also read the instruction manuals that came with the sets, but that wasn't my point. Why aren't new sets automatically added when they come out? Seems like an oversight that could be easily fixed, especially since the resources are already available on a website.",
"Really liked this app but over time many easy to fix problems wore me down. Certain colors are hard to tell apart (dark gray/black & red/dark red) but I could be color blind? Destroys battery. New pieces in every step should be highlighted, extremely annoying to find where the new piece goes. Stickers for almost every set are numbered wrong. Moving the model around isn't intuitive. It never had the correct most recent builds when I opened it to continue building. I know LEGO can do better!!",
"These instructions are frustrating. It's nice that I can flip over a tile in the parts pane to see what size I need, but it doesn't work for sticks and they don't have the measurement numbers anymore; no advance notice when building multiples; no brick outline unless you zoom way in, but when you do you can't move to another area, just spin where you are until you zoom out; I can't turn off the haptic feedback, and I had to turn my brightness up so high my battery died before I could finish.",
"This app is amazing. My five-year-old used this to build his Lego City Beach ATV with little to no help from me! He was very proud of it. I would like to report a bug with this specific instruction set. When you get to the wheels on both the ATV and the trailer while using the interactive instructions, the app crashes. Not a major problem, but would like the devs to be aware! Still five stars!",
"This is perfect for people who want to keep their physical instructions in pristine condition. Only a few set that I've not found, but not a huge deal considering the size of the sets. That being said, you will be surprised at what small sets they do include. You can also ""heart"" sets that you own or want to find easily. Overall a great app and definitely a must download for any lego enthusiast.",
"The colors on the app are terrible. All the pink and purples look the same. So it's hard to know which block the instructions are referring to. If you don't know the set number, just scrolling through the app will NOT show you all the sets. For example: i had a ""lego friends"" set. Scrolling through all the lego friends instructions did not show me the set. After finding the number on the Amazon app searching the number will find it. A bug in the system. All in all the app needs work.",
I looked for this app because my 3 in 1 set advertised a 4th build that wasn't in the printed instructions. So far it does a good job of providing paperless instructions. But I was expecting more: 1. A wishlist function. Such a missed opportunity and would be incredibly easy to implement. 2. I thought the reason behind creating a collection would be to make an inventory of all your pieces. So that when you find instructions for a build you could pull your list and see if you can build it.,
"I've found this app great for keeping track of my sets and helping me when my instructions are unclear or have gone missing, however one thing I found disappointing is that there's not a 'save for later/wishlist/like' type feature. I've ended up making 2 accounts, one for owed sets and one for sets I want to look at getting as I use it when I'm going to evens where legos being sold to keep focused on my desired sets. So I think adding a wish list type feature would be a good improvement overall",
"Easy, quick build, but very fragile as is. Made some minor modifications to create some reinforced points to strengthen the bridge from the left (above gate) to right side.(above window) I also added some depth to the 3 lower walls & patio areas, which also created small rooms.",
"Nice animations but not the most user friendly. Directions take too long to load each step. Edit: the sluggishness was after reinstalling the app, and I'm using a brand new current generation phone, so phone performance is not the issue.",
Handy app; download as brought bulk lego with missing manuals and multiple sets in a bag. Only issue is its not clear when zooming in to view images and colours are misleading on what they are especially with black white dark and light grey pieces or what way stickers go like numberplate aren't shown.,
"love the online model instructions and being able to rotate models just gives that second check to make sure you get the model right, however, with all the animations and effects the app is quite sluggish and chews battery unnecessary. I'd also like to see all the older models put on the platform like the castles and trains sets from the 90s and even further back (hopefully Lego are working towards this).",
"Great app! I know Lego reads these, so I wanted to let them nowhere on the website does it mention this app. I searched for 'Lego QR' because I wanted to register my sets, and found this app so could earn more Insider points. It was easy to use, and worked flawlessly for that purpose. I just had to find the app myself. You just to append step 1 to include something that says to download the app.",
"This is one of the most amazing apps I've ever used, ever. It has a collection of pretty much every major Lego kit with full 3d rendering to show you how to build kits (that the kids have lost the manual for long ago). It's really amazing, especially for Lego owners. Great job Lego for showing how to make an app correctly!",
"this app honestly seems pretty fun for how it works. i dont have many issues with it, but one thing i would honestly like to be able to do is actually move the pieces together as if i'm actually putting it together instead of just being able to zoom and 360° spin everything around",
"I really like being able to see all the sets I have obtained over the years, but there should be a way to say how many copies of each set you have and I have more sets like the classic space theme and Alien conquest that I can't find on the list, so adding more sets would be great. Also I noticed that there was a batman set in the marvel super heroes theme. I also think being able to add what lego books you have, what lego games, and even show what minifigures you have based on your sets.",
"Lacks option to sort sets, the app automatically groups them by theme with the most recently scanned set at the top of the group and the oldest set at the bottom. I would gladly give this app 5 stars if it had the ability to change how sets were sorted.",
"It was working fine, and now it just keeps shutting off half way through things. Getting so frustrating! Looked for an update, and there isn't one - so must be a bug",
Access to older instructions is great. Hope they add 80s sets. Biggest complaint profile avatar choices are only female characters (1 is ambiguous due to a helmet?). Nicknames can only be chosen from preselected options? When I first saw the profile I thought it accidentally logged me in to someone else's account. Just odd.,
"We (my son -12- and I) used the app for the first time the other day, each building a different Speed Champions car! It was an Amazing experience, made the building process super easy and left Zero room for any potential mistakes or confusion! We 100% Recommend using the app and are Very much looking forward to our next builds and also a ""harder"" more complex build with a lot more pieces! 😁👍🏼",
"Awesome! Just being able to see the old alpha team and adventure sets is so cool! I did go into this thinking I'd be able to build the sets on the app much like their newer games, but still. Looking through the catalog makes me smile and remember being a kid!",
"The digital platform is very relevant and engaging for children and the 3D rotations make it so much easier than the flat booklets I grew up with. Also don't need to worry when you misplace the booklet, as all plans are easily accessible. Amazing App!!",
"It's what it is but made horribly. Lego builder serves its purpose by showing off all your sets and how ""rich"" you are. I expected more than just bland scrolling for sets you have, it doesn't even track all the sets that exist, some just remain unknown. I expected there to be features like, connecting with other Lego connoisseurs, showing off your custom-made sets within the app, making instructions for those custom builds. And don't get me started on there shty website. Lego builder just sucks.",
"while it may not have a complete archive of every single lego set ever, it does have the instructions for many of them. a feature that I enjoy is being able to rotate the image, as it allows for a better understanding of how the pieces go together",
"I'm glad that Lego has finally made an official app to download and look at Lego instructions online, the only problem I have is that the collection available isn't complete, like for Bionicle and Hero Factory, with it not having all of the Toa and glatorians along with the original hero's in hero factory being missing with only a select few available for each iteration, some completely gone, like the latest iteration available.",
"I absolutely love this app. building with it is far easier than using paper instructions. The newest sets even have far more intuitive and interactive building instructions, and it's incredible! feels like the future of Lego.",
once I got the kids on board with this app I walked away and they did it themselves. It was so much better for them and me lol. They really enjoyed it instead of the usual getting frustrated by the directions then either getting an adult to do it or not doing it at all. I was told about it by a friend and I really owe them a big thank you because it made my night so much better and will definitely use it from now on.👍👍,
"lego builder helps a lot. you can build solo or team, but I haven't tested the team, so I'm not sure what it will do, but the solo is amazing. You have 3 options. The first one, I think it's like a copy paper. The second 2 3D, the third one, is like a book.",
"I used it with about 5 sets so far - everything works well. 3D view can help sometimes. There can be problems picking up the correct brick size if you have multiple sizes of the same brick - the printed manual provides 1:1 view for that purpose, which is hard to do on smartphone screen. There is also the option to add the manuals to your library, which can be very useful in the future. However, the feature that pushed this app to 5* is the newly added ""team mode"" - it's total family fun!",
"I enjoy the app but can't find all the sets to keep my digital collection up to date. For instance: 40386, 40460, 40524, 30455, 30453, 30498, 30497. Please note that I'm talking about the ""inventory"", not only the instructions. I'm happily aware that all the instructions can be found on the Lego Support portal.",
"Update: uninstalling and reinstalling fixed the issue, however both websites that were suggested by Lego in response to this review don't actually exist when I tried going to them. The instructions won't load, I've tried doing everything that is on the Lego support page to make the app work and it just won't load the instructions.",
"Pointless, won't load instructions now left with a lego set that won't be built. Ruined my autistic sons holiday. All for the sake of saving some cash by avoiding printing instructions like you use to (I have mine from the 80s). Tried on several devices & connections clearly not my end before you try troubleshooting. I'll buy lego with paper instructions in future. What a let down, can't return as bought on a day trip. Why move to a digital platform for a toy that avoids screen time (muppets).",
"Amazing app. I have bought loads of used Legos and this help rebuild the sets. Additionally I don't have to pull out the book I can zoom, see better colors easy to navigate. Best of all you can keep track of your collection",
"Update required me to restart the entire account process... had not used the app in some time because it was useless. Then we purchased a Lego Missions set, which apparently requires the app to assemble - will not make that mistake again. Forcing us to use a pointless app so you don't have to print the instructions does not make the app more useful it means there are things I will not buy.",
"loading take awhile, we've also been kicked out the app while in the middle of a mission. let's be honest it gets frustrating. other than that it works fine.",
My 5 yr.old son and I love this new app it makes building and putting together the LEGO's so much easier!!! No more confusion n if u mess up some how then the app also makes it so much easier to figure out how to fix it!!! Absolutely LOVE it!!!,
"Everything was working great until I made an account and attempted to log in. Spent several hours adding all my sets into it (though not happy that there's no catagory for 3in1 creator sets), so I thought I'd save my progress by signing up for an account. Once I tried to log in, it froze. I closed the app, reopened it, and now can't get past the second splash screen. Several hours down the drain then. Thanks for that!",
great app for helping to build your sets. expecially recently bought or if u have their number. Trying to find what set ur Legos go to is harder. I thought I would be able to create my own building or something on the app and then be walked through how to build it for real or something. Great app though,
"I would rather use traditional instructions because it took way longer than needed, drained half my battery with the app & my son wasn't interested in it. just the finished product.",
"I love the app, but with so many of the sets in my collection missing I may have to use something else to catalog. Why are so many sets that start with 40 not on here? Even ones still available for regular sale like the Disney mini castle.",
"QR Codes Scanning SLOW. Whem the QR scanner is pulled up, and the code centered, I expected it to recognize the code within a second like most QR codes do on flagship level phones. But unfortunately, this one took almost 10 seconds of being centered before the edges of the guide lighted up green. My origiginal review stated that the QR scanner did not work. I only persisted because the app had such an overall high rating. The app is pretty cool otherwise, once you can get the code to scan.",
"CAUTION for ANDROID USERS: Almost impossible to get out of app.. Need to lock phone, reopen and immediately touch the home screen. Otherwise, it is great. UPDATE: STILL DOESN'T PROPERLY ON ANDROID PHONES. LOCKS OUT BOTTOM CONTROL KEYS.",
"Straightforward and useful app, easily download your favorite books. Scroll step by step for alternate directions, even if they are retired. Just made ""Hotrod"" from the Corvette ZR1 set (retired 2019)",
It's so nice to be able to turn the build and zoom in and out to see things that you can't see on a 2D picture andsuper easy to use!,
Love it!!!🥰❤️❤️❤️ It's cool and helpful. It's like having a mini version of the Lego manuals in your phone.,
"Good app, but they need to add the ability to mark multiples of a set. I have several multiples of 3-1 sets so I could make all the builds.",
My 5 year old can handle doing the Creator series sets himself using this app. It saves the spot you stopped at and the 3D models are great for getting it right.,
"No more paper instructions? Really Lego? You're forcing 6 year olds to get on electronics. Horrible, will be getting rid of all Legos. Stupid business decision. Response to dev: forcing children to use electronics to view instructions is irresponsible. Also, if my option is to create an account and give more information to you, then download and print the instructions, I expect the sets to decrease in price. Frankly, we are ditching Legos for Mega blocks.",
"Provides age appropriate directions complete with zoom, tilt & rotate views. I entered my granddaughters year of birth, and she assembled a set above her age range nearly by herself.",
Awesome app to help build the complicated set and keep track of pieces. No need to save the manual/instructions as it's all stored in this app.,
exactly what I was looking for. step by step. piece by piece. like flipping thru the instruction books provided with each set,
"App runs phone battery down rapidly, small screen makes following directions difficult at times. Is there a reason this app is not on windows? I'd rather use my laptop.",
Useful but lacking pdf instructions - it says they're available but I cannot find a way to download them for offline use. I can only seem to get the interactive versions whilst online,
"Awful. Application works like garbage, you can't just take an instruction on how to assemble, but you need to PLAY without playing.",
"Absolutly love this app, such a good way to keep track of your Lego collection. Just wish all the sets were on there and you could add multiples of each set to give you a more accurate count of the pieces In your collection.",
"An environmentally friendly and modern take on the traditional instruction booklet, ensures you will always have access to them. Can't fault it.",
"I like the 3D build instructions option. It gives a fresh new perspective, making it easier to identify the lego bricks. And the short animations are fun to watch. Very well done!",
"The app is great for building new sets and restoring old sets as it provides instructions, but the database is not complete yet. There are some sets that pop up only if you know the set number and type it in the search bar, hopefully they fix it so that all the set images will be listed for those trying to peruse through LEGO History.",
"It's really well done, I can find most of the sets that I'm looking for. I only have two problems; 1). There are quite a few sets that don't appear in the themes areas, and I had to search up the set numbers to find them. 2). I have around 52 sets with numbers that aren't cataloged in the app, I can understand the polybags not being in here, but I was a bit surprised by some sets not bering in here.",
"It is a great app to use when you have your old LEGO sets but lost the instructions. Edit: I am glad that they decided to add in more old sets. There's still a couple of sets missing (where is BrickHeadz Frankenstein and 2015 Star Wars Millennium Falcon Microfighter?) and I wish it had a sorting feature for the sets that you own, like A-Z and Oldest first (also the Theme timelines are crooked) but it's still fine. My advice: search your sets with the search bar. You can find more sets that way",
"Great app for its intended use! I know this is asking for too much and not a lot of people wouldnt take advantage of it, but I wish there was a feature where you could register Pieces from your collection and see what sets you can build out of them so you can see old sets you could rebuilt or ones you never had",
"Good when it works, you have a working phone and the app doesn't crash. As an alternative to paper instructions or even pdf instructions it's nice. When it's the *only* alternative (looking at you ""missions"") it's downright awful. Being totally dependent on a phone app I seriously doubt will even be around in a few years time makes the building experience down the line pretty much non-existent.",
Overall good. Text is too small and can't find any settings to make it larger.,
Just got it today and it's mostly awesome. I got it mostly because at almost 50 I have a few sets with tattered instructions from my youth and now with my son quickly building a collection I thought this would be a great way to catalog all of our stuff and build without having to dig through a pile of instructions. So far I have found 29 sets not in the app as well as a few that I cant verify because there is no pic in the app and lego liked reusing set numbers. Otherwise two thumbs up!,
"Thanks for adding the 3D build for the rest of the Disney characters for set 43221. The 3D animation could be somewhat faster though, it could be a little heavy for some older phones/tablets the way it is now",
Fantastic app and easy to follow instructions for every possible set. I wish this was around when I was a kid but glad it's here now 😊,
Such a brilliant app so easy for a 5 year old and his 40+ Nanna to follow we've had so much fun building the race car would highly recommend 😀,
"This game is awful great.But in my personal opinion,I thought it would be better if you dragged the logo pieces shown on the top left corner and just drag it there and the places that it needs to go will be highlighted in a certain colour because all you'redoing is pressing an arrow to place the pieces and it can get boring.If this change happens,I would love that and I will change my 4 star rating to a 5 STAR rating and this will help me to play this game even more.",
"Simple collection app. Would like to see some of the smaller sets and Lego Store exclusives/giveaways listed. Could also be improved by adding the ability to create a ""Want List"" alongside your collection.",
"great app for building Lego sets. very easy to follow, can zoom, go back, and has a 3D view.",
this makes it so much easier to use the very detailed building instructions for your new purchases 👍👍👍 I've given it a 3 star due to that out 1 out of 4 kits I've purchased had the 3D building tool ... the others are pdf and thats a waste of time .. you may aswell use the manual you get with the kit ... I would of given this app 5 star if they were all 3D .... im also disappointed that the next kit im buying has no 3D tool for it in this app ?and that kit is 250 pounds. To ADMIN we want 3D 👍,
"This app really, really helps with building legos and viewing what you need. After using this app, I'm addicted every time I build a Lego set, I use this to help me with it.",
Helps alot more then the paper Manuels you get with the sets. Lets you visualize where to place what better then paper can because of the 3D models.,
"could do with better performance when scrolling through sets/instructions, and there's some errors and missing sets in the catalog, but still a really good app. Recommended!",
keeps going round and round in circles not getting anywhere with it. unable to get any points registered.,
"Found the app very frustrating to use. Also much harder on my eyes than paper instructions. Can't really afford to print the instructions, so I'm stuck but it's definitely taking away from the experience not adding to it.",
"**new review** so lately I have been having issues with my app not fully loading or freezes up while loading. It also tells me I have no internet even tho I do. Recommendation for the app. I wish I could have my account and then kids sub accounts so I can track the legos my children have too, but be their own thing outside of mine because they aren't old enough to have accounts yet. (No way of getting one for then as they are 6 and 2).",
"Amazing app! I love how you can find pretty much any set you have. My only complaint (so far; I only just downloaded 😀) is that there is lag when you scroll the pages list fast in PDF. Doesn't bother me at all, just noticed. Thank you, LEGO! Update: Also, if you don't press the X button inside of a PDF instruction before you close the app, it won't save your progress when you re-open the PDF.",
The 1:1 scale in the instructions is completely inaccurate. If lego is planning on removing the hard copy instructions from there sets you'd think they would fix the scale or just not include it. Very bummed my 2 in 1 set only has a hard copy for 1 build and only a digital for the other. I build lego to get away from screens now I'm being forced back to them. Not sure of I'll keep building if lego removes hard copy instructions altogether.,
"The app works just fine, but I would like to be able to indicate that I have multiples of some sets. If it's going to tell me how many bricks I have, it would be nice if it accounted for multiple sets. Also, I have come across a couple of sets that aren't in the app. I know poly bag sets are small, but I would like them to be listed in my collection.",
what a useful app. I was building a lego technic hurcán technica and it definitely was better than a inconvenient manual.,
such a amazing app it makes it so easier to buil with lego but I wish we could just dial in the set number to find the box thank you so much for this app,
"I don't even have 1 lego Lol. I found this out of curiosity. I just thought it would be fun to try to see how legos are put together. Seems very interesting that these instructions to me feel very fun to learn a thing or two. I really enjoy watching how it comes together, just like Chords to a piano. I guess i kinda thought a little that it would let me place the pieces virtually by myself? Idk why i thought that.",
"fun set, animal rescue stories are great. i love treeman and the little animal figures that come with the set",
I love that I can view all the different Lego instructions in one app Rather than having to go through all the paper instructions I keep stored. My only critique would be that I wish there was an actual Lego list that told you every lego that should be in the set.,
"better than the instruction book, with the app, you can zoom in on the part you are working on and go from there",
Fun build. My first Speed Champions. Looking forward to my next one.,
"An innovation that is likely to replace the user manual in the push for sustainability. White in some ways superior it might make kids without access to tech, out of the Lego experience. needs a better way to move ahead steps or skip bags.",
My special needs child (11) has just started building the TECHNIC series and he absolutely loves the 42147! Just a touch more difficult than the CREATOR sets we had before but still easy enough for him to do all by himself.,
A good addition to the Lego City Train world. Easy to build with some clever use of bricks for a modern looking station.,
This app is absolutely terrible it is not load correctly and keeps recycling.,
"Great UI, easy to register Insider Points!",
"Just found out about this app and love it! Question though, why not merge this app and the regular Lego app together? I love the ability to add my collection to the app but it would be super beneficial to see my collection while buying new sets on Lego. It would save duplicate purchases from happening.",
How come the one I'm building doesn't even show the instructions I mean really you got to fix this. I am building this for my sister I am like almost done and the baby Yoda is not even finish. Fix this,
This is great. Ever lose the instructions for a set you bought? Ever have the instruction booklet get damaged? Ever want to build a set you don't own but have the pieces for? This app has tons of instructions for building your Lego empire to your maximum imagination potential.,
"I have never built a Lego set faster, easier, or had more fun than with this app.",
I just got the new Lego missions set and i played all the missions they were great.I used this app for instructions and liked it very much.,
Fantastic Lego app! Great for creating lego inventory complete with instructions along with year Lego set was first released.,
"App requires date of birth to ""help keep you safe"" and stores data. The app is laggy unless you have really good wifi connection. Only good point is the wide variety of instructions and the app being free.",
Really easy to use. All your instructions in one place. Brilliant!,
Works great especially with the large complicated sets like the Technic series. Only downside is that it can drain the battery.,
makes the phone hot and drains the battery. Otherwise it's great.,
"It really helped me with the set, because with the extractions in real life I always mess up.",
amazing because I lost my instructions and needed to build it. but when I found this app I could build it now!,
Burns up too much energy from my phone too quickly. My phone gets very warm while running the app. Definitely needs a DARK MODE. Running with a bright white background definitely burns up a lot of energy and makes my phone overheat. EVEN IF THIS IS THE ONLY APP RUNNING!!,
"You know, sure it's kind of annoying sometimes and isn't like the best app ever. But you get access to every single set instruction ever for free. And it's pretty good and easy to use. So like, I'll take it.",
"Seems like a fun idea. Limited sets though. Missing a large opportunity to hit the users like me who collect all of the old stuff. Space, castle, pirate subthemes from 80s/90s",
"This is a 5 ⭐ set, if you can find it. it was retired in 2012 FYI - MAKE SURE IT SHIPS FROM AND TO THE USA - CUSTOMS WILL DAMAGE THE BOX AND CAN HOLD UP SHIPPING 3 TO 6 MONTHS - Just the custom Mini-Figs are worth it's weight in gold 🪙. Highly recommend to any Star Wars Lego Fan",
"I'm sure this app offers a service for most users, however, I must rate it based off my only reason for downloading. No paper instructions come with BrickLink Designer sets. Instead, there is a printout with a QR code for this app. Fine. After installation, the app did not recognize the QR code nor have instructions for the set. Instead of building with the family on this Father's Day, I am waiting for a PDF on a laptop to download. Don't advertise the app when it doesn't have the instructions.",
"Great app, and I have a set idea: LEGO SLIME RANCHER!, can you think about making sets based on this popular video game? that would make me happy. EDIT: you can just modify the Lego head to make the slimes.",
"Lego Builder is Truly a Motivational Educative App for all ages. My niece of 8 year, was so happy when building this wonderful pieces together to create a Greater Crane, which I just felt so happy he could. Keep IT ⌨️🖱️🖥️💻 Up 💪🏽💯 and God Bless You for your support in relaxation and Education. Thanks 🌹",
"Great way to build your sets and not to lose your mind trying to find what step you were on when you need to take a break, sometimes though the sets won't load.",
"A bit laggy, but I overall like the idea and the app. It's also cool how you can connect you're LEGO account to the app and make a collection. Cool app! (Good job LEGO!)",
"When it works (first 3 to 6 months) - 5 star's. It's a really good idea and simple for children to use, an our daughter enjoyed it. Since it's been playing up, I've uninstalled and reinstalled it (many times now) with no improvement. I've now got to the point of I'm not reinstalling, until the bug's have been fixed. (I know it's not my phone, as everything runs fine).",
The build was real easy and straightforward. The assembly is solid.,
Fantastic app very easy to use and the 3d illustrations are top rate.,
Doen't scan the codes properly. Not useful at all.,
Ok. So It Will Be Patched Soon (Hopefully) But My Lego Builder Keeps Crashing Every Like 3 Minutes (I Have A Samsung Galaxy S5 So That May Be The Problem) But I Hope They Fix It Soon :(,
"It's okay missing some sets, And all the polybags. Doesn't have ironman 3 sets.",
Great app tho the option to prevent screen timing out would be very helpful,
Great app to log sets. 3d instructions are a good idea too.,
There serious bag with app as the videos are not playing. Please fix :(,
the math for each manual is a bit excessive but fun app to use,
so convenient. i do not need to keep all ripped the paper booklets 💜 thank you lego,
"I'm not sure when the team building was added, but it's such an amazing feature. It turns building complex sets into a really fun group activity, dramatically reducing build time. It truly revolutionized the LEGO experience. We're never building without it again. My kids are also very fond of the mission sets.",
really great to build and hear the clicking of the bricks.,
"I wish all sets had the 3D build option. Rotating in 3D and zooming in really helped some less obvious steps. The PDF doesn't move, and also doesn't scale properly when instructions show you the size of Technic pieces. 3D build instructions were always exactly scaled to my phone (Fold 4), so were a good reference. Otherwise, a great companion app for building.",
I love this app. It is a great alternative for the guidance book. You can save your progress when exiting the site.,
"A good app and useful for tracking what kits you have (I love the count of how many lego pieces you own) and instructions available whenever you need them. Some suggestions for improvements. 1. Wish Lists, so we can add kits we would like and maybe even share them with friends and family? 2. Parts ordering, it would be nice if you could see all the parts listed in each kit and order from the app if you require replacements.o",
"Overall a good app. Couple of things that we have found problematic. When using on a Chromebook it doesn't scale to the screen so it shows the view in portrait. Also we have found that not all of our sons sets are available, even though they are fairly new models. So one of his Cars sets is available and one isn't despite being purchased at the same time.",
"When first used i find the build i wanted to work on and i just finished my Lego build i would reccomend this app for people that don't no how to build, also there are no ads too",
I like this app because it helps my 6 year old build his legos all by himself without frustration. Very well detailed,
so fun I love it and so do my children one thing tho make a tab that shows u all the minifigers other then that great 👍,
"pretty good app, would like if you get points for adding lego sets that you've bought.",
Some stets are sadly missing in the library but else is pretty cool!,
"I saw that I'm supposed to be able to use 3D instructions, I opened the Lego set I was building, and the 3D option wasn't there",
It's so helpful when you lose your instructions book and if you a 1-2 builder scale,
"enjoying this one. It gets the old grey matter in gear, great challenge",
"At first, there was an irritating behavior: despite creating a Lego account via the app, it wouldn't remember the last page I was on, which was very frustrating for a 1580-pieces set with over 500 steps since I had to find the last step I was at after every postpone. I was convinced it was a bug. I contacted LEGO customer support via e-mail through their website, and they solved the problem quickly by having me reinstall the app. Now it's working fine, but time will tell if I have to reinstall it again. Now, for the app itself: I like very much that I can zoom in, and also the colors are better than in the paper instruction book. However, for obvious reasons, the ""1:1"" scales shown for some pieces cannot work, so you have to live with that. Also, there is no way to jump quickly to a step or page number other that ""flipping"" through the book, which can be a lot of work if the book is big, even using the quick preview at the bottom. Finally, I find the app is a bit slow in general, even when not inside a book.",
Edit.. I got it work finally Uninstalled reinstalled but I thought you could take pictures of your blocks and that would pick out things you could build or did I see that wrong? It doesn't work. I tried to login about 10 times..nothing you can't take a picture like advertised....nothing. it just doesn't work....,
"Hey, I have multiple vintage Lego sets. System , and non-catagorized sets. I want to be able to. I hope you can fix this. For now I give you guys a 2 star. Sincerely ManagerUsefullTurtle100",
"This app used to be great, but the style change to this new digital style is frustrating. Happy to change this to a 5 star review if there was a way to choose the old book style of instructions",
"It's nice but it's quite annoying to find Lego sets and the new instructions are super annoying when you have to press a button every second, especially when your building a big Lego set.",
"Not a single set I've had has ""3D"" instructions. And these are the most expensive (and I'd think would benefit the most) sets. Better off with the PDFs.",
"I love using this app as a companion app for my Lego collection, such as keeping count of my sets and pieces that I have in total. I would love to have the ability to add multiple of sets, that add to my overall piece count, at the moment it only let's me add one of a set and I have a few double of sets such at the 3 in 1 creator sets. If I can add multiple sets and see my true Lego piece count I'd love this app even more!",
"Would be higher as this ap was great but for some reason since the update, after scanning qr code then go to build instructions, it just stays on the first brick that just flashes yellow continuously, therefore can't use the instructions on the ap.",
"Absolutely great app me and my son love using it to build are legos together but, after the recent update my login doesn't stay logged on, and when I try to log in, it doesn't even bring the window up to allow me to log in again.",
Nice app and a fun way to build. Would be great if it could be made available on Amazon's Fire Tablet store so more kids can have it on their devices instead of having to borrow parents' phones in order to build their sets.,
I enjoy this app for the sets that have an alternative build on them that only has them online but I found it very pleasant that I didn't have to turn the page physically just pushed a next button.,
"This app is great and the only thing I would want it to have, besides more sets and older ones, is the ability to wishlist... Otherwise great app",
"No traditional instructions and no pc instructions on the City Lego sets. Nice job, Lego. Now I lose access to my phone, and my child gets excessive screen time. Two birds, one stone.",
I love the app it calculates the number Of prices and how many sets I have but it can have a feature to increase the number of the same set and some sets instructions are not avalible,
"Unable to earn points after qr scan, no option is present",
"Cool app, the ability to inventory your sets is helpful, particularly for the quick access to the manuals. Total brick count is excellent, as that's always been a rough guess! What'd be great is if more older sets get backfilled (i.e. 80's/90's Pirates 😍). Even if they're too old for digital instructions, it'd be great from an inventory & brick count side of things (6289 is already an example). That'd also help collectors validate which sets they're missing at a glance. Wishlist ability too?",
"I can't login. Why? Update: I contacted customer service and explained, that when I try to login my default Brave browser opens and I enter login information and nothing happens. The technician Victor didn't solved the problem and promised to contact me tomorrow. I thought maybe it's my browser is the problem. I switched default browser to Chrome and the problem was solved. I can now easily login in my account. I changed my rating to 4 stars, because the instructions are low quality images.",
"Great app, really nice since I don't want to rummage through my books to get out the instructions when I take apart a set. Only issue is one of my sets seem to be missing. I can't find 40516 when typing the set name or number. Hope this can be added cause other than that and if any other sets missing it is a five star app!",
"I find that the instructions are a lot easier to use than using the book, it keeps the place where you leave so when you pick it up again you don't have to find the right bit, also I find it really useful to be able to enlarge the pieces, the app is getting better slowly for the amount of lego that is recorded on there, I'm waiting for the older models to be uploaded",
"The App works as is intended, but there are a few quality of life changes I would like to see. First and foremost, a way to turn off the vibration - it's infuriating, annoying, and I hate it. If I didn't have to use the app to build the Castle in the Forest (as the instructions aren't yet available elsewhere), it would all ready be uninstalled because of this. Second, there's a lot of time spent watching animations between steps. I recognise their value, but I'd love an option to disable them",
"This is the best app I have installed on my phone. I'm quite a Lego collector and I'm in love with this, because of the preservation of old 2000-14 sets like Technic, Star Wars, and old City models. I was really surprised about the discontinued page, it actually is the best part of the app for me, I could stay HOURS just passing one by one of the sets and thinking about the memories.. to finish, the only problem with the app is that sliding is slow, would also LOVE to see more System sets! ❤",
I recently noticed they updated their Bionicle inventory and added G1 figures! I also noticed that they are making Bionicle like marvel figures and that's cool but what we really want is for Lego to bring Bionicle back as a full I.P.,
"Makes me download another app to build a Mario kit. Downloaded this app as it's what instructed in the (lack of) paper instructions. 1 star, useless to me.",
"Awesome idea but frustrating I cast this on the big screen and we're ready to go. Or if it's a quick build then we will just use it on my phone. The problem is that it does not save progress; be it if the phone rings, if I need to go look at another tab/app or if I pause for the day. It would also be good to integrate the animated shorts from the website.",
takes a long time to build with this program instead of paper instructions,
Easy to use when lego instructions aren't included in the lego sets.,
"Great app but could be improved. It would be great if the tiny sets from magazine issues were added. Also a separate link for the parts so it's easier to tick them off. It would also be amazing, if possible, to simplify printing so they come out like the booklets, my 5yo prefers a hard copy. I spent ages trying to get them back to back on my printer and eventually gave up and printed them individually. I also wish it was available on more platforms, ie kids kindle, to keep my phone safe.",
So much better than the book alone. everything was explained perfect and super easy to understand with any LEGO set,
so confusing. won't let u go backwards incase you missed a step. half the time u do little bits and they dont show you how to build the entire thing. so stupid,
"follows perfectly with books! great way to co-build with someone! daughter and I love it. one uses book, one uses app!",
"Decent enough in principle, with good and uncluttered UI. It can be a lot more comfortable propping up a tablet which is running this app., than making enough room for the printed manual. However, this app. soon begins to lag for no apparent reason, and has crashed on me more than once during a single build. When it does, your progress is not saved, so you have to hope you remembered where you got up to on reloading.",
"Great app! One of the pros is having the instuctions on a upright monitor (like on desktop, laptop, or something with a stand for iPad and etc.), so not leaning over a instruction booklet. Paper intruction books included with sets are still a must, with that said not everyone can access downloadable apps or have devices, but if you like Lego this is a must have app! Access to every set of intructions in PDF form for every Lego set you can think of is incredible. App works well too no complaints.",
"Yes, it's easy to use, but it kind of sucks at the same time! For example, in the Lego Mario app, you can search for a set by its number... you can't do that in this app. The app works perfectly, yes, but it's kind of annoying to not find the set you're looking for by it's set number!",
"Doesn't have all the sets available I wish we're. Would like to see part listings to order additional pieces, but some aren't listed unfortunately. Would like to be able to scan through pages by clicking and dragging the pages, but not very efficient. It's a great idea. Needs a few tweaks for a much more efficient app.",
Good but far from complete. even with somewhat recent sets.,
"kit is really well built, instruction are a little difficult to understand but can be done if you take your time and look. Recommend that you count all your parts before starting. I got to the last two assembly instruction and two parts are missing. Not a big deal but not a complete kit either all and all 9 out of 10",
it helps me build a little bit better since I can turn the angle,
"Ok app. Have great access to pretty much any and all kit instructions you would want. But the app keeps crashing, and you cant actually make it through a full set of instructions. Every time it crashes, you have to start over. Then it crashes again, and you end up in a never ending cycle that prevents you from doing anything.",
Just fricken awesome. some hard to find sets haven't been loaded and of yet but I'm sure they will in future. sets like 40565 and 40478.,
"The app just crashes or when going back pages the reader defaults to the beginning, a real pain when building a big kit and it goes back to page one when you were on 400. Then you cannot easily go to the page you were in before it skipped to the beginning. Not impressed at all.",
love it! so much easier than the booklets. makes it more fun. the colours are brighter so you know which ones to use if your shaded colour blind like me. you can 360° the 3d images to see exactly where each piece goes. you get an applause when you complete a hard part of the build 🤣. only grudge is that the app uses alot of your battery (best to charge while using it). wish this was available years ago! Well done lego for this 👏🏻 👍🏻,
This app is amazing for keeping count of your sets and letting people use instructions for sets no matter if they have them or not! I have I think 90+ sets and I would like it if there was a feature that let's you add multiple of a set to your collection and it would say x2 or x3 in the corner of the set in the collection. Like if you bought multiple Minifigure packs you could keep count of how much.,
"Extremely good app. Has detailed 3D and more instructions on nearly every set. Only thing is that there isnt enough options on the lego sets. Lego sets from the 1990s and before should be on there in some kind of way. Clean interface, minor reason.",
Great. Makes it very easy to find and use. Kids love it. What would be cooler if there was a community part where people could create and share. Maybe allow more people to create an account (i did not got what i needed). Probably could have people create on the app and then buy those pieces. Then ship it out to them. The program can create the instructions and then other copys can be sold as well. I wonder how the sorting of the pieces are done...is this a problem. Have you created a...,
"First off, I think this app is great. It's easy to use and very helpful. However, there is a lot of room for improvement. There seems to be a bug where it doesn't save my avatar. It would really be nice if there could be multiple profiles as myself and my kids would like to keep our sets separate. Also, as a collector it would be really great to add a set wishlist as well since it's so easy to look through all the sets in one place. Either way though, thank you for giving us this great app!",
"it's fine. I get the objective but it's hard to know, or make out exactly which piece to use. for example when you have a bag of multiple long flat and similar colors, it's hard to make out by the photo on a phone which is the correct piece to be using",
"Sometimes, there are blank screens in the instructions, and it is then confusing.",
"Overall app is perfect. The only thing I am missing are the instructions for polybags or at least an option to add them to my profile. Same for the sets made in 80's, 90's,.. Once instructions will be added, I will be able to have everything at one place.",
"Would rate higher except for two critical flaws. It won't let me add duplicate sets, and the app doesn't have some of my sets to add which defeats the purpose of keeping track of all my sets and total pieces count.",
Perfect to pair with Lego 2k Drive. Especially if you're like me and getting to drive the lego cars I grew up with.,
"It is so convenient to pull up instructions digitally via this app, rather than downloading PDFs. I love it!",
"I used the 3D plans to build set 75332, AT-ST. It made building Lego more enjoyable. I usually tend to jump ahead with the book instructions and miss something at least once. This makes me slow down and actually grab the pieces I need, then build it. I love this app! The colours are easier to pick out than the books as well.",
fantastic my 4year old used the app and put it all together by himself I am so proud,
this set was so much fun for my 8year old son and myself! I highly recommend,
"I'm continually losing my place in the PDF instructions. I've lost my place when the app crashed. Lost it when the screen rotated. Lost it when the tablet was bumped. Lost it just by closing and reopening the app. This is incredibly frustrating, especially on the larger sets. It needs to auto save location as well as provide a fast way to skip ahead. Allow random page access or skip to next bag or even just push and hold page advance. The 3d instructions are neat but only seldomly supported.",
it has nearly every old set and it makes it very easy to find peaces to build retired sets and sets you want that are retired,
"The app is a WINNER! love the 3D building feature, It really Does make the building process So much more fun, Even the pdfs are great, I always had a problem with Pdfs I downloaded from the website not being the best quality, but these are Fantastic. The only downside I can think of is a few sets I own that aren't very old, don't show up, but I'm sure they will be added soon, and Icons is missing. Again, I'm sure it's on it's way, Other than that, I don't have much bad to say, I love the app.",
"Excellent for most sets, some smaller sets are missing, but you can still download their instructions from LEGO through this app.",
"This app is AWESOME!!!!! Finally a way to keep an inventory on my Lego sets. But honestly if I was y'all, I'd change one thing. In the section of the collectible Minifigures, I would list them individually because at this time of writing this review I've just started collecting the DC Minifigures. Other than that I love it.",
"A company so damn rich, yet not rich enough to fix their app's internal issues? you know what pisses me off? Not only are you highly profitable for a toy company, But WHY THE HELL DOES YOUR APP SUFFER A STROKE REGULARLY WHEN ITS COME TO THE ""MISSIONS"" SEGMENT!? fix this! You sell sets that require this app, yet the main function gets immidietly shunt down due to problems!? FIX THIS DAMMIT!",
"My kid likes this app a lot, can you enable it to work on Android TV please",
"amazing app with 0 issues, just wish the 3d builder was available for all sets and not just select ones as its better than the pdf's in my opinion. regardless is a super helpful app (Edit:Also if the vibration could have an option to be shut off that would be nice too. I will say lastly, if this is still relevent, for someone who has gotten sets so far with physical instructions, I have found physical instructions helpful. Please keep these with sets due to that its hard to see on a phone)",
I have 2 sets but only at offline the booklet says that top has a only hat in lighthouse an in online i found a dot so i remove the black plate and i place browen dot and a black plate only is the old booklet messed the cow without grass.,
I'm disappointed this just gives a locked down PDF version of the instructions for the set I bought. For one thing I'd like to be able to download the pdfs. Also I was hoping for something more multimedia like some animation or what about augmented reality?! It seems like very few sets are available in the 3d format. I'd really like to see a huge catalog here including old classic sets that I still have the pieces for but the instructions are long gone.,
"Not a fan of needing an app over a physical copy of how to assemble my sets. Especially when the digital version randomly fast forwards to a point much farther then you were just at with no indication it did so. It also had been outlining the pieces that were being attached per step, and about halfway through the build that just stopped. Not impressed.",
"it's nice to have an app, but it's very annoying to not have a paper copy of the Lego set you just spent good money on",
"Honestly Legos tech integration saved Lego, loving the 3D building and collection management, I wish I can manually add non-set pieces I have to the collection",
This app is awesome because the quality of the instructions is amazing and the app let's you look at and build retired themes and sets,
Amazing app I recently decided to rebuild all my lego that was broken. The app allowed me to use the manual as mine had seen better days would recommend to any lego builder,
Good and useful if you have the sets available. But needs more extensive library of older sets. Even better if it had all sets made. And some kind of option to quickly jump to the parts section so you dont have to scroll all the way there an loose your place. And a parts checklist would be nice too.,
instructions booklet would be greatly appreciated this whole missions to build is lame,
"Great help, don't even use the manuals anymore",
this app is very easy to use and kid friendly! my boys and I love building together and the app helps make it really fun!,
"Similar to some others, some (a dozen maybe) sets dissapeared from my collection. I added them back in. some stayed, others instant disappear. I added both via search and QR code and they show in my list for about 30 seconds, then my list drops by 5 and the sets evaporate. One of them is even a set it saves as being in progress. This has great potential, but some issues like this, and not having some smaller sets, holds it back.",
"It appears to have all of the Lego sets both old and new for instruction purposes, but sadly a vast majority of them are not available for adding to the sets you own to it count the number of bricks you own. For the sets that are not shown in their themes menu, you can search for it in the searchbar and find the instructions there. It also lists the parts so you could manually keep track if you want. As an example, I have gotten about52 lego sets since 2007, of those 54, I found 13 in the themes",
Can you enable 3d model mode for older sets? Especially ninjago ones. Pdfs don't really help me that much. Thanks in advance!,
it shows you everything you need can save what you have built and is all a great app if you like to build legos,
Fun App to use but may have some problems with putting the pieces together at some times.,
This is a super awesome app for ANYONE who loves Legos!,
good when you lose the instructions,
"Useful as an extra set of instructions but is basically an pdf library of your Lego sets. I'd love to see it use the capabilities of a phone more like keeping a running countdown of how many of each type of piece should be left in the box as you go, or a rotatable 3D model of what your build should look like.",
love that I can keep everything in one spot,
"App is a battery eater. There is no reason for it, it contains simple images. It has some stupid frilly screen stuff when switching pages that is unnecessary and it can't be avoided, just wastes my time. Just make it simple like the instruction booklet you get with the set. The biggest issue is you can hit save to my sets and the instructions don't appear in the list of My Collection.",
"I have used this app for years but now whenever I select a build, my screen is forced into landscape mode when I have only ever used it in portrait mode which is how I prefer it. The menu still works in portrait so I don't understand why this feature was removed and why landscape mode is forced and no longer optional.",
"Very good for new sets (not all new sets are available in 3D), even though I still have almost all original instructions, I wish there are instructions for old sets from my childhood ('90s). Buttons are too small and too close to the edge of the screen, it's hard for me to navigate, very hard for kids. BUG in the 60209 set; in the police car 3D model, one of a three flat black 2x4 pieces (page 16 in the book) is put wrong, and all folowing pieces that are built on this piece are also put wrong.",
It's good but it would be amazing if on the page for the set there was a list like at the back of the paper booklets of all the pieces needed to complete the set. We have so many broken down sets it would make the app alot more functional for us as we end up needing to root out the booklet anyway,
it helps me move the car around to see were the pieces have yo go than rather look at the regular non movable instructions.,
this is the easy way to keep track of what I have and what I don't have and it's really easy to scan QR codes and do it on your phone instead of using the actual books,
perfect for kids. less gadget,
"An environmentally-friendly alternative to printed instructions. The 3D view is both novel and occasionally genuinely helpful. However, the instructions in this app often leave out important information contained in the printed instructions, such as sticker alignment. If you want all the benefits of digital building instructions without any of the shortcomings, download the PDF instructions instead.",
"This isn't as great as it looks theres a lot of series of sets not on hear like the Ultra agents, hobbit and lord of the rings, galaxy Squad and so on. Plus the Marvel,Chema and lego movie are missing over half of the sets. I was vary excited when I saw this app because I have over the years lost some of the instructions to some my older sets but wanted to ree build them. As far as that this app is pretty good. If yall could add in everything from 2000 to now I think that would be fantastic.",
"Its a good app. It would be useful, and I would give it a higher rating, but it's missing almost half the sets I've tried to add. Not even the lego movie sets made it in, and that's basically their flagship series. It's dissapointing that all the sets I have memories building arent here. A feature to add your own pdf instructions would solve all the issues I have with this app, but lego has never really done well software-wise",
I'am very pleased with this app. It is so helpful when it comes to instructions.,
Much easier to see orientations of pieces and just more fun. Better than using the book,
"The app takes the pleasant experience of building Lego and turns it aggravating. The colors are off, it doesn't highlight what pieces are being added unless you zoom way in, it's hard to see the lines between pieces, the box showing what piece is next sometimes overlays the main diagram and you have to close it, there are no measurements on sticks, and you have sit through these annoying animations when you finish a part. Give me my PDFs back!!! There is no PFD for 910016. I checked.",
"it's great to have access to digital instructions! however, it would be a huge improvement if the images were vector graphics so they don't get so pixelated. also would be nice if they were formatted better for a phone so we don't have to constantly zoom.",
"I love the app for all the current Lego sets it has. But you can tell it's focused on the more popular sets in current times rather than the entire agglomeration. I mostly have older sets that aren't in the system. If I were to change anything, it'd be to add all sets from all time. Otherwise, it's a well made app.",
"Honestly such a wonderful idea, especially for misplaced instruction manuals! My biggest complaint would be the inability to add the older sets to your profile. It doesn't bother me if the instructions aren't there but I would really love to be able to scroll through that whole collection!",
"It is what it is. Useful if you have a set without instructions or want to attempt replicating the build with bricks from other sets. Also useful to see if you want to get the set. Not particularly useful on its own, just as an aid to enjoy constructing with physical LEGO.",
This app fantastic for collectors like myself as you don't have to worry about the direction book getting damaged from use. But it has a frequent habit of crashing and losing track of the build progress on your current set. I really want to give this app 5 stars but the crashing needs to corrected first.,
"The app is a really good idea. There is only 2 issue in my opinion . 1. Very limited amount of lego sets are in the app. 2. Some instructions are only a picture of the original paper instructions. Very hard to use that for a small kid. If this 2 would be fixed, the app would deserve 5 star :)",
"This app is ggreatI haven't even used the things like the barcode (because the sts I'm doing don have them) but it is fine withoug?. I can just look up the set number, and do my set. I have a very old set but it still works, even though the quality isn't great. I'm surprised this even works a Chromebook! Great especially for a Chromebook compatible app!",
"I'm an OG Lego Builder. I'm 39, I've been building since I can remember the huge bin in my basement where I played for hours! (finished basement). Hesitant to use the app to build a set. Tried it. Loved it! screen shared to my TV to enlarge the build instructions for my 4 year old to see. Amazing! Plus, it saves your builds! Yes, really! So that giant collection of Lego build instructions that you have, just stopped growing. You can login and get them instantly now. just make an account!",
"Love this app! use it alot and no issues so far. So good to be able to scan guides and sets quickly, skip back and forth and manipulate the built bits. Wee suggestion, please please add the ability to have more than one account. My son has one I manage and I have a separate one of my own, would be fantastic to switch between the two.",
"This instructions app is great for every set from the Horizon set to the original Starwars Tie Fighter set, helps with building when you have very little space to have the booklet around. However it does have one annoying flaw, the tendency to crash while using the app, I am not sure if it has to do with system memory or the app itself, but this is very annoying when building a set only for it to crash and then not remember where you left off, and especially infuriating for UCS/ expert sets.",
Great up to track the sets I own as well as quick access to instructions to modern sets. While the app has been working flawlessly it keeps crashing now on my Note10+ for no apparent reason. No changes have been made to the handset and it is the only app I am currently having issues with,
"I want to love this app, but I am finding it difficult. I downloaded this as a way to find the instructions to older sets from when I was younger, but even in the odd occasion you find the set. It can't be added to your collection. This makes it difficult to keep track of what your working on. It is convenient for sets that are post 2015, but frustrating for anything earlier. I know there are a metric ton of lego sets over its long history, but it would be nice if the app had all its sets.",
"Awesome to have the instuctions for all these sets available in an app! Would be even more awesome to have older sets listed. Was looking for Castle, Pirates and Vikings sets, but they are are not included. Even with some themes going back to 2008 on the app, some 2008 themes are not listed and Lego City only goes back to 2010 even though it's roots goes all the way back to 1978. Would be great to have access to the whole catalogue of Lego set build instructions.",
"Love this app, great place to get instructions. use a tablet for easier reading. only two small nit picks. sometimes the animation glitches, but doesn't effect readability. and some Lego sets seem to be released before having their instructions put on the app. if thier trying to get rid of the paper instructions this is a competent way of doing so, though I believe for accessibility reasons they should never do that.",
"This app is a great option for those who have lost their instruction manual and need a helping hand with their LEGO builds. I strongly recommend this app as it is a perfect representation of an electronic copy of the manual we know! One slight inconvenience was that it did not include the LEGO sets within the plastic boxes that are sold, or used to be sold, another trouble I had was finding one of my old LEGO instructions I use to have. But despite all of that this app does exactly what I want!",
This Imperial Shuttle was fun to build. This is a real good buy at current price point. It's a great size to when completed. The wings rotate up and down. The very big fin rotates back after you unlatch it. The cockpit rotates forward and you got figures that can sit in the front and rear as well as on the wings. Playability is endless. I'd highly recommend this kit to everyone.,
"Pros: easy to find instructions to your latest additions. Cons: desperately needs a ""jump to page"" function. ""Jump to bag number"" would be handy for newer sets as well. Only has the latest sets. Hard to build a ""digital collection"" if you've been collecting longer than a few years",
"Great app overall, it's easy to use and understand but my one big problem is that it doesn't have old sets (that arent even that old) and don't include every set in a year. For example 2014 Lego star wars had a battle pack that was some clones and a tri droid but it is no where to be found on this app. And that set isn't the only set missing, there are countless sets missing. So please fix this issue",
"For me it's just OK because not all kits have the 3D instructions. The set that we're working on just has the PDF not the 3d images in the app. I'm 4000 miles away and helping my dad build a Mustang through video calls. We're working through it and I'm loving every minute but there's some places where it would be helpful for him to see a series of extra small pieces go together. As it stands right now, the app isn't critical. I can download the PDF from Lego site.",
"While the app works well, it's frustrating that older sets don't show up despite being in the app and have to be searched by name or set number, but worse still is that you can't add them to your collection unless a window pops up giving you a one time opportunity to do so. There simply isn't an option to do so for older sets... I really hope they update this in the future to have a clear option to allow any set to be added to your collection.",
"Freezes every few seconds, and even when it's not frozen half the screen doesn't render so you can't actually see what you're supposed to do with the pieces. In addition (for the set I'm using, anyway), the pieces it's telling you to use are the wrong colour - step 1 uses a piece which doesn't even exist in the whole kit. I'll be using a YouTube video to assemble, because the PDF instructions for the kit don't exist either.",
"On a phone, even a big one, it can be hard to see the instructions and the pictures are pretty low resolution so on a bigger set I'd recommend using a tablet or the actual instructions. Small sets are fine IMO.",
"This is an app just for the sake of having an app. The small screen size doesn't compare well with the printed instructions. Worse still, navigation is almost nonexistent; whereas, when using a PDF version of the instructions, Acrobat has a rich choice of controls, allowing you to jump to a chosen page. Not recommended.",
"I liked being able to download instructions for any set, but this app is an extreme resource hog. While this is running, the entire phone bogs down. Simple operations like unlocking my phone go from instant to taking 5-10 seconds. While this app is running, other core functions (like taking phone calls) actually don't work -- the phone won't ring.",
"This app is pure garbage. We were given a Lego Mario set for Christmas that came with no instruction manual--just a QR code to download the app. The screen is locked in portrait mode which is an awful experience for building lego sets. The zoom/scroll interactions are abysmally slow, and when I zoom in the images are fuzzy and difficult to see studs clearly, and I routinely end up scrolling to the next page when I just want to see the next step. It's an absolutely horrid UX.",
"Too slow and to bulky. The search kicks in after 2 characters are entered to the search bar and prevents additional key presses from displaying, until you get the search results (of the first 2 key presses) back. Even if the correct number is entered, it returns search results, that have absolutely nothing in common with the search term. Then you click on your lego set, and it doesn't add it to your collection. You need to click an ambiguous button to add it to your collection. Pretty poor.",
"Should add the ability to delete downloaded PDF instead of having to delete everything through app setting. Many of the 2023 sets can't be found on the app. Also, all the GWP kits are also missing. There should be a function which allows people add more than one of the same set. Furthermore, somewhere on the sets info page should allow users to tap to visit the sets product page by loading the user's browser so he/she can make a purchase of he/she would like to.",
This is a great app and allows you to keep a track of your growing collection as well as being able to easily find the instructions for any of your sets instantly. The only reason I've not rated this 5 🌟 is that there are eta not listed on the app but for which the instructions are available on the support website. Please add more of the older sets.,
"The instructions plus constantly goes into a state where you can't select the x or the progress bar, forcing you to go back. Otherwise the app is nice. It would be cool to have all lego sets ever in it...",
I really like this app and I like how you can move the build to see certain parts. The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because for the creator 3 in 1 sets (the one I encountered this problem with was set 31107 or the space rover one) it would have all 3 builds in one instruction manual so say I want to build the 2nd one then I have to scroll untill it starts and it's really annoying,
Good if you've lost instructions but I would have expected it to be slicker and more interactive. Too many clicks and we gave up and reverted to paper. Very much a missed opportunity for Lego to make something really useful.,
So Lego no longer prints instructions for certain sets that go with sets forcing you to download an app. The app is garbage QR code scanner doesn't work tells me I have the wrong code if the camera focuses at all to scan. Finding them on the app is just as frustrating looking through catalogs trying to find your set. The argument could be made that they are saving paper going green however I have a whole paper booklet of advertisements for other sets so what exactly is it?,
"I figured out how to add sets but it needs to be a little easier. When I scan a code it should just say add to your collection like it used to. I would love to see Lego offer suggestions from all the parts that knows you have from all the sets that are in your collection of things that you can build with them. Or even go to the community and have that ability But for downloading instructions, the app works well",
"Easy to use but limited catalog. I thought I would be able to use this to catalog all my sets but as I was searching I found that the vast majority of sets are not included in this. Hopefully Lego will continue to update the app with sets from their retired collections. However there is no indication of that. You guys just bought Bricklink, you might want to take that into consideration when building apps such as this. Your adult fan base is going to start pushing on you more.",
"Love technics but this App suffers basic, easy to fix bugs that make it a pain to use, such as frequently losing the page you've got to in the PDF viewer between sessions. To top it off, the PDF render is not high resolution by any standard which makes it difficult on some more complex models to check alignment of pieces (e.g. During gearbox build in Technics BMW RR). Why the 3D viewer feature was dropped escapes me... Lego please, these are simple low hanging fruit improvements! 🤙 Me",
"It's OK. With no other LEGO instruction apps available, if you're a kit builder, this app is worth having. Very basic. Download able pdf's exact of instruction booklets. Personal collection is automatically sorted for you by the app, by theme. Good option if you don't want to use your physical instruction books.",
"It's nice to have somewhere to look for set instructions in case we lose the books, but I'm a little disappointed it doesn't model things in a more advanced & interactive way. If you keep the instructions, there's no point to the app.",
"Really glad to see they finally made an easy and accessible way to view build instructions, am able to get rid of so many instruction booklets. Would be nice if I could toss them all, but there are older sets from the '10s that are not on here. The app is great the only reason for 4* is their ""about info"" claims to have all instructions for sets from 2015 to today but I can not find at least 2 of my sets from 2015 on the app. Tried searching by set name, set number, and series.",
"App looks awesome and love it in principle but, unfortunately repeated attempts to save instructions to my account stops at 2 sets of instructions. I can find further sets with ease but they appear and then disappear from my account almost instantly. Is this a bug or a weird paywall for data management?",
"It's alright for casual users but there are random sets that aren't in their system which means you will likely end up with an incomplete collection record. For example, I was able to pull up a Star Wars set (7171) from 1999, yet a set I bought in 2018 failed to show up (40220).",
"Awesome app but missing the opportunity to add any set to your collection. Older sets have the pdf in there so I do not see the issue of adding them to the collection. It is nice to have an overview. As a developer, besides serverspace, it cannot be hard to add this feature 😀! Or is it a bug that I cannot add older sets?",
"excellent. Its like working in 3d CAD but the layout and views/animated transitions are so friendly it's a great intro to modeling for kids. Using the booklets are probably better for young minds, but this is great every now and then. Over age 6, I'd use the 3d mainly and the book sometimes to keep that ands on/manual reference skill healthy.",
"Downloaded a few years ago to save set manuals before the kids trashed them. When trying to save a recent set, I couldn't figure out my login and thought all hope was lost for the other sets. THANK GOODNESS all the Legos manuals are there, you can EASILY search for which one you need and save it to your profile! Not to mention others you may have all the pieces for and want to build! So happy with this app and the endless possiblities it presents! WE LOVE LEGOS AND THE LEGOS APP!",
The app is decent except I would add an additional feature for large lego collectors such as myself even if u have no instructions nor a picture we should be able to add it to our collection just so ik I have that set instead of researching the set I would really like to have everything in one app even when I'm overseas I don't need a paper or computer or notes on the phone just a simple app that I can view all. I believe the community would assist getting instructions you may not have access to,
I find this app almost useless. Using the search bar and getting something semi relevant to what you typed is a joke. Most of sets don't have pictures so you can't tell what you are looking at until after you tap the set. There aren't many sets on the app. Goodluck gong to the Lego website. It's just as bad.,
"Nearly every time I open a set there isn't a QR code to scan. Why not be able to text search for the set instead of relying on a barcode that's never there. I've only ever had the code to scan once or twice, every other one doesn't have a code! These aren't old sets either, brand new!",
"Good app, lets you build collections but it is incredible that Lego doesn't keep or make available vintage set instructions. I know they are available but looking for instructions, even from relatively recent sets (e.g. 10 years old) draws a blank. They should really sort that out.",
"I downloaded the app to make putting together a set with little space easier. And it worked great for that, but when I went to make an account to save what I've completed to find it easier if needed. My issue with it is the fact that if I make an account as an adult, I am then required to make an account for my child. Besides that, no major issues.",
"I dread apps, this one is great. Just does what it needs to do without frilly stuff and tap-arounds, and subscribe that trash, and tap on this other stuff. I had what I needed in very little time. Shortly after installed, it took me less than 2 min. to find the instructions and rebuild some stuff my kiddo pulled apart. Thank you, LEGO people. ❤️",
"Quite handy for building but could do with ways to more easily navigate the instructions' pages. Also, a LOT of sets are missing from the catalogue. For example, while the Black Seas Barracuda is listed, almost no other classic pirate set made the cut. Where's the love for Eldorado Fortress and the Skull's Eye Schooner? This could be a perfect app to keep track of one's collection and simultaneously provide easy instructions, but for now it's better to just keep using paper instructions.",
"is fantastic. The only thing I found unnecessary was it would show what parts you need, then show to connect them, then show to connect them again sometimes. It made the build time slower cause now you have to flip through an extra page every few steps.",
"Very good app, and really love the 3D part, just a comment for the developers, while in the 3D option, if the child shifts the slider quickly to see all the pages, when going back to the page we were on, then the next button stops working and the app needs to be restarted.",
I would give 5* if it worked and did what I'd advertised. The only plus I can give is the fact you can zoom into the instruction book which I find the one that comes with the model you can't and can be very difficult for folk with sight problems. As far as lego is concerned I am a late starter at 51 lol but just couldn't resist the nostalgic film models? Back to the future and ghostbusters. I will add lego need to do a lot better? Pieces should be where there meant to be not in other bags!!,
This app is fantastic and incredibly useful. I always use it in place of the physical book. But it would be great if you could jump to a desired page in the instructions. When you want to look at the last page of a 400+ book you have to scroll all the way to the end which takes a long time. Please consider adding this as a feature. Other than that this is a great app.,
I would really like to be able to download and print the PDFs so that my kids don't have to keep my phone with them for hours on end building. Even better I would prefer 3 in 1 packs to come with all 3 sets of instructions. The app works quite well in terms of its purpose but does freeze or skip pages now and again,
"I can find PDF instructions of older sets, but can't add them to my collection. Why? I just want to bookmark the ones I own. That's the only reason I created my Lego account. 3D instructions are fine, but I still prefer the PDFs. Why do you have a separate app for Super Mario sets?! I tried opening the instructions in this app and only got promo materials, and a notification that the princess's instructions are in another castle. I'm not going to install a new app for each series.",
Makes the building process more tedious and more difficult. Transitions between steps are slow even with animations disabled. The mkst glaring flaw is a lack of outline on what parts are added to the model on steps like in paper instructions. Makes it incredibly difficult to tell where pieces are placed,
would 100% give it a 5 if it actually let you add old sets to your profile instead of ones within just the last 3 or so years. Missed opportunity. finding old sets is a bit off. Unless you know the kit number or name they often don't show up. As far as new sets the app is amazing. Nice not having to have all the physical instructions.,
"App crashes while loading instructions. (Edit) supported devices list is 6 devices, ancient S4 mini is one of them for context. My device is a pixel 4a. By asking if device is supported is disingenuous... It's apparent the developer needs to do a thorough review of their code based on recent reviews, instead of blaming user devices.",
There is no way to easily access the standard Android navigation to close the app. You have to navigate PDFs page by page with no fast scrolling. It's frankly easier to download the instructions from the website and use your own browser.,
"Liked it better when it was part of the Lego Life app. Sure, this is easier to navigate than LL, but i can't get the 3D instructions to load like i was able to in that app. This app just crashes. It's so disappointing! Edit: Tried their suggestion to reinstall but of course that didn't do anything to help. Oh and the ""list of compatible devices"" is an absolute joke. Ridiculous.",
The app is good option for experiencing the build with a story. For people who would need instructions can be provided with a download link with only instructions within the app. The problem with this app for me is the phone overheats if we are using it for over 15 mins. My phone is s10plus and none other app cause phone to overheat. Some performance tuning needs to be done for the app to reduce using cpu this much.,
"Worked great for awhile, then suddenly if left open to long the app would crash and you'd lose your place. Now the app won't even allow me to login, so though I can still view instructions, I can't keep my collection up to date. Already restarted the device and even reinstalled the app to no help.",
"Here's another problem with the i'm having. When you're in the middle of using the instructions, if you leave the app for any reason, be it reading a text, or whatever, the app restarts. Even after a 5 second check of a text! Just letting you know 👍",
"This works great on my phone, but I often have to zoom in for some of the more complex builds. When I try to download it onto my laptop it has one icon saying it is available for my device, but then when I try it says my device isn't eligible. It would be 5 stars if it was possible to use on a bigger screen.",
Every Lego set ever with pdf downloads for each set even the very first sets that came out you could also use the instructions to build sets with the cheaper no name brand bricks that you can purchase in bulk and build similar if not the same things as long as you have the majority of the right pieces. Absolutely an excellent app I could not ask for want anything more for free. If you are a lego fan this app is a must for if your looking to get in Lego this is the place to find the right set,
This app is awesome. Booklets can get folded and rolled and a pain to keep open when building. And bigger sets where you have to attach big parts can have weord angles hard to so where things connect. This app gives you a 3d model step by step. Its awesome.,
"It's good and it's not good. I like being able to keep a log of sets I have but unfortunately, many are not even on there. It tells me the item is not found. Doesn't make sense why not all sets are on there. I like the quick check on parts you may be missing through the instructions. In some ways it's handy and in other ways I'm hoping for a better app.",
"The keyboard doesn't work, so I can't manually enter set numbers. Very frustrating, especially when the qr codes don't scan correctly. Great when it works well, but so frustrating when it doesn't (which is often)",
I generally love the app. But whenever I try to log in with my son's username it freezes on me. 😒 No idea why. It just doesn't work anymore. I just want to make sure the sets we have stored here are linked to his name and won't get lost when / if we change devices.,
"The app design is very basic with minimum range of features could be provided for users. If looking for an instruction for something can't find, there is no suggestions for combinations could have if we have several sets. The current instructions is PDF which is not user friendly inside the app. There are many potential improvements which I don't know why ignore by LEGO!",
"How depressing that my fun time with my little kid has been hijacked by this nonsense, with us both staring at a screen in frustration. This app is a vampire. The whole concept of online-only instructions is shady. The development of the instructions and animations must also be a huge overhead because the kit itself isn't nearly as good as you'd expect for the price",
"Cool app! I'd like it to be a better collection tracker. You can't add individual minifigures only full sets of them, also can't add individual bricks to keep track of...but I'm not sure that's the goal here.",
"Big downgrade from paper instructions: have to have a device, hard to see on phones, big battery drain, you don't own the instructions, slow loading times, and cluncky controls. Unfortunately, for some sets (bricklink designer, Mario) this is only option.",
"Pretty useful, but incomplete. Missing a lot of sets. Some set have the incorrect number (Elsa's magical castle for example). No wish list feature. Edit: They keep updating it! Better and better every month!",
I think this app is awesome. You can scan the code from your Lego set and it gives you easy to follow instructions right on your device. I love that it saves them on this app so if you ever lose the paper instructions for your set you'll still have them on your device to go back and look at so you can build again and again.,
It is nice to have the manuals available. Lego sets will not save and stay on my account. The boxes say to look up online for alternate builds but they are no where to be seen. Just the original manual.,
"Great little app, I only use it for technics sets that I collect for my son. when you buy two models and combine them to make a third model, this is very handy. I would give five stars but the instructions don't cover models from older sets. If there could be a search by set numbers I would be able to add more to my sons collection on the app and download all the instructions I need for the extra models to build with him. 8/10",
Wish the colors were brighter. Hard to tell them apart sometimes. Would also like to be able to zoom in. Overall love this! Now I have a way to retain the books in case one of my many sets are dropped or something!,
"App is non-usable for Instruction sets. It offers a PDF, but opening it only has < > arrows. Meaning youre forced to click to get where you need to. It constanly crashes, so if youre on page 300 you need to go back in & click 300 times to get to page 300. Dear Lego, a usable PDF viewer offers a scrollable button on the right hand side of the screen where if you drag with your finger, it will quickly take the user to the page they need. This can easily be integrated/replaced with those arrows.",
"was at a friend's house and spotted an instruction manual for an old set. goy the set number, put it in the search box and voilà, full in structures as if it were the manual itself. cool thing is you can save them to your favourites so you don't need to search for stuff everytime.",
"App is handy to keep track of your collection, it's also convenient having access to the instructions for sets, but they are slow and clunky, I've found a pdf on PC/laptop is much quicker and easier to navigate than the app.",
"Having to download instructions for how to build lego sets is absolutely ridiculous. The app takes too long to load. Once the file has downloaded - images are blurred. Had too go online and find better instructions on different website. Takes longer to find instructions, than it does to build the things. Then the fun of building sets is ruined somewhat. Paper instruction booklets please (on recycled paper - if it's an environmental issue)!!!!",
I'm very fond of this app! I like adding sets to my collection so I can rebuild them without the box. A cool feature would be if you could manually input the page number instead of scrolling forever (useful for e.g. the 3-in-1 sets if you wanna know where a piece used to be),
"Great app when working. However it does clitch terribly. When I click on a theme, and exit out of it, the theme profile sticks and moves with the header when I scrole. Bit disappointing quality from Lego, especially since the app had a lot of potential.",
"Regularly forgets your location in instructions. Doesn't seem to save unless you exit the app in a specific way. EDIT: I have been signed into my LEGO account since the moment I downloaded the app. Still if I close the app while inside instructions it does not save my place. I need to use the X in the corner of the screen or the back button to save my progress, which doesn't happen if I am clicking a notification. However I am changing it from 2 to 3 stars since figuring that out has let me save",
The app is great but could use one little tweak. Add a way to put how many of a set you have I have multiples of one set in the art themes and 3 in 1 themes and some others. Would be nice to keep track of counts on them all not just have 1 in the app but I have 5 in reality.,
Fix your app. 3D instructions Constantly crashes even with high end phones. Used to work now crashes when using 3D instructions. Followup: The below suggestions do not work. This is on multiple devices on Android and IOS. The 3D component clearly needs attention. It is a shame because my 4 year old would have loved to use the 3D instructions again.,
Absolutely hateful! Keeps randomly closing! When I reopen I am never at spot where I was at in the build. Trying to go thru pages keeps kicking me to either first page or last page. I have the Continued Building link but same issue!! I keep app up to date but constant troubles!!,
i didn't have this as a kid and now that I'm helping my son build its amazing how you can keep up with all of your instruction books in one app also if you need replacement parts you can contact their website and it makes it easier for both parties because you have everything in one app! it's definitely worth it!,
"Great app, but would like a more snappy layout. There are too many animations when opening/closing/changing pages, even tapping some buttons leaves me waiting for 3 seconds while it animates itself. Edit: Please ready reviews before commenting on them. Your animations are too long.",
"One thing that really bugs me is the fact that some sets cannot be added to my collection, those that doesn't have a front cover that is. On that matter, it really is suprising since an app by LEGO doesn't have the box cover for multiple sets.",
"Love the ability to add sets and look at some of the instructions from some older sets however I have several retired sets from the Mars mission batch and some are 2007 and I cant add them to my collection, you guys add a cool feature but its pretty incomplete for someone who has some older sets and can't add them to their collection.",
"Handy app for building sets! Only thing I'd add: When I add sets to my collection, presumably Lego then knows what pieces I have. So, just perhaps, there are some old retired sets that I could build using these pieces! If Lego could identify what sets I could construct with the pieces I own, that'd be awesome. And then, let's say I want to build a retired set. Lego could say ""if you purchase these modern sets, you'll have all the pieces you need to build this old retired set!""",
"Great app, I just hope this is not the future of Lego instructions with no booklets in the box, I would be happy for the cheaper sets to not include booklets but we pay alot of money for other sets and having the booklets is part of the fun/collection, basically save the planet unless it effects my collection of booklets :)",
"Great set for young creative Lego players. lots of pieces for them to build on their own, but also build plans for those that need a little help. An app with Lego cartoon characters keeps the play going. Three minifigures and six anamals give lots of playtime. Also, how many other sets have Lego bird poo in it.",
The app is good but I can't add all the sets to my library even though they are on the app and instructions are available. The app is convenient to use when the manual is big so I don't have to crease the cover.,
its a very good app. unfortunately i have found out alot of sets have yet to be added into the system. i would really like a way to catalog how many of each piece you have and be able to add random lego pieces vs just the set we buy.,
They include all the retired sets so that if you don't have the manual you can get it here.,
Great for Lego collectors like me to keep track of every Lego you have and also if you lose your instruction booklets or they're damaged Lego builder gots you covered.,
"Criminal that a Lego set for 6 year olds doesn't come with instructions anymore and requires you to download an app to try and assemble. Grubby data harvesting from a company that used to be kid oriented in the physical world, and is now pushing kids into staring at a screen to play. Following the instructions is a huge life skill and allowing them to work by themselves through the build is fun and a great skill set for the future. Now just watching movies. Bad business decision.",
made my first ever lego set and this was the best instructional manual ever and I can't wait to make way more. 15/9,
"Absolutely hate this. Sets no longer come with instructions so you are forced to put your kid in front of a screen just to build this. You can’t even download it to print yourself unless you screenshot each individual page and spend a small fortune printing. In order to use these overpriced bricks the way they were intended, I have to buy my 5year old a device because it isn’t even supported by older devices. I hope this changes or I will just have my kid rebuild old sets and not buy another new",
it is really challenging,
this is excellent except that i can't find my parents sets from the 70s and 80s but perhaps that's asking a bit too much,
"So disappointed that this has turned into an app. You try to get away from having the kids constantly on a device and Lego instructions are now on a device. Yet the price hasn't decreased with Lego not having to print instructions... no surprise there!! and I shouldn't have to print my own .... You can use recycled paper for instructions, that's being sustainable. Me having to charge my phone to read the instructions is not sustainability. So really, you've saved nothing Lego.",
just think a phone number should be available for ordering any parts(Custom or not) to aid in this spectacular lego art!,
"Overall, amazing app. My only problem with this app is that it seems that the 3D model to help you build is only for younger children, which sort of upsets me because I got this app specifically for that purpose. Everything else works amazing though, 9/10. (If there is a way to use 3-D for older people, and im just dumb, I'll change the review lol)",
"This app gets the job done and it is much more convenient than paper instructions. There are a few bugs with searching and navigation but once you get to the instructions, it works great.",
"I build LEGO with my 4 year old, and i have to say this app is awesome!! It is so easy for him to use and with the ability to zoom and rotate the pieces it makes it so easy for him to tell exactly where the smaller pieces should fit. I would highly recommend this app and would give it 10 stars if i could!",
Work good for most model but the 2 and 1 it doesn't work for the second model ( like for Example I bought the grave digger but it won't load the Instructions for the off road buggy it crashes every time I try to load it so I have to build grave digger cus it doesn't come with a book for the buggy) I tried closing the app and reopening it that didn't fix it even tried uninstall it and reinstalling it and that didn't fix it eather,
This would d a great app but you need a QR code to add any sets to collection and what about minifigures you have to have every single one of them to add the whole entire set you can't add them one by one I have plenty of sets and minifigures but lots of them are individual and don't have QR codes is there anyway to go around this or can you guys fix it? It would be really cool to be able to catalogue my whole collection,
Very cool app for those wondering how a particular set is assembled. Really helps me understand some of the more difficult building techniques the pros use. But also good if you have a large Lego collection and want to try piecing together a certain set with your random pieces.,
"Brilliant ! exactly what we need. My only gripe would be that 'content is king' and some of the sets on here don't have box art and worse.. complete genre's e.g. Castle, Pirates are completely missing. It's the older sets that having the missing or battered instruction are the ones we need the most!",
"Constantly crashes, unusable. UNACCEPTABLE!!!! We bought a set, the boost, that does not come with a paper instruction book anymore. It is basically unusable since the app crashes and we can't even get to the page where my kid needs to be to continue so the toy is unusable. We payed 100 euros for a toy that can't be used... If you want to go digital, make sure your tools work. I'm seriously frustrated by this and so is my kid...",
I am upping this from a one star to a three star because WHEN it's working it's decent. My kids like it because they can turn over the parts and see what they look like so they can find them easier. I am still not a fan. I tried the PDF website but Bricklink special limited edition sets are only available as digital not PDF so we are stuck using this for our very expensive specialty sets... There are no paper instructions and it definitely devalues the formerly screen free Lego experience.,
"Horrible. Will I like the idea of saving paper, I don't appreciate buying a lego set and not getting instructions I paid for. This is way more complicated then need be. I don't want to play games. I simply want to know how to build this set lego by lego and your app sucks at that which is crazy because literally the QR scan should have just taken me to the instruction not waste data, thus, costing me more money only to still not be able to find the instructions. Lego is too expensive for this.",
"Bit slow, and I can't see all the sets on the market. I recently bought a Legoland set but it is not on here. Apart from that, it can be good for keeping track of a few sets you own, and the animations for the instructions are cool.",
"While installing I opted out of sharing extra usage data. When I tapped, ""I agree,"" the usage data ""switch"" slid (on its own) to the ""opt in"" position right before the app switched to the main menu. IMMEDIATELY Uninstalled.",
Really cool how you can rotate and zoom in on the build. Totally Recommend this app!,
I love that in to see my Lego instructions that are ripped up and add them. One problem I think that this app should show ALL of the lego instructions ever because I have a few lego sets that will not show any where even when I write in the number. I also do not know the name of the lego set on some and I also don't know the number. One tiny problem: when I click a catagory and exit it moves with the screen.,
"My boys were handed the gift by grandpa, so excited! They want to rip open the box and build immediately!!! Then, they can't. Last thing we want to do is start messing with QR codes and apps. We need a smart device with appropriate space available, and graphics. The one we had, didn't work. We went to this site just to look for backup instructions. There aren't any!!! The kids are soooo upset. This was a total fail experience, and there does need to at least be a backup . Terrible",
"The design is well done, simple and nice looking, easy to navigate as well. Unfortunately, the app keeps crashing every time I try to open up a sets instructions.",
I love Technic Lego the details in each model is a new experience every time. Nothing disappoints me. I've just completed the Porsche 99X and I loved every minute. It takes you to a completely different place! 😊😊,
"Great app, I love the extra builds available on some of the 3 in 1 sets that are available in app. It would be nice if it had a kindle compatible version for the fire tablets for my son to use on his kids tablet and not have to use my phone.",
"It's a great app, but there's one thing I'm annoyed by. The fact that it doesn't include all the instructions from each theme. Only as far back as between 2016 and 2017. Maybe there can be an option (in the app) to include all the set instructions. You know, for us collectors.",
When I open the app it shows a white screen with a Lego logo and then freezes. I got set 60353 and there are no physical or pdf instructions so since the app won't work it was a waste of money. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app multiple times and it still won't work.,
"(second review, first one got deleted) I love this app. However, I recently found a Lego System set's instructions in my basement, and I was very sad to find out that Lego System sets are not in this app. If so please make this possible. Also I would like to view old sets like the Cars 2 sets",
great app for organising my collection and finding intruc for older sets 👌. still missing few sets buy I'm sure they'll be updated into it soon,
"Cool app. I love to build some houses, even ideas and missions of Lego City. Well, doesn't have all the 1995 sets of Lego Duplo available I wish we're, missing some Toddler Build and Boat Fun (set 10567) on the Lego Duplo Collection. Don't forget to find ""Everything is Awesome"" set, LEGO Education sets and some LEGO Legoland Sets. Is that Everything you need for the update and feedback?",
I was very excited about this app. The compatibility is absolutely horrible. It essentially opens a video player to show you the instructions. You're better off downloading individual pdf files for your instructions. I hope they fix this.,
This app is good and I like to use it to keep track of the sets I have but it's very disappointing that none of the old sets are there like Lego set 6655 which I do have. And some of the newer sets aren't on there either like the 2016 Lego city petrol station. Which is another set I have. I hope the next update will focus on adding more sets new and old so I can have a full list of all the sets I have. It would also be cool to rate sets from 0 to 10.,
"Just installed the app to begin building the 2in1 Technic Grave Digger/buggy kit, 42118. Goes through 2-3 pages to start instructions and instantly crashes. Tried the instructions for the '65 Blue Ford Mustang kit, loaded with no problems even went through about 30 pages to make sure its not my phone. Galaxy Note 10 Latest Android version.",
I really like the app and that it has mostly any instruction set you might need and even some of the 4th instruction booklet for the 3-1 sets but I am a little sad they haven't added any new brickheadz from 2022. It's fun adding sets to your collection but it's less fun when some of the themes only have sets from 2021 and nothing newer? Hopefully they update it soon because I've been having a lot of fun with it.,
Good app and a great alternative to the books (especially when my daughter likes to get her hands on them). Says it has instructions for all sets back to 2006 but seems to be missing Lego Iconic Chess Set (40174) which was a 2017 release.,
"Great concept, playing it with a missions pack with my son, but the App needs work: 1. Test on low powered devices, app needs serious optimization. This is for kids (mostly), not all have the latest and greatest. Plus device gets hot. 2. Clear block images do not show.",
"It is an easy app to use. How ever if you are looking anything that is old good luck. My opinion is if your going to have an app that is lego instructions have all the instructions available. I understand the data base would be of a good size, but that's the way everything is going.",
"There are some small glitches where the main product image are late to appear when I moved to another product. But the rest of the app are great! Can't wait to see more products in the library, especially some older sets I have until today (Exo Force and Bionicle G1).",
"I really like the app, however, you are missing a good portion of sets. It doesn't have the TMNT theme (even retired) or a lot of 2016 Batman sets. And while I don't quite care, it could use them.",
it's great except the ads but I'll recommend it,
"When in search mode, the fullscreen feature makes it difficult to navigate back. On the search pages, the scroll feel is NOT native android, it overshoots and scrolls too far for too long time. It looks good but just does not feel right.",
"Painfully slow and glitchy. Almost unusable. Worse again that it means children are spending more time on screens. Please go back to including printed instructions, the app is an awful experience.",
This app seems quite buggy. I've just started using it and added some sets to my collection. However it keeps deleting one the sets. I'm wondering if it doesn't allow you to save more than 5 sets? Or if you can't save more than two different types of collections? Either way it's useless if you can't save more.,
"The 3D build instructions are removed in this last update. It would appear they remove them after a year. My son started a technic build using 3D now it's only a pdf of the included instructions. I get they want to push this years releases, but to actively remove features from previously bought sets is just the worst marketing ploy...",
"Some pretty recent sets are not available (40460 Roses, 40416 Ice rink, 40426 Seasonal Wreath) Please add a feature to be able to share (and compare) our collection with friends",
"It's a good idea, but there's too many crashes on both my phone and tablet. And not being able to directly select a page to go to really makes the crashes worse.",
A good app overall BUT not all the sets are listed on the app which is frustrating. I like to keep upto date with adding my sets to see how many sets I have and to see how many parts in total I have but without all sets listed ot added its disappointing 😞,
"Hello lego, if you go on to the ninjago, ninja sub speeder page 75. Try to do it,it wont fit. I am complaining because i got this set for 85 dollars.",
"This used to be an amazing app, I would have given it a full five stars. Now, I can't even log into the app. Very disappointing.",
Excellent App it helped me find the instructions of some sets thanks Lego 💛,
"This app has the right idea but it lacks inclusivity. For example, my son had a hard time finding the instructions and told me that we had to download an app for the proper instructions. While I was downloading this app I thought ""what if kids who don't have access to the internet or have parents who struggle with technology were to use this? "" Back when the instructions were in the box, we had no problem putting toys together. It would help if the box had a bigger advertisement of the app.",
"So glad I found this app. I've been building LEGOS for over 20 years. I stopped for a long time, but kept my collection. I've recently been getting my 3 and 4 year old children into Legos but the 3 year old loves to destroy the books. this is the perfect way to keep track of our collection and always have access to the books.",
I really enjoy this app I prefer using the actual books when building sets but there are times when you can't find your instructions. One criticism I have of the app is I enjoy the archiving feature so you can click each category and find out which sets you have but certain sets even though it has the PDF instructions you can't click and add it to your archive. Seems like that would be an easy fix,
fantastic love the 4 player building feature!,
"This is my first mission set, though it may be great fun for a child, but only if they can access internet, and terrible for an adult. also, part of the kit experience e is having the instruction books. nice option, horrible forced..",
dosen't auto save your progress if you close the app in any other way then the X. Even if you press X it won't save on other phone/tablet. Worst thing about this app...you need the Internet to have access or it dosen't work. we should be able to use it offline and since the app dosen't sync whit other phone/tablet on the same account why do you need Internet once we have our manual?,
"the normal instructions were good but when using the 3D instructions, they wouldn't load completely and the pictures were mostly white with most of the parts not showing up on the screen. tried reloading, restarting tablet, reinstalling the app with no success.",
"hella cool, easy to use, and good for people with adhd and or need more visual help with building",
"I cannot add sets to my profile. I will click add, they show up on my list for about 5 seconds and then disappear from my list. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still doesn't work. It's unusable as a way to keep a collection of my sets and instructions.",
These digital instructions are awesome! my 6 year old was able to put her lego set together completely by herself. she was so excited and super proud of herself. I've loved legos since I was a kid and I'm so happy to be able to share this with her and to see the way Lego has used technology to better their product.,
I love the option for digital instructions. Intuitive you can change the perspective to see exactly where the parts go and see how many parts you should have.,
Amazing makes collecting and building Lego set so much more fun,
"It was fun, exciting and just awesome!",
"Nobody's head explodes from being shoot with a .50 rifle round, no naked pretty ladies, (I would give more stars for that) no political intrigue, no car chases, no farm animals grazing outside... or inside, and no carpet washing tips. It's the same instructions that come with the Lego sets on paper only It's on your electronic device, and other Lego themed stuff. Kinda' what you would expect.",
Not good you don't even get a costom nickname and the earn points does not work and I don't get any points😠,
"Amazing, helpful, and fun!!",
"Great app to help you keep up with ALL the sets that you have. Downside is that it's not updated with new sets, bought a new set and it doesn't find it since the last update was 5/12/21. Suggest having the sets adding once release date, even if it is an early release.",
"The instructions are essential to legos, like cereal and milk. The instructions are very explanatory, and easy to understand. I especially enjoy the barcode that allows you to use your smartphone to view it in a 3D space. My son absolutely loves this 2 character pack, and I'm sure your kids or grandkids will absolutely love this out any lego pack.",
easier than the instructions,
I couldn't use it. The app displayed a no internet connection message but my phone was connected and all other apps can access internet without any issue even I can stream video. The message is intermittent and I can't use the app at all.,
"I really do not like needing to have space on my phone for Lego manuals. much prefer a printed version. will not buy Legos in future if it has all digitized. Luigi is super cute though. the set is really neat, especially for young (5 yr) kids",
"Absolutely infuriating. I can't find the instructions for the set I have, and when I do, it's just the useless pamphlet that comes with the set. The navigation and zoom are nightmarish. Just give me a printed manual so I never have to deal with this again. Also, why did I have to download a different Lego app? Why isn't this Mario set in the Mario app I already have? edit: no, the newer sets aren't in there, which is why I downloaded this one.",
Loads of fun for the little ones,
We liked it better before the last update. Anyways the app is very good,
Just awful. Doesnt work well at all,
it's a very neat way to build,
this is fun you can search anything and you build it,
I love that I can use the app to help me build my set.,
"I love the app, and it's very user-friendly, however, I could not enter all of my sets. I have some older sets from the Lego friends theme that aren't in the app. I have set number 41005, 3189, 41038, 41033, and a few smaller sets as well, but none of them are in the app. Over all it's an amazing app, but it doesn't have all of the sets.",
"I'm on a pixel 4 and I found that this app is pretty slow and when I try to go to the home screen, I have to pull up the navigation bar thing and I found this to be kind of annoying. I would rate it five star if this app were faster and easier to use.",
"This app is nice for those who have limited space to and especially for those who take on the longer projects. Let's be honest, some of those books get really thick and tedious to flip the pages in, haha.",
Fun build with my 3 y/o,
"Nice app! Although, a lot of discontinued themes' pages are missing sets. For example Lord of the Rings doesn't even include Lotr sets, just Hobbit. Or Bionicle, 2001 doesn't include the original Toa, yet they're the most iconic Bionicle sets!",
Finally a place to keep track of all my sets! Amazing. Only issue is I'm not able to add in two of my sets because they were limited issue. SO cool to be able to see how many pieces I have in total!,
"3d works very well on phone but terrible on tablet. Once a piece is rotated in 3d the resulting bricks are only partially rendered, making it unusable. The speed in 3d mode suggests rendering it is being done in software and not hardware.",
"App doesn't install on my tablet, luckily I have access to another smaller device that I can use. I'm a little frustrated with the experience and can only imagine what it would be like if I didn't have an alternate device or worse, what it would be like to get a Lego set without the privilege of affording access to a cell phone or computer.",
"Theres only one set on the castle page which is the Disney Castle. I think the page should be removed because the page is pretty much useless to have a page a with only one set. The set on the page should be removed and be put on to the Disney page since you know, it's Disney themed. But once theres an actual set that is a castle and isn't based off something pop culture and it's just Lego itself, you can bring back the page. I am just telling one thing that you should fix in the app.",
Awesome app! my son loved it. he was able to use the booklet and check everything out while I used my phone and helped him build! now he wants to get ALL the lego sets on the planet he says so we can build them all cause having it on my phone the way I do is like magic he says. and now we won't ever lose the directions and can build the Legos anywhere we are! haha def cool idea! thumbs up for sure!,
"Love the app. Absolutely a life saver for my lost instructions. Problem is its misding some sets. I got this set when it came out and its not on the app. Director krennics shuttle. The big one, not the small",
"Great for ""older"" eyes",
"I love this set ! I just wish this app would of let me virtually build it , clicking every piece into place myself .",
"It's better than paper manuals, but I wish moving through the (essentially) PDFs was easier in the app. Overall I'm pleased, just wish it was a bit less clunky to navigate the manuals.",
This is super frustrating!!! This is also no better than the paper instructions that was given. The only thing that you can do is to zoom in. Thats it. Nothing else. Please make it 3D so you can rotate the items because i cannot see it. Do not download this and i would rather stick with the paper instructions. 1 star.,
"App used to be great, then after an update the keyboard is no longer available when searching for sets. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling and restarting without any luck. Hopefully they'll come out with a fix.... Using Pixel 4a on Android 11.",
Can not search by set number and spams you with adverts to buy kits within 30 seconds of install. Avoid.,
"Lego should not rely on an app. I don't want to lend my phone to my kids so they can build kits.The stories are more disruptive than add to the experience. If an app is essential, at least make it easier to find the right steps for each kit",
"Great so far. It's the instructions all on your phone so even if we don't have the book we can put everything back together again. If your into putting Legos together it's a good idea to have this app. We as a family love to put them together, so if there are multiple bags one group can put one together while the other works on the 2nd bag.",
Is fun and very useful to fix the lego,
Opened once. After that it won't open. Just a blank white screen.,
Love the app but on the Lenovo TB-X606F tablet the 3D mode doesn't render the bricks right. Also the pdf instructions are zoomed in so much I dont like the view. For now I'm better off just using the paper instructions. Might work better on a phone but then that's smaller... Defeats the purpose.,
"Great instructions! Legos have come a LONG way since I had them as a kid. I wouldn't mind ordering a massive amount to build my home I'm designing. Anyway, Using the 3D option to help through the build process was AMAZING! I highly recommend using this option to build your next project with. Makes the build go so much smoother...in my opinion. Thank you LEGO team, for creating such an app. Now, what can you do about making them softer, so when you step on them, it doesn't hurt as much? LOL",
"Brilliant. Best idea ever. Can't rebuild that expensive set that you lost the instructions for? Resolved. Sharing a build with a friend or helping your kid and need to look ahead in the instructions? Here is your second copy. Phone screen too small to work from or don't want to leave your expensive tablet with the kids? It's a PDF; print it out and give them the papers. Brilliant. Thank you Lego, you peoples are awesome.",
I had problems in the last days with Lego Building Instructions app on Android. Sets disappeared from my collection. When I try to add a new set it disappears. I've tried on two devices and logged in with two different accounts. Same wrong behavior. I've reinstalled. No use. Same problems. Look at the last comments in gplay. Several users have the same problem. Please help,
"I bought LEGO, because I want my children to disconnect from computers. Instructions are available only via app (no PDF either), which brings them back in front of the screen. Bad business model. App crashes regularly, we were afraid that we could not build the item. The worst part is that my kids were disappointed, too. :(",
App looks great and is good fun. But how on earth 30min of use consumes about 2GB of data. Ended with massive bill when my wi fi stopped unexpectedly while kid been playing. Can't even set to work on wi fi only like most streaming platforms. Not happy 😒,
"Got this app so I could rebuild a bunch of sets from my childhood that are mixed up into our massive lego bin. Didnt find a single instruction i needed on here, took me less than 30 seconds to find booklets i was looking for in great definition online. Maybe this app is good for other things. But not what I was looking for in a ""lego building instructions app"".",
"The app is perfect for what it's designed for and even my 4 y/o can use it with ease for her sets. The only thing I wish is that I could add retired sets (that the PDFs are on the app) to my collection rather than having to find it everytime. Hopefully they will also add all sets to the app, as I can get PDFs for some from the lego website but not the app. Hopefully as they have already been digitised they should be easy to add to the app database eventually to add to people's collections.",
I love it it is the most amazing lego app of all-time,
"Easy to use, great 3d step by step guide ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍",
it is very useful and smart,
isn't it really just a fun and clever opportunity for you to learn about the world of today with all the interesting interactions taking place on the internet and The A.I. that lives inside it....lol,
"Downloaded the app thinking I would give it a try instead of using the booklet. What a waste of time. Hit start building, choose the first step, and the app force closes. Tried 3 times, same result each time. Great idea, lousy implementation. Will adjust my rating if it ever works.",
"Good app. Works as intended. However, i would prefer it on PC, because the phone screen is too small and it drains the battery really fast (set 60354).",
This is exactly what I have been looking for. I haven't noticed any missing sets (yet) but considering how old Lego is and how many diff sets have been released I'm not surprised as it could get too much for some phones. My Xiaomi Redmi runs it perfectly and I love the 3D system for some of the sets..I have noticed that some of the new sets have no pdf which is unfortunate but I'm sure u guys will get into that. My boys books have started falling apart due to age so this is amazing!,
"App won't log in. Have preexisting account but app login screen just loads, never progresses past login screen. However I still received an email stating my account had been logged into. ??? Also when attempting login, it asks if I want to use preexisting info, however it is not my info, it is an unknown account name. ??? Tried changing password (saw that suggested in other comment) and turned off VPN, changed nothing. Only able to log in using phone browser. Uninstalled app. (Galaxy S20 FE 5G)",
I'm absolutely thankful for these digital/visual instructions! It made building the set easy and enjoyable for me and my 4.5yr old son to build. Less frustration and arguing for us and easy for him to see where things go. This made me want to buy Lego in the future!,
"very rewarding in its own way. following the instruction booklet can be refreshing as well, but definitely give this a try. I think many use this method as to not destroy the plastic the instruction booklet comes in.",
"Not a bad app, The app has a good lot of instructions which is helpful but ive come across 2 things that have made me a bit disappointed. 1.Some instructions dont come up for example Star wars Vaders tie advanded (The old one) Doesnt come up when i scroll down the star wars category but atleast comes up when i search (Ive noticed all the ones that dont Pop up in there categorys dont have a picture when you search them instead its a grey box), And 2.the star wars rouge one set arnt there.",
"Outdated (doesn't have, for example, the Paris or London postcard sets), and pretty useless, except for as a means of downloading a pdf of a set's instruction booklet. Overall, a really low effort app on Lego's part.",
"I had over 30 kits in my collection but when I went to open the app to add a new kit. They were all gone, my avatar was changed and it said I didn't have an account. So I am done with this wonky app. Reply: I did have an account and it was several months ago I set it it up.",
I will echo other reviews here. Using Android 11 on Pixel 3- the search box doesn't load keyboard and the QR scans don't find anything. Only way is to browse the 100s of sets manually.. might as well use the website and find PDFs.,
"A VERY VERY GOOD APP, now based on my review why is it 5 stars wellits because #1 its very easy to find you're lego set manual (if u own it of course) and i was able to put back my lego star wars set back to perfection once more, #2 its very easy to find that set all you have to do it type the category and enter the set number its very good app And if u lost ur manual dont worry this app will make it easier",
For a first timer this was such a neat way to spend some time on a Lazy 🦥 Sunday afternoon. 💕 loved it you made it so easy for me where's the next one .,
"Forced use of screen; I bought Legos to AVOID the screens for my kid! EDIT: The comment from Lego System lowers my review rating. The solution is simple--include the printed instructions/guide with the Lego set. I pay for the set, I expect the printed instructions, on paper. I don't need to spend extra time and money to download and print the PDF.",
"Works pretty good, but I've had problems finding some of the older sets.",
"cool app, but when i log in, it NEVER SAVES and i have logged in like 20+ times and still it doesnt save. 2 stars. Reply to Dev: The sets arent the problem. they save just fine. its my account itself. my avatar and name just kind of 🫥 and the log in and sign up buttons just 😐. idk. uninstalled.",
"I would give this 5 stars, but there isn't a version of this app for Amazon's Kindle Fire devices. My young autistic son LOVES building and looking at all the instructions for different builds, but it's difficult to get access to them on the Fire tablet. I really want to encourage this so that he may decide to go into the more advanced learnings that Lego provides (coding, robotics, gadgets, etc.). Please consider making a version for Fire tablets! We're raising an architectural engineer!",
It makes it easier if your Lego set instruction booklet is folded and it won't unfold,
"hate it, give me an instruction book every time. If this is the way forward I won't be buying any more.",
"I finish so slowly, and I don't enjoy the time doing it because it takes 4 hours just to finish",
"I Like Lego since i got my First Lego The ""Penguin Slushy Van"" With Cost of 19.75$ and I downloaded this app after hours at SM Supermall! Thank you for Making Lego! I've been Watching Lego YouTubers! I Was obsessed of Lego! That's Why I Rate this app a Perfect 5/5!",
Really an excellent app for the instructions. Got my 4 year right into it!,
"if you were to lose the manual or you buy the model second hand this Web site is for you,very detailed and easy to follow and all in colour",
"I like to keep up with what I've bought. However, would love to have an area to list the ones I need",
"So amazing,I think that this is the most amazing app for building lego,I want you to improve it and make another app like it",
great set. my 5 1/2 yr old built this all on his own in about 2 hours.,
I lost the instructions on an old set and with this app I finally finished it 😁 10/10 would recommend,
Very useful app. Petty don't have parts scan opinion!,
"parts missing, Total waste of time and money.. avoid",
"its so good ,its like you dont have to even keep the books you can use this.",
Fantastic build. Really enjoyable. Looks great too.,
it is the best and I like how it shows like little shorts of them doing something it is so amazing,
App doesn't let me do anything keeps telling me to check my wifi and won't even try to load anything,
thats a great way of doing the set because the books seem weird to me at times,
"this app is VERY good for finding very old lego sets from for example: 1999,1987 or 2003.",
super user friendly and very nice to use when building with kids,
It's very useful for children's which are studying,
Had many problems with the app after the latest update. it was almost unusable which meant I gave it a 1-star review. I have since uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now it's back to being awesome. I'm waiting for the instructions for older sets to be added (especially 4 digit sets). I don't understand why they aren't in the app already when they're readily downloadable directly from Lego's website?!?,
"Got it thinking I could actually BUILD nope, it just steps for if you lost the paper. WHY. And on the ""building"" ones it is just a 3d picture that you can move around. Oh and the building? Doing anything just moves the picture",
"Very good app ,very handy ,just one problem you don't have all the themes . It is a real bummer I have been trying to restore some old Lego sets so I downloaded but your missing Lord of the rings, The hobbit ,Kingdoms and many more if you had all the themes I would give 5 stars but you couldn't get all theThemes",
This is excellent for people who don't have intrusions,
so nice to have an app with manuals,
So much harder than paper instructions. You have to constantly zoom in and out just to be able to read them. Relying in an app with no paper option was a horrible idea.,
We watched instructions for building the Ninjago Katana 4x4. It hangs at a certain point and will not proceed. We have tried this on 3 different devices so your program has a bug. I did not see anyway to report the problem in the program.,
"This is a great app, but it would be better if you could add retired sets to ""my collection"" rather than having to search for them each time or remember where you stored the physical manual.",
works well but the step by step is just a PDF. it could be a more interactive experience with zoom to the step. I would like to see a search for pieces inside the step by step in case some are extra.,
"Loved it, easy to follow instructions and no need to bring the paper book around. UX is great. Would say they should consider naming the app lego instructions so it's easy to find in menu and store.",
"Nice app, very well thought out. Please add the Lego BrickHeadz 40384 set to the app because it's missing.",
I love it I completed 5 lego in 3 hrs,
"It's not a bad app, infact it's a great app! While you say your adult but need to make a child account is sorta strange sence there are Adult fans of Lego but it's fine. Now if your expecting EVERY set ever your not gonna find them here, the furthest this goes is 2010 and is missing quite a few sets from the years. But it's not bad if your just getting ideas for your own builds, but if you want more verity/all the set I'd just go to the Lego website and download them there.",
I want a place I can keep track of ALL the sets my child owns. This app would be great if it allowed you to add any set to your collections but it doesn't. WHY??? Why not allow all sets to be added? Example set 3184. There is no option to allow you to add this to your collection. Why is this app limiting you to what you can add when it has the instructions on the app. Why turn this add feature off from certain sets? This makes zero sense to not have that feature on ALL of the sets that are there,
"Instructions are presented in such an inconvenient way, oh my... very sad... Why app uses pdf where instructions are visible only on part of the screen (rest of the screen is blank) and I have to zoom into each page after moving through instruction pages :( very annoying",
"This really helps me build my Mars Research Shuttle but if I try to zoom in or out, rotate the model, or if it rotates itself to show me where a piece goes, it goes invisible, so then I have to go back how many slides just to get it to be visible.",
Nice guide for children,
"as it says, it is the building instructions exactly as it is in the booklet so nothing overly wrong. I did possibly expect more from the digital version such as animated placing pieces together could have improved experience?",
This app is really slow and buggy. The cold start time is abysmal like 20 seconds. The app freezes every time I scan s QR code. I have to force quit and manually enter product number.,
"Thanks, just bought another Star Wars but with lots more pieces doing in stages instead all one night. Finish first one, will work on next one on Thursday. Suggestion, I have never seen a Lego set with NFL teams and one love to build some teams with stadiums so we can interchange the teams to look like they are playing against each other. My family has four different teams.",
"Good, a bit odd to navigate whilst looking for specific instructions and lets not forget the constant attempts to get you to buy more sets,,, Attention Lego if you literally sold all Lego sets for half of what you do I would have already spent thousands on Lego but since the unbelievable greed for pieces of plastic,,,, over my 45 year life I've probably only spent 200 it's that simple and I'm absolutely not the only one that's always felt ripped off by your company.",
Very good except it doesn't work very well with technic sets with scaling diagrams. Maybe an option for it to scale to your screen would be good.,
"Easy to follow. 3D models in instructions help with any confusion of piece placement. Wish we had this when I was a kid!! My daughters agree, the included instruction books are great, but this is way more builder friendly!",
"really helpful, and nice to have everything in one place!",
It's a good way to keep track of the sets you already have and want. Sometimes it's slow or glitchy. Giving 5 stars because I like Lego. -(LegoGirl),
Good app but it's useless when you need to go to a specific page of a long instructions book. It has no way of typing the page and hangs if you scroll to fast. LEGO! Please fix.,
"Like the idea of the app, and I use it to know what sets I have. But I'm running into a problems where some sets cannot found. I wish there was an area for us to note those set numbers, so it's all in one place.",
"Almost perfect instructions and easy to enlarge. Only issue is sometimes difficult to tell different colors, especially those darker ones.",
Absolute game changer when it comes to building Legos. you can look around the step you are on in the build like you can when building Nintendo Labo which takes out a lot of the confusion when building.,
"QR scanner just shows a black screen, had to install a separate QR scanner which sucks. My Sets needs a small thumbnail view as well, there's no easy way to see you whole collection. Maybe filtering on My Sets would be nice as well.",
"Honestly im rating this before i get the sets but i've been looking at the reviews and the fact lego cares enough to give people an app that helps them build their sets incase they cant understand the instructions or just straight up lost them is a 4 star right off the bat. Ill deffinitely update it to a 5 depending on my experience of course and will let lego themselves know if anything is missing, buggy, or just something i think would improve the overall experience for others!",
"Constant crashes. Can't get through a single part of the build without a crash. Not a set, just one small part, like building a minifig.",
"Great idea as I don't want my physical instructions taking up table space when building, but it causes my phone to vibrate every time I press the ""next instruction"" button. Too annoying to use and there appears to be no way to turn this off in the settings",
"Edit: it's not the app, it's the phone. My phone is old and can't run very many tiny details at once. I would like a low graphics mode for less powerful divices great app tho",
"Cool way to build... in some ways, better than the manuals. Disappointing when trying to add to my inventory and the set numbers aren't in the database.",
"My husband, my adult son, and myself, exchange Lego sets every Christmas. This is the first year I have discovered the app. Because of my birthyear it is requiring my to create a child's account. Aren't there other adults out there that wish to use the app for themselves. Feeling slightly embarrassed for playing with toys on Christmas.",
"Absolutely ridiculous that the physical lego set itself doesn't have instructions, and that I have to download an app. Then the first option it gives me for the set is the exact same copy of the instructions from the physical lego set that are how to download the digital instructions. Seriously? Just want the instructions for the kid to build the Legos, instead I'm wasting time with finding some digital version. And what if someone didn't have a way to get the digital instructions????? grrrrr!",
"Horrible user experience. Pictures are too small, instruction pages layout is not optimized for use on the smartphone in any way and looks like plain 1:1 copy of the booklet. Useless junk.",
Please please please put the instructions back in the box. One of the few things my kids do that don't require a screen. Now it requires a screen. Put the paper instructions back in the box! App works okay. Please make it easier and more obvious how to download the instructions as a PDF so I can print it out for my kids to use.,
"I would have loved this app as a kid! imagine being able to view the instructions for any model! miss paper, but it's nicely animated all the same.",
Cannot redeem insider points via this app,
Looking nothing like it does in the pics. I downloaded it for the building instructions to my technic set and it didn't have them. Scanning the qr code only added it to my collection with little more to do then browse other sets in the search feature. Completely pointless,
Just the soft copy of the instructions manual. That 3d mode shown in the demo video/trailer is nowhere. Good if you want to know which next set you should look for to further your collection.,
"This app has some potential, however, constantly crashes and doesn't save my previous location. Also, this app could benefit from a quicker way to scroll through hundreds of pages at a time rather than going step by step.",
"Downloaded this for 75192.. First, it takes Ages to get to page 320 where I was.. And while I'm building, the app crashes, and makes me do the scrolling to that page all over again!! Your better off just getting the pdf from the site.",
Its just so good it helps you bulid lego sets,
the app doesn't include instructions for every set as in there were only a few power miners and bionicle instructions but it is pretty easy to navigate and will probably be very useful if lego decides to stop making physical instructions,
The app's good but there's a lot of instructions missing. Like the sets that come in just a bag & are 10$. They aren't in the app. Nor the Lego Games. They were around at the time of 2011. I searched a Lego Game's set number & the app found no results. Also the oldest for the lego Ninjago sets is the season 2 sets. There's no season 1 sets of lego Ninjago. There's no sets from even 2000. Nor lower than that year. You need to update the app so it possesses older sets. Not just new ones. Could you,
"Online instructions are an excellent way to build. The ability to quickly change pages, to follow hands free and magnify trouble areas are all definite pluses.",
"Additional building instructions not included in boxes!!! Edit: oh okay I just missing something in my review. I meant that Builder contains additional instructions not included in boxes 😁 Which is useful and amazing, like Mighty dinosaur set, number 4",
"I really like this app, it's so practical because let's face it- people lose paper instructions all the time. Now, however, you will never lose your instructions ever again! I totally recommend this to anyone who loves lego like me. 😁",
Good app. 3D instructions look nice but animations are to long and makes building slower. And the NES set tells you to install the Lego Mario app for 3D instructions but the NES is not even mentioned in the Lego Mario app.,
This is a great app and the interactive instructions are really great! My child especially like the extra parts to be creative with the set to really make it his own.,
Very basic. Does not scan all the QR codes the their bags. It's actually so stupid to put the code on a transparent background and expect it to work everytime. The app does not recognise the stupid code. EXTREMELY annoyed.,
because it was entertaining all the kids,
"Some good game but one thing, can you make the instructions for the coming soon ones visible I'd you can, other wise that's grand, every thing is great, graphics, layout, and the books look so real",
I love this app.I'm 56 and just started collecting Legos again about 3 years ago. Now I have enough Legos to build just about anything I want. This app let's me build anything I want. I build sets I haven't bought yet and sets that have been retired.The only fault I've seen is that I think some sets are retired too soon.,
This app is perfect for finding any old or new instructions the only problem is that it doesn't show all instructions for example star wars rogue one sets and it sometimes dosent work and goes to my home screen but I love this app for what it can do,
"Instructions were perfect! It shows pictures of what pieces, how many of them and where they go. Super easy to understand! My son and I had a wonderful time putting the Minecraft coral piece together. Can't wait for our next one!",
Pretty good app. 😄Specially if you lose your instruction book you can enter the set number then you can build.😀=🏠 I don't think the app has auto play.😮? Definatly suitable for ages 6-8.🙇🙎The app description does match the app experience very well.😇😇😇 I💖this app a lot,
The app is really good. It has instructions for all kinds of lego set. However if it is a really old one you want be able to add it to your collection which I wish you could. Would be 5 stars if that was the case. Other than that great app and highly recommend it for lego fans.,
"I love this app so much! It is SUPER helpful, useful, and amazingly simple and organized! I use this app all the time to help figure out which pieces I am missing and to help me build sets that I don't have the instructions for.",
"Very useful but sometimes very laggy and out of sync, often have to come back to see it went back a few hundred pages and there is no way to fast forward...",
Scanned the instructions to get other instruction for the minecraft crafting box 3.0. When I try to open them the app crashes. I've uninstalled and re-downloaded and it still crashes.,
"After downloading the Lego Super Mario app with 3D instructions, this was a real disapointment. It's just a bunch of low resolution scans of the existing instructions. No way to manipulate the image, which is a real game changer in the other app. Come on Lego, it's 2021, don't advertise features that aren't there.",
Entering text in the search field is impossible. I tap there and no keyboard shows up. I can't even paste a set number into that field rendering this app completely useless to me.,
"love this app, I only wish it had a parts database that adds every part from every set you add to the app, then you'll have a comprehensive list of every part you own, and also suggestions for other sets you could build with those parts",
"So far works perfect for me, scanning codes, downloading PDFs, the kits I have that do have the live builds available look great. We originally had the Lego Life app and all our kits synced right up with this one.",
excellent app! especially the 3D directions. my 4 year old was able to build his Spidey Lego set (with some help of course) but truly it was a big help and easy to use!,
Trash as in doesn't even work,
Great to build lwgo sets that you list the instructions too,
I love it! No more kids loosing or tearing up instructions. To bad it doesn't have all instructions integrated. I had to go to the website and look in the archives for one. Mini sets also don't seem to be on there.,
"Ok this app is good. I just moved so I dont have all my lego instructions and I needed one for the ghostbusters gateway for lego dimensions. I found this app, and man is it good. I saw a review that said... you can't find anything, but really I found a lego dimensions instruction in no time flat. If I was able to find this then I could easily find other instructions for sets including my other lego sets like the golden dragon from ninjago in no time flat.",
This app worked perfectly until I made an account and now it just freezes every time I open it up. What's the point in creating an account if it's going to screw up the app entirely. I also have the most recent update installed so don't tell me that's the issue.,
When you move the pieces weird stuff happens,
"Great for finding instructions. I like that you can choose between 2 modes (pdf, 3d model) - at first this wasn't clear to me how to access different mode from the UI. Can't add some older instructions to my collection (i.e. sets 4708, 4709) :-(",
I think its cool that if you lose you're instructions book you could just download this app and build it or you could build one of the newer sets without having to buy the set for the book.,
The app is great to build those Legos which you lost the original instructions. I made a point about adding each Lego I ever bought to build them again with my son. The only downside is that it's slow and hangs occasionally.,
For the limited sets that are available it is good. Don't expect to find your set in the app. I have only been able to find 18 of the 30 odd kits we have bought for the kids over the last 4 years.,
Convoluted unnecessary maze to try and create the account and then wouldn't log in. I expected better things from this company. EDIT: Thanks for your reply. I have deleted the app and hopefully any details attached to it. I have upgraded my rating to 2 stars because you replied.,
Really like this and the ability to sit in front of my screen whilst assembling. The only thing preventing 5 stars is the fact that I can't change my avatar which is completely wrong for me.,
Works amazing just like it says,
"pretty good, main problems, can't look up set with product number, and 3d instructions are buggy, but great app if you lose the instructions, I rate it stepping on a 2x4 out of ten.",
"Battery killer app! This app cleared the battery on my phone and an entire external power bank within less than two hours! Also, not keen on teaching my kids to stare at the phone already at such a young age. I won't be using this app again!",
"Hay Lego, great app, this is going to be so help full reliving the excitement of building a specific set. Can i ask would it be possible to add a print feature to the PDF. My children don't own phones or tablets and it would be helpful to be able to print out the plans they are working on. Thanks Lego, much appreciated.",
This app is the greatest app in the world I really enjoy it I use it literally everyday. My son has like 3 totes full of LEGOs without instructions I just go through it and find what I want to build and I build it with the random pieces even if the instructions don't go to it or whatever Its been really amazing using this app is there is no ads the pop-up very five seconds or whatever not at all,
i like this because i have a large lego brick with legos in it and i can make so many builds on this.,
"The bags that came with the 90 years of lego box, some of them are numbered so we had no issue building them. There are other bags in the box which only have QR Codes on them. When scanning these they don't work? Would love some further help Thank you so much for the response",
"I had no idea this app existed. I just started using it. It's freaking amazing! Thank you Lego family. It's so cool to be able to look up schematics, and keep record of your build sets. I'm blown away. 10 points guys.",
"Waste of time. App crashes when loading instructions. (Yes, I do have the latest OS and lots of memory to spare. No, re-installing did not help.)",
"It is easy to follow. But would be better if older sets (for example sets from 2012) were also available, as it would help to bring more people to this app.",
"Hi, iv figured out my first problem. But now I have a new problem. There's some lego sets that arnt on there. I already have them built but I'm using the feature of adding lego sets that I own to my list thing. I would be happy to see more lego sets on the app. Also I can't scroll on part where you find what online lego set ti build (sry if that'd confusing) Other that that doing good 😊",
Great to be able to have instructions on one place and consign the paper ones to the loft. Lots of older and smaller sets are missing though.,
"Great app!! No sign up is needed to view instructions, either in a great interactive, 3D format, which is very kid-friendly, or a PDF. Give it a try- you won't regret it!!",
Ok I have to say this made building with my 5 year old way easier for him to do more of the build. I really liked the way it highlighted where the pieces go on each step. Highly recommend this app!!,
"PLEASE please please allow me some sort of function that shows I am an adult 😭😭 I appreciate having the barriers there for the safety of the children but can we find some way to check block [NOT a minor]. would be appreciated for your older fans who love to embrace the technology 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 other than that, great experience. cute visuals, solid 3d platform, appreciate the work.",
"You should allow addition of older sets(cant add from 2012 and probably older), and you should add option to make brick inventory based on my set collection. Its really easier to make some set from phone than to look for written instructions.",
so amazing makes building legos sooo fun!!,
"As a 13 year old with limited money who loves lego, i downloaded this game in hopes of being able to actually place the legos piece by piece. However i downloaded it and all that i got was being able to flip through every single step of the lego build. Basically just a big apl full of intruction manuals for lego sets you lost the instructions for.",
"When launching the app, there a pop-up window permanently saying no Internet connection while there is internet. It happened on both Android and IOS versions of the app.",
"Good to catalogue all the sets we have, however the keyboard doesn't work in the app, I'm unable to type to search for sets, and unable to use the in-app feedback form. I have a pixel 2 running Android 11.",
"The only one that has been a while back and forth to the right place to stay in the morning and evening of a new job and the other side of the most important thing is that the company. I'm sure that the new York times with Flight Flight Flight information online at Google Reader may not have the right thing, I have been the best way. The other side, but it was the only one that has",
"Manuals are nice, but where's the building? It's called Lego© Builder, so I wanna build. Virtually. I wanna build virtually. And I wanna build freely. Not bound by preconstructed sets. I wanna play with my Legos like I'm a child again, without the hazard of accidentally stepping on one",
"For such a well known quality product, the app and website is a let down. The app is clunky and poor to navigate. All my previous sets keep disappearing. I hope this app improves.",
"There is way too much nonsense in this app. We just want to build instructions, no videos, no talking, no music, no nonsense .... Next time, please just provide the instructions for each bag number.",
"To uninstall you have to go back k to play store and find the app again, you can't just uninstall from your settings for that reason I would give it 0 stars but can only go as low as one, other than that it was average to use",
really cool to be able to load manuals and not have to flip through them ruining the booklets or losing your place. like how it saves your place if you have to come back t it later also,
"found some random bags of Legos at a thrift store, started recognizing pieces and found the instructions on here. now I've got almost 3 complete sets built!",
Lego once said that it's not about the money but yet they charge for everything and at ridiculous amounts. Just like every company. It is about the money and nothing else. Hevean forbid they have a free app for kids.,
very helpful but could better search functionality,
"Great app for finding instructions online and keeping track of owned kits. Took 2 stars off due to the pixelated images, which look pretty terrible on my 10 inch tablet.",
"Bought a Mario Lego set for my son for Xmas, tiny paper book with only QR code for this app; no paper instructions!! Ive tried installing this app at least 10 times and all it does is restart. I even restarted my phone in hopes it would install! Keep paper instructions a thing!!! This APP IS GARBAGE!!!",
I like the idea of having an app with the building instructions but the pictures are very blurry and not worth the frustration of zooming in on every page.,
I absolutely love this app it keeps the screen bright to see what parts go where and the ability to ROTATE the 3D MODEL you are building to make sure you are putting your pieces in the right place... 🤯🤯🤯BRILLIANT,
"I've used this app before and my son loves to be able to look through what he's built, but I recently relogged in to save his sets and now my app is frozen. I've tried restarting and force closing, but it won't let me use the app at all. I can't even log out.",
"Personally, I think this app is a thousand times more useful than the normal instruction paper that come with the toy box, but the only thing is, I wish it comes with a 3D version for each Lego project",
The instructions are good. The page at the end that shows all the pieces is missing a piece. It looks like a 4x5 with pegs out the back ends.,
Why forced to update? Checks be version and locks previous one even with no internet. I wanted to fix a set I already has no need of new features or sets,
it is a good way of finding instructions for a lego instructions that were lost or if you had the peacea to build one you could look it up overall a very good product only downside is it can crash frequently.,
"I have yet to be able to log into my son's account. The app keeps crashing. When I can get the app to work, it is awesome and very interactive. Which proves helpful when I'm showing my son how to out the pieces together",
Awesome app! I gave this to my 7 year-old because he lost his manual for one of his big lego set and he managed to build his set entirely with in a few days. It can really come handy when you lose you're set name manuals and other stuff!,
Told me the wrong instructions and made me waste my time looking for 2 pieces that didn't exist with the set. Don't waste your time with this! Just use the regular paper instructions.,
"Sucks. My son got a 2 in 1 set and wants to build the other option. It tells us to use the app but every time we scan the QR code, the app force closes. Thanks for making a set that has only one set of instructions and digital instructions that aren't accessible. 👎",
"Works well, but uses up battery too quickly",
"Easy to instructions at least for a 32 yr old. My 4yr old was less helpful, but we had fun. The whale and shrimp had a few left over pieces which was good for imaginative play.",
"App was perfect until phone update. App won't let me log into my account, various bugs saying no internet connection while wifi or mobile data are on and kicking. Pity!",
"Everything is clear, simple and user friendly. The instructions are fun and in my opinion, better than the real life paper ones. It is also better for the planet when it is online!",
Sure helps when instructions get damaged. My grandkids like it.,
Easy to use. Looks exactly like the paper copies included w/ purchase. Great tool to help with rebuilds and minimize clutter.,
"fun and usefull app but still alot of work to be done, would be nice to have different list of set so you can create list of what you have and what you want.",
super easy to follow directions and super easy to go back and forth to see where pieces must go. love being able to rotate and resize the object being built.,
"Good for if you lost the booklets that came with a set, but otherwise useless. It doesn't give you other ideas if you have a set that has a lot of extra bricks.",
"was purchased for my son and is going to be returned. to be honest, I'm very disappointed in the public and lego. one, you support the fact that toys come with no instructions yet high prices. to think it was made overseas for pennies yet sold for the prices with no instructions. when one finds a simple toy that comes with one character for an outrageous price that don't have that many parts so its no more buying legos or supporting lego in any way. hopefully others read this and understand stop",
"Not totally complete, set-wise, and no option for adding individual bricks to inventory. Better than nothing, could be better.",
Really easy to follow and understand and the ability to use it on your phone is great! you can zoom in and make it easier to see those hard to see areas during the build.,
"Doesn't load instructions. It just hangs while seemingly trying to download, waiting half an hour on a fast WiFi connection still didn't help.",
It's laggy. It crashes. It freezes your whole device. The application does not remember where you were so you have to manually find your page when you resume building.,
Having the ability to spin the model around and better see what color the bricks are better is worth it. A very helpful well put together app.,
It would be great if also pdf instructions were available for this kind of lego sets (Lego Missions) to give parents a choice. - If I wanted my kid to spend time with interactive apps I would not be buying physical lego set in the first place.,
"Fail for me , I don't buy Lego for my kids to be sitting around watching a screen! Most parents buy it to give kids an activity that does involve Phones , Computers or consoles! The only reason I can give you 1 star is android won't let me give you -5 stars. Tried finding PDF instructions ended up with the one page , that was the same as in the box telling me to download the App.",
"Great app whenit works, but using it in my chrome book for my daughter with the 3d instructions. It seems to crash a lot when tapping the bag to open it. What's happened to make this happen as it never used to be like this?",
"Cool and all 3 stars because I'm not sure if its a bug or not the instructions it turn invisible the pice that your building more stars if not for this ""bug""",
10 \ 10 it's a fun game for kids like me today,
bro this app is amazing I did it 3d so u should install it,
Building Lego sets using instructions in technology is better.,
it would be great to have more languages available,
Great app but cant seem to add some sets. Lars Family Homestead Kitchen 40531 is missing,
laggy during some parts,
App freezes when trying to open any pdf or 3d,
I like the app but you have to restart it every time you went to post something. And everything is kid friendly it has to check the post before you post it and if it is not kid friendly it reject it.,
"The game is nice, but it spend more time than expected",
needs to include paper instructions,
The overall app is brilliant you can find retired sets as well but the app lags a little when you try opening the building instructions but still Lego is my favourite so I give a 5 stars 👍,
Great for young and old builders! The 3D builder is our favorite since it makes it easier for newer builders to follow along. Love this app!,
This is really a game changer 🤩,
This is an amazing app 👍,
i am really like it!,
"Very useful app! However, although I find many Technic models and their building instructions in the App, it is not possible to add them in my library, so that I can access them later. Why is this happening?",
"Seems better than some of the old reviews suggest. Startup seems unnecessarily long; splash screens are so '90s. Needs confirmation on the ""remove set"" button.",
Honestly I have sets from 1999 and I can't believe they have the instructions for em and it's makes it so much easier for me to rebuild my old collection,
"Great app, but should include every LEGO set not just a few from each theme. I understand that they go back for years but there are a few sets I have that aren't on the app.",
"Could be great......if any of the instruction booklets were actually available in the app! I only found a whopping 7 in the app whole having to download 20 from the website. This was before I completely gave up. Come on! These are DC, Marvel and Lego movie play sets and they aren't in the app? Useless.",
Really helpful to build a different one. Child liked it a lot. Enjoyed building it on his own. He is 7 year's old still able to do it and visual instructions are too good and enjoyable.,
Absolutely brilliant way to engage my young daughter - wish we had interactive instructions when I was younger! Great way to keep track of sets too :),
"Some sets are missing (30529). Would like a better view of our collection eg by type (city - artic or city - space, super heroes Marvel or DC) in tiles or subsectioms",
"In trying to build something as intricate as the Titanic, it's great to be able to zoom in on the pieces to make sure I have the right ones. It's also nice to have instructions that are portable and pocket-sized.",
Easily helped me to build my first ever Lego set. Thank you!,
"I like it, works great! Would like to see older instructions added to be able to build my old sets with my kids as well as their new ones.",
Good instructions. Still a little hard from a perspective angle. all instructions for every set should be 3D so you can rotate the image.,
Can't create an account crash's every time. Also had to manually add my daughter's set in. I like the ideas page was able to access both the book it came w and the online instructions.,
"I thought I could digitally build any set for fun, just a instructions manual for a lot of sets. Still cool. Just slightly disappointed.",
This set was extremely difficult to build. If done exactly per instructions the flowers clash on the various stems. I would still buy it again.,
"Worst app. Had it for about 5 seconds and realized it doesn't have instructions for retired sets. Silly me, thinking they would have thought of that. On top of that the stupid scanner is worthless. It wouldn't read any of my codes. Uninstalled. I wouldn't recommend this app. It's worthless.",
"The 3d mode is unusable in its current state the app is slow and the colours on the models are entirely different than the actual instructions, and the app has issues rendering models.",
This app is the goat of building apps. You guys have very good apps but you guy whent all out on this app. You guys are sold for this app😍😍😍,
"Fantastic tool, particularly when the kids draw all over or wet the instructions. Very beneficial to assist the kids with now archived sets which have been relocated/dismantled over the years.",
"Really cool app, no longer have to worry about losing instructions and all my sets are saved in one place!",
Neat if you're building together and want your own manual on your side of the table so you can work on multiple sections at once,
"Really useful on tablets, but does not work well on a smaller screen. I wish there was a method faster scrolling in pdf's, just like there is for 3D models.",
"App takes a long time to start up. Waited long enough to get to the main screen, but nothing there is responsive to touch.",
overlay issues from previous steps made certain steps hard to see and understand. 3d version. maybe the pdf is easier to use. ended up reverting to the booklet,
holy hell.....most amazing Lego app ever.,
Every 2 seconds it would bump us off the app and close it. My 4 year old cried every time. Would much rather use the instruction manual included in the set. This app sucks.,
Good App to log your Sets. I like the brick count. Would like it if you could customize your own name and picture though,
"Bad image quality. The idea of the app is awesome, but I was expecting that when zooming, the image quality was better than the real paper instructions, but unfortunately it's the opposite.",
"The app needs an option to NOT hide the soft keys, makes navigation through the app difficult. Older sets as well as several newer sets aren't listed.",
Set up very nice and very easy to use but unfortunately the instructions don't date back very far. Would be nice for Lego to work on digitizing sets from the 80s/90s as well,
"Keyboard won't open, so i can't search for a set. Camera never recogises the qr code either. Pixel 3a xl. The 3d instructions work well, though. Please fix the input issues! 🤦‍♂️",
"Loved the app as it tracked all my sets and had the instructions. It worked on 8/18/2020, but today none of my collection load. Uninstalled it and then reinstalled, but still no collection. Will have to track my sets another way as I have given up on this app.",
"For the most part it was good and easy to use but it keeps crashing now. My son uses it all the time because the regular instruction are hard for him, so pretty bummed it's crashing now.",
My 4 year old son has so much more fun following the instructions on this app versus the booklets included with the sets. I believe he also follows the instructions better too,
"The app crashes every time you click on the image of a model you want to build. Tried with both models from set 42118, app crashes every time.",
Scanned the code on the instruction book and a completely different set came up. Had to manually search for the correct one.,
A bit repetitive when you're doing the same little part multiple times (wheels and tyres etc.) but a really good way to build.,
"A good idea but frustrating implementation. The biggest issue is no ""jump to page"" function so to see the inventory I'm having to scroll 500 pages, then 500 pages back again!",
"What a great app! I built an Avengers set with my 5 year old son. He built the whole thing for the first time by himself, following the step by step instructions. Easy to use, easy to follow, and child friendly.",
"Got a Lego Mario kit for the kids. No paper instructions, just a QR code to the Lego Builder app.... and when you try to look up the set? A link to a specific Mario Lego builder app. Why couldn't the QR code bring me to the right place the first time??? Lego is usually very user-friendly so I was pretty shocked.",
I like you can build all the different themes it's great I can build and see all the parts and stuff on the instructions and the individual part numbers and the part colors too,
"Would be a 5* but it is only saving 6 build sets, would love to use this as an inventory apps as well, but understand it is what it is intended to be. Update 8/28/22: upgraded to 5*, currently am able to save 28 sets, thank you Lego Dev Team!",
Bad I can not make anything or buy anything bit it only sounds fun and attracts people that the game is awesome but when you install it all of the instructions are super hard and It is very hard to find the instructions of the lego let you have😐😐😐,
"This app is ridiculous and redundant. download 1 app, so it will direct you to download another. Is it not enough that I bought the product, and it didn't bring the instructions. Now I have to download 2 apps. Lego your ridiculous 🙄!",
"Best app on my phone, right now. I went from fussing around on YouTube, trying to make a handful of cute things, so being able to dial enchanting full world that I just had to adapt my existing Lego to. We have loved it.",
"I would rate it 5 stars if not for the missing manuals, coz there are some missing which I could find in Google but not in here, so I would really appreciate it if you could fix the problem of those missing manuals",
absolutely garbage. I remember why I deleted this app in the first place. Lego needs to drop this and just replace it with paper directions. I will not buy another Mario set because of this.,
"Maybe I don't get how this app works, but I don't see its purpose really - I can't search a set number, half of the QR codes I scan give me an error, and I can't make a collection of all my sets - so I have to keep the booklets after all to then scan the codes before I make a set? Seems pretty useless to me...",
"Nice app, but the instructions are the exact same as what comes in the sets, and for people that are colorblind, the muted greys that these instructions are are not helpful. Why can't the app have the exact colors of the pieces they represent so we can match them up easier?",
"Love it so far, but have a suggestion. Have a mode to show suggested builds you could make based off of your inventory that you've registered.",
I used to have this and yes it is very good I can't download it anymore it will not let me I have a cricket phone it's just not letting me don't know why it's just not please if someone knows how to get to the developers please show them this dragon so I can get all this stuff so I can actually not have to look at the manual that won't stop flipping over to the very beginning when I'm on page like 37,
I love the app. My toddler tends to rip up the instructions for the Duplo Legos. My 10 year old has so many lego sets that have gotten lost or thrown away . So he love to just look up what lego set he is wanting to build. Now one negative thing I have is that alot of older legos might not be found.,
"The app is great however I cannot type anything in to the manual search bar :( I have a pixel 3a. I click in the search bar and nothing happens, the keypad doesn't come up",
Zero stars. Your spp isn't even working... at all. Just a blank white screen. Tablet is updated. Uninstalled. Restarted tablet. Reinstalled app. Nothing. I guess I have to use the huge catalog instructions. Thanks.,
"This app is amazing! But I would really like there to be a way to add older sets to your collection. 🥺 This is the best and easiest to use collection app, but I can't add my Power Miner and other older sets to my collection.",
very helpful. sometimes gets colors mixed up (i.e. silver with light grey) it would be neat if other people could post instructions on their original creations if they wanted.,
"App worked until I logged into my account then it froze up completely. Now, everytime I log in it's frozen. Wasn't even able to properly use the app",
Nice complement to PDF instructions. Especially great to be able to rotate models in the instructions. Wish the interactive instructions were available for more models,
"This app is just set of PDF files with instructions. You can barely read them on small phone screen. But... You still need them, because the instructions are not included in Lego box as they used to be.",
"Very easy to use, quick adding the book with the QR is great so I don't have to worry about space for the larger books.",
Keeps crashing part way through a build. It then reloads up at an earlier part of the build so you have to find where you were.,
This is a great app that gives you step by step instructions to build lego sets. It shows 3-D images of the builds that you can zoom in and out of and rotate 360 degrees. A must have for lego enthusiasts or parents of lego enthusiasts.,
"Lot of unused potential - the idea is great, but the instructions PDF browsing experience kills the whole concept (e.g., hard to scroll/navigate to a concrete page). Ended up uninstalling the app and downloading the PDFs from Lego website",
the best part of this app is the 3D interactive build instructions. it is great to spin the build around to get a better perspective of where the blocks go.,
"Was very useful for my 5 year old to use, particularly after she spilled milk on the instruction booklet. The 3D instructions meant she could make it with little intervention from me. Thank you for this app, Lego!",
"Just displays the same images that are printed in the set. Does not even support device rotation, so landscape-oriented instructions are displayed as a tiny image in the center of a portrait-oriented app screen.",
it would be nice to be able to add retired sets to my collection. I'm an adult now rebuilding all my lego for a display and it kinda bummed me out to see I could only add newer sets to my collection.,
Great App - Missing Lego Set ☹️ My son loves to keep track of his accumulated Lego sets on this app. It's great to have access to digital instructions also. My son does have one Lego set we have just purchased (60244) that does not appear to be in the app though. Is there any way this can be amended?,
Awesome little set. brought me back to my childhood putting this Star Wars ATAT together. the app is cool with the page by page instructions. I will be buying more sets and would recommend to kids of all ages... including 45 year old kids like me.,
"Terrible app that consumes your battery & ruins your screen free time that lego used to be, the kids like to build the sets & then after a few days would use the pieces to design their own things, this time we didn't bother building the set at all, in future we will avoid buying sets without printed instructions, may start avoiding lego all together at this rate.",
Overall good but little sets aren't on there so can't include all my sets which is a bit disappointing. The instructions for these sets are on the website so can't see why they aren't in the app too.,
Completely unnecessary unless you have lost the instructions booklet. It's just low res scans of the book. Nothing more,
"It works, but is difficult to navigate and scans of instruction pages aren't a very good way to use a phone.",
could use a little more attention to details but all in all great!! finished my Apollo 11 Lunar Lander in a slow 4 hours. took a few breaks.,
The online instructions are excellent for ease of use and storage. The 3D views with some builds are a real nice touch. My children love it.,
"Very nice, even saves progress for bigger sets. Just careful of the X that is for closing pdf...occasionally overlaps instructions and can appear to be part of the instructions lol",
Great app for storing and finding instruction booklets all in one place. Does not have some of the older sets though.,
this is a great way to keep the instructions. a great idea by lego cause I'm always misplacing the paperwork. just kinda with some of the older kits were on here like from when I was a kid in the 80's and 90's,
It's a great app that makes it a bit easier to build my sets. I do wish that I could add retired sets to my collection so I wouldn't have to look them up everytime...,
Would have been 5 stars but the inability to add retired sets to my collection. There needs to be an option to add them to either a retired sets collection or just a option to add them in general just for ease of use.,
"App works great on my phone, however it crashes when I try to use it on my tablet. I can get it to search a set, but can't get beyond that.",
"Great for tracking your collection! Almost all new sets get added. Yet Brickheadz hasn't been updated for the last 40 sets, since the beginning of 2021. Only fix I wish for.",
"Lost your original building instructions or bought a used set without any? Wanna keep a digital inventory of your collection? For the casual hobbyist to the hardcore enthusiast, this app is for you!",
"Very good idea for the tech age. Cut back on the paper and less packaging and use this app for the instructions. Also good to use to swatt up on your next Lego project. Not sure if this will work on my lads Amazon fire 7 tablet, if it does brilliant :)",
"It's very useful for if you lose your instructions. But , I would like to be able to build the Lego sets directly on the app digitally.",
Simple app was working fine so makes it more frustrating that it now crashes constantly. Good job I kept all the paper copies!!!,
"I am looking for instructions for old sets, and for whatever reason, they are not available. I would think LEGO would make every set ever release available. Guess I was wrong.",
"Really helps visualize parts, placement and model. My child really loves being able to spin the parts too!",
Best App ever! Especially with a son who can't look after his books and looses them. Now we can build without worrying about anything except having the actual pieces 😁,
"Not up to Lego brand standard. The profile login functions do not work. When you select them nothing happens (nothing all at, not even an error message or annoying spinning circle). The app does not allow download of PDF instructions if the tablet is running in Samsung Kids mode. I'm not suggesting Lego is just for kids, but come on! I support Lego going paperless, but the app experience needs to be top quality, otherwise people will simply buy other brand ""blocks"" (with paper instructions).",
this is really good I suggest getting it as when you scan your construction instructions it's there for ever so if you loose or break your instructions you have an easy to use digital copy bravo!,
"Much more convenient than the manuals: occupies much less space, saves a lot of time on flipping the pages and lets inspect the joints from any angle",
"Got the Old Trafford set for my dad and was hoping the app will help him put it together easier. The QR code does not work, nor can I search the set. What's the point of asking me to install the app in the instructions...",
Keyboard doesn't pop up to enter the set ID code so if you lose the manual with the QR it's a pain finding instructions. Otherwise great app.,
"Very misleading. I assumed it was a builder for Lego letting you build Lego sets online and such, when in reality it is just a catalog to let you build your collection without actually building the different sets.",
It's very disappointing I can't add to the collection my child's old sets. I thought I can put away the paper instructions for good but it seems I still have to keep them at hand.,
"I got to recreate an old lego set that I had bits and pieces to, but had no idea how to rebuild! easy to navigate the app and find the instructions I needed!",
"I really like this app, however I have 3 classic sets and I can't seem to see all the instructions. I have a maximum of 3 sets of instructions on each set and can't scroll down to see others that I have seen load.",
Virtual Building. So helpful I cant skip a step. I love lego friends mostly and it helps more with lighting. So helpful install today! For a Better Building experience.,
"makes it easy, can blow up the image to see what pieces I need. scan the qr code and go, or look it up it's that way.",
"The worst concepts, materials, ideas and with this recent push is now a company to avoid. Brainwashing kids, not educating. The minutes I have installed this app the camera started making noises (taking photos/ trying to focus). I will consider this company a threat to everyone's privacy. Find alternatives. Opt in for activities instead of just ""abandoning"" your kids in a pile of garbage.",
I suggest you challenge those in charge of testing your apps. QR codes scan but do not load to instructions. My wife had a similar experience on iOS. Tried on different wireless APs and via 5g. Lego can do much better than this.,
Downloaded one app only to be forced to download another app. 30 minutes later and still no instructions. Very disappointed to have to download multiple apps just to get nowhere.,
"This app is very simple and easy to use, however it does not show some sets. I understand that there are too many sets to put into this app, however it seems that more popular sets today recieve the most attention.",
Its very easy to use but please... Please add more older sets! At least add sets from like 5 years! Although it would be amazing if you would add sets from 90s...,
"No where near as good as the booklets. Too many steps in most cases, and I can't get rid of the tactic feedback Let's hope Lego does not replace booklets with this rubbish.",
No building all it is pdf formats of different Lego sets can't even build the sets so it is a waste of time and space would definitely give 5 stars if you could actually build the sets instead of just flipping through a pdf book format,
"i wanted a lego app that would let me make my own ideas from scratch but this app only lets you ""build"" sets that lego sells. makes sense if you lost the original directions but pretty disappointing if you're looking to be creative.",
Perfect if you have a lot of sets and a small child. Easy to put pieces back without digging out the manual that you know you put somewhere you wouldn't forget.,
"Terrible app!!no paper or digital instructions for set 60355, tried on my iphone and android!!!! Digitalization is good for adults, please put back paper instructions !!!!! I do not want to use some devices when i play Lego with my son!!!",
This app is veryyyy useful because I have been able to build some of my old sets that I've lost the instructions to . Thanks so much for creating this app. although I do think you should have a list of what bricks you need to build something before you start building,
"Amazing being able to see Legos before being able to build them really helps out a lot, I'm not that great of a builder but when I see the plan before being able to build it makes it way simpler thank you LEGO",
Constantly saying I'm not connected to the internet and won't load anything. All my other apps work perfectly fine so it's not my internet that's for sure.,
"Exactly what I needed! Easy to find what you're looking for, you can add sets to your collection, remembers where you left off, excellent app!",
"Not working on Pixel 5A. I can't get past the ""when were you born"" question. App is not responding. Tried clearing cache, storage and force closing it multiple times.",
Keeps on crashing after activating ghost view. Total rubbish... It's impossible to change the settings now.,
"All around I find it a good app, however it serves no purpose for me. It's a shame that bionicle isnt included. I wanted to use it to rebuild my childhood collection. But, it doesnt surprise me that bionicle isnt in it.",
"A useful tool and the 3d build option really helps young builders. Annoyingly, the app keeps deleting already owned sets and does not seem to let you save more than 20?",
Missing a lot of sets. Literally has a QR code next to the instructions to scan and doesn't have the set in the data base. Rubbish.,
Downloaded the app for my kid so we can make the other version of his technic monster truck....it crashes every single time I open it. Makes 0 sense and now we can't build it.,
"My kids use it on their tablets and love it. They like to use it as a lego wishlist, so it would be cool to have an option to save things to a collection OR to a wishlist.",
App crashes phone and gets stuck on loading when reopend and crashes phone tell you clear the cash on the zfold 3 when app is open and phone gets unfolded other then that i like the app just need to be careful to not.... Brick 😏... My phone,
"The manual for set 10403 didn't work - click the pdf option & loading bar appears, then vanishes. That set doesn't have paper instructions for two models - you have to access the instructions online! Without the app, I can't make those models. Update: App crashed 5 times when trying to open instructions for hot-rod version of 42116. No paper instructions or PDF download option, so needed a poor-quality YouTube vid to build (which my kid can't follow unsupervised). Very disappointed with Lego.",
Considering that Lego forces you to use the app in order to build the kits you have now choice. The QR scanner is slow and the app crashes frequently,
"The 3d building assist app is superb, would absolutely recommend for complex builds so that you can see how pieces connect from different angles.",
"I usually really like this app but having bought a new Lego City Missions set it is not showing the interactive missions at all, just building instructions. Really disappointing",
For some reason the 3D mode was lost /disabled I. E. Not available after some duration of usage. It was fine originally but now I am only stuck with PDF instructions. Please advise. I already tried reinstalling,
Made my phone freeze at first but the developer reached out and it works fine now. Just have to make sure there's no apps running in the background. Thank you for making instructions available online for legos.,
"Carries a good inventory of various sets, however I wish it would add some minor ones as well as a few missing themes from Lego like Mars Mission.",
Love the idea would be nice if the app would work properly. With some howto's it crashes and shuts down or it just does not load tried on new new tablet and phone i hope it gets fixed otherwise i love it,
"The devs are responsive: fixed a bug after I emailed about it. Keep up the good work (i.e. add more sets, including the rare/promo ones).",
This app was great in heloing my 5 y o and I build out Lego sets. I love how you can zoom and also rotate the 3D models around. You can also move forwards and backwards.,
It is a really fun app to play with I enjoy it a lot but it does take a long time to load and the animation isn't the best those are my only problems with this app but for everything else amazing the best,
this is my first time using this app and it was awesome I went back and forth from my camera to the directions with no problem to take pictures at different stages to send to the person who bought me the set.,
"I don't know if there was a recent update but, there is no longer a button that reads ""build set"". I can look at my sets but cannot open any instructions.",
overall it will take more time to do the instructions on this app then it was on the paper but I got a mission set and that was really fun would recommend if you have the mission sets but otherwise I wouldn't really,
Great instruction UI easy for little ones to follow. App is responsive and the zoom functionality whilst building is very useful,
"I have 2 star wars builds the falcon and Star Destroyer each with over 7500 pcs so nice to be able to zoom in , but would recommend have some type of login to save the page I had to always type the model number in and flip the pages to where I left off other the that 5 stars 🌟 🤩 😊 😀 😄",
I bought my son 4 Lego sets for Christmas. He is 5 years old and the 3rd generation Lego builder. I downloaded the app but it's not picking up the Lego Brand Store 40528 up when trying to search. He refuses to build without the set instructions on the phone. Please assist.,
I am logged into my account and when I try to save sets that I own the app will show them in my collection but when I reload the page the added set or sets I just added dissapears. This is a new behavior. Please fix!,
"I have only used the app for about a half hour and I am loving this app! It was exactly what i didn't ask for but definitely needed. It may not be updated blasters, but it's a close run up!",
I like the app but instructions plus is really confusing I would like it if I could see the peice I am building on. also I have this police station set I got it like five or six years ago and it doesn't seem to be on there.,
"Not really that necessary especially if you have the physical instructions, but also there is the website called ""brickinstructions"" so yeah, also why is there no bionicle tribute page I know bionicle is a retired theme but still bionicle is like the lego theme that saved lego also it's just a great lego theme in general even if it didn't save lego and also this year is bionicle's 20th year anniversary and lego just doesn't do anything for that, I'm sorry this was such a long review, I'm bored.",
"Not supported on Kindle Tablets, required for some sets. Just pack paper instructions with all sets and don't force screen time into play time.",
Quality of this app is very poor. Is fine to have all lego instructions in one app but it can be more interactive and logical. I am not happy with necessity to create my child account and forced to use this app by my lego package (missing instructions in package),
this app helps you build Legos. some sets have instructions plus which allows you to view in 3D. and in instructions plus sometimes it will give you a pop-up that says rate this set that might win you a cool prize!,
Usefull. I like this app because I can store all my lego manuals in the app and if I break them I wouldn't have to worry if I lost the manual and the 3D mode for the new Legos us good so I can have a detailed look of what I'm building.,
I really needed this app! I lost all my lego building booklets and was hoping that Lego would make an online app or something regarding this. It's been years and I kinda wanna get back making my large lego collections! Thanks again! This is great!,
Wish I could take pictures of the Lego and it shows diagrams of what you can build with them. Kids lose Lego so we don't have complete sets. This would be fun to help them.,
I should not be required to download an app and give Lego access to anything just to build a Lego set. I will not be buying any more sets that don't have printed instructions included.,
The instructions are extremely slow to open. It needs much more instructions. It is even missing some recent instructions.,

It's an amazing app tip:-on the old sets you can search the numbers instead of scanning the qr code it's nice to really be abel to build old set I lost the manual to!,
"viewer is slow and no easy way to jump to a specific page, but otherwise adequate.",
"Hi , great app. I would like to have size of modles inside the app as well. as we all know , lego is better kept in box than build( because of the size :)) keep up the good work",
"Not able to add Lego set to my account. When I click the +, it looks like it is adding to the account, but when I click my library, the set is not there",
Love this because I can see new sets coming out and I can rebuild sets that I don't have the instructions for. I also think this will help younger builders grow their strengths. My dream is to work at Lego and the has helped me alot,
Very poor experience. App is often unresponsive to touch. Searching takes long. Issues with logging in.,
"3d instructions just completely dissappear when try to turn them, I spent hours trying to get it to work, ended up having to use the 2d one's.",
"The thing this game needs is that it should just be where you build it on the device,like you could just get the lego set because you wouldn't have all the pieces so there's basically no point of this app because you have the lego set in real life you could just use the instructions that come with the lego set",
"The app is great. But why am I supposed to download the app for building the second version of airplane? I'm sure, it's not expensive for Lego to make a second paper instruction",
"💗😍😘💖💗💟💯This app is so damn cool. since am in a poor developed country , when you buy lego's most of them dont come with instuctons:(. But there is hope!!!! Becouse of you guys i can build as much lego's as i want with out struggling. thanks to your creative mind i can buy many lego´s without sweating or suffering to build. Oops am i typing to much? Your app is realy just sooo freaking amazing!!!!@@@",
"Very useful. Unfortunately it doesn't give directions for older sets, pre 2008 I believe but anything newer its definitely useful. I use it instead of the actual paper instructions",
"Some instructions are missing. 42100 instructions are in 2 massive books, but only book one is on the app. The instructions for the bucket wheel excavator 42055 are missing from the app too. 42100, only one book appears.",
"Appalling & Disappointing! Having downloaded this for my son every time he scans a QR code nothing loads, then when we try to search by name or lego number, after 5 seconds we get told we have no Internet connection when we do. What an utterly useless and clearly poorly supported app, that has left my son and I sorely disappointed. With the money these kits cost you'd imagine ,ore effort would have been made to upkeep the app properly!",
This app is the best. I lost lots of my manuals and I was miserable. I saw the app and saw the ratings on the app and thought to download it since then I've been so happy because I can I build all my lego LEGO and they don't have all the manuals but it was fine,
"Doesn't match my paper instruction, not even the same parts. Opened a case with support and they said the paper ones were wrong, but I don't even have the parts to do it.",
What a great idea! Puts the instructions on your phone/tablet to make following the instructions easier to navigate! I love how the provided QR codes on the box AND bag of LEGO take you right to your particular kit.,
"I like this app very much as it has almost all of the lego series like:Ninjago,Minecraft,Lego friends,Nexo Knights,you name it and it will be there!! But in some of the series only some sets are there.Like if 1 series has all the sets that ever was made for that perticular series only half of it is there.I hope they have an update and include all of them",
"it's a pretty perfect app, giving you access to any lego set recently (2013 on) released. saves progress and you can even inventory your collection",
"I like the idea of 3D instructions, they are just a bit slow, you have to click 100 times to complete small set.",
helpful for those really hard to read instructions on Boxes advent calendar sets. as well as building and noting what sets you have I recommend this app completely.,
"this is amazing! really like how it's practically like your building the set, and how it keeps track of sets you build on it that's why everyone should download it!",
The best game stories ever put it on there but it's like a three-set like a visit a free set Lego set it is and it only has two car instructions then you would need this app and I would say this app would be a go-to she says and supper some of the ways you guys programmed it is,
Really good fun to use along side the instruction book when building with your child and stops the dreaded double page skip that leaves out a build stage! 🙈🙉🙊,
It's a helpful app but it runs a little slow and seems to be missing some of the newer sets like 75276 and 40407.,
"It is a really good app, but I've given it 4 stars because its missing some sets. I got the app because I needed instructions for the Star Wars buildable figures, but the Imperial Death Trooper, Commander Gynn Erso and a couple more aren't on the app. Please fix this if possible",
"Cool app but not all models availabe and. It's really hard to open specific page on instructions, need to swipe through the pages, there's no way to enter a specific page to be opened",
This app is absolutely amazing. My 6 year old is able to use it and build legos with no help from me!!!! My only wish is that it was compatible with the amazon fire tablets.,
"Good app overall, but there are many sets missing from the catalogue, and the app could use more features such as seeing your total amount of bricks",
"Sadly older sets cannot be added (no plus button), e.g. 6242. Scrolling through instructions is laggy on older tablets (no rewind button).",
"I like this app so much and I think is really fun and cool. And it's completely safe!!! I have a question though: When you add a set it gives you some bricks, what are those for. Thankyou",
Keep crashing. Add lego set in profile but the profile do not save them in the list. Could add different build with combined sets.,
this is the worst thing you could have done for Legos the idea of Legos is not to download app and scan qr codes its about creating not another classic product ruined by technology you guys sucks just trying to build a Mario lego set and you couldn't just put the instructions book in the box like it has been done sense the beginning of lefo time,
"This is so cool! If you scan the qr code it can help you build your set AND you can zoom in on the piece that you thought was wrong but not actually, SO COOL",
"Amazing app to keep track of your Legos sets, I notice that they are uploading older sets as well, but so far almost all 90' sets are missing Keep up the good work! thank you",
Love this app easy to see steps and follow Keeps track of what step your at to easily continue your build But I have found that it doesn't have all sets - especially special seasonal releases,
Do not use this app. Takes too long to set up and doesn't provide help. It's a useless app. Shows the same as your user guide. Frustrated I waisted my time on this.,
it's great when you need the information how to build the legos you have step by step pages easy to understand.Right at your fingertips.even when you want to build a different lego with the same pieces.,
"Doesn't work. It won't read the QR from the instruction booklet, so I tried to find the set manually in their search but it's not there. Garbage.",
"Am i the only one who is unable to enter numbers into search box to look for instructions? I click in search box and my keyboard does not pop up, so i am unable to search for anything. 😯",
very useful if you lose the booklets for a set and need to rebuild. Only a few sets have 3d options.,
"I give it a 4 stars because it was good for like 2/3 days when it stopped working, I would go on the app and all I can see is white I tried Deleting it and Downloading it again and that doesn't work can you try fix it thanks :)",
Improved my rating because it's a program in progress. Also I really appreciate how quickly the creators responded. Will keep it to see where it goes. 🙂,
"QR scanner did not register my set. Could not type it into search as onscreen keyboard did not appear. Pixel3, Android 11.",
This app assumes I'm French speaking. No way to change the language setting when first starting the app when it asks for my age. I do not like being addressed in French. Uninstalled.,
There are no options for making a lego without the original part. Because I don't have the lego sets which I have few parts from each lego. But can't make the building without the set. If u make a page like making lego with the sets we don't have or create in our imagination,
"Good for B model instructions. Resolution of images could be a higher, as when you zoom it's a bit blurry.",
"Some of the images don't load ..showing only exclamation marks, despite high bandwidth. Easier to use the book.",
"Keeps crashing closing chromebook. So when then open the app again, its back in the beggining of the tutorial.",
Great app ever because for Lego Lovers and you can see listen to one and make sure this set is good really good it's not good and from this app Lego head to scare little of Lego 2because there are so many picture of Lego sets and cool modulus like technique friends Disney Ninjago City and more from my optional I love this app,
"not very helpful 😕 I already have the booklet but if the peices look similar the book isn't always helpful and if the peice won't fit,how can you see what you've done wrong, it's not 3 dimensions",
super helpful especially for those with kids who aren't super careful about handing on to Lego instruction books once they put the set together the first time! this is a great idea,
brilliant app for when the nephew starts breaking stuff up and then wants the original spec again... talk about taking privileges 😉 handy for most sets... me and the nephew are starting with the lego city set and has every single one we have so far.,
Fun and engaging enough for an instructions manual app. I can see kids enjoying this as they build their sets. Decently entertaining for adults too... tho they'll mostly appreciate no papercuts and less page flipping.,
"Can't find the right design that matches my Lego set. Totally useless. Instructions have no words too. Just pictures, hard to understand. I wouldn't recommend people to install this useless app 😑👎😡",
This is the worst way possible to get lego instructions. I can not even get instructions. It just shows the same paper that came in the box. No instructions,
"This is the app of my dream. I can have all my building manuals in a single place, with a bill of materials, 3D viewing to check placement.",
"Hi, Love the app! Some sets I can search for and find, but not add to my collection. Examples are Maersk Triple E liner 10241 and avengers quinjet city chase. Can you help out?",
It a very helpful app. Especially if you have cats that like to lay on your paper directions as you try to build. LOL,
Very good app no ads and if you cant find your lego book/instructions this is helpful. Keep up the good work! It will be more helpful if u can update it. Btw very good app!,
"Barely works :( Images dont load properly, impossible to use 3d which started as a great experience for the kids really clear, really really disappointed, tried removing and reinstall (Lenovo M8)",
"Keeps crashing - I love this app for building sets with my son, but lately it just keeps crashing and immediately sending me back to my homescreen.",
3D mode stopped working after last update. Very disappointed. Worked perfect and the phone is not even 1 year old,
"All I wanted to do is help my son build the lego set so he can play. when I have to download an app to do so is a major problem. if you want to have an app to expand the play is find, but to need it to build the set is ridiculous.",
"How a 6 year old child is supposed to use instructions in an app? Why do I have to be forced to offer him phone or tablet in order to build his set of Lego? I am trying to keep him away from unwanted phone experience and teach him that he can live without it, but Lego is forcing him into it. Wrong choices 😕",
"its just a lil wierd. it does save my instructions from being bent or used, keeps my stuff nice ya know. but sometimes a piece might be missing from a pic or the color might not be so obvious.",
"great app, wonderful replacement for a bog standard pdf viewer, also handy for keeping a track of your collection.",
"I've just updated this app on the 17th January 2023 and it doesn't work now, it won't load in all I get is a white screen and nothing else. Please fix this app",
Awesome kit. I would prefer to have been able to make both minions instead of pulling one apart.,
It gets interesting when you start. The instructions are very clear.. If you want use the digital app.,
"Very helpful, wife knocked one off a shelf and into quite a few pieces, couldn't find my instructions, downloaded the app and had it back together in minutes, definitely recommend this app for LEGO fans",
"Great app. I love to see list of my Lego collection, and see how much bricks I have. Now I can check before I buy a set, and know if I already bought it before (about 200 sets, I really can't remember them all...)",
Incredible build experience. Instructions are clear and concise. Final model is amazing and full of intricate details. Recommend to any Lego or star wars fans,
"Amazing! It's able to look up old kits, missing kits and alternative builds in the fly.",
"Good for record keeping. However, missing sets pieces. Here is what I found not yet added to this app: 40382, 40384, 40348, 40420, 40460, 40499, 40516, 40523, 40565, 40573, 40575, 40580, 40582, 66708, 66706, 852998. Note: these are brand new sets that should have been already added. Not looking for instructions, but to catalog these sets.",
"It does everything in the advertisement, but what I think is misleading is it doesn't tell you that ONLY THE KIDS SETS ARE IN 3D, So if want 3D instructions on thing's like Technic, than your SOL buddy.",
it is kind of tedious to have to zoom in and out constantly. each page comes up rather small.,
"Works great for finding instructions! some instructions hard to read on phone but just as hard with manuals, e.g. Lego architecture with black background!",
Could not get this app to work on any of our four Android devices. This is unfortunate because now we will have to make sure the sets have instructions before we purchase.,
"just a little helping hand when you need it. you could just leave you super cool kid constructing using the manual, and be a mega awesome guru with all the electronic answers, for when the rug-rat-nurf-hearder comes a crying for assistance 😎🤳",
Epic game if you lost your paper for the lego great app if you had lost it I'm a big fan of lego I have so many of them some lost its paper to build it but not it's not due to this app making it Epic I wish you a good and healthy and stay safe :),
Downloaded for 3D instructions for my son but NONE of the Minecraft sets are 3D. Shame because it could/should be an amazing app. What's there is good but needs a lot more 3D instructions as I can't find any.,
"Love legs, love building ,so do my kids so it's nice to see lego has created an app that let's us build old sets with the few tons of the stuff I've collected over the years.",
"Dude, the fact that you can zoom and turn the image around to get a better look at where the pieces are going is the best!",
"I can finally build my old sets again! 1 nit pick, doesn't have all sets and not all can be added to your profile but otherwise it's perfect!",
Brilliant! 3D instructions that spell out what you need to do; clearly enough for a child younger than recommended age to follow.,
I've found this retired set I've owned but I lost the instructions for the autumn and summer versions of the house. How convenient this is!,
"saves the wear and tear on the paper book, but doesn't always close like it should, causing a forced reboot. I still choose to use it.",
"I Wish we could have a LEGO builder that where we can build on our phones, like making our LEGO City seeing peop go there and car's even people on job or trains movee when you have built the train roads. And seeing LEGO Animals move and having fun. Making your own LEGO City or World your imagination.",
"i would love if you add older Lego sets, allow upload scanned instructions, and mark the sets you own regardless if are retired or no instructions available. in general allow more crowdsourcing.",
"The app is average at best, I had a few troubles with the app freezing ever know and again. Hopefully they support old sets on the app.",
"The app requires dumb math questions for no reason, and the app doesn't save sets you've completed. The app requires you to create a child's profile even when you are not a child. Terrible.",
"Apps is ok and fun to use, but no instructions on some newer sets. Zero explanation as to why, although I'm guessing that they are still being added to the app. At least I hope...",
This will come in handy for me because I lost a few instruction manuals so I can re-do / fix them. I will definitely use (when getting a new set on Christmas hopefully),
"Love the app. Latley, it's been lagging, freezing, and crashing the system UI.",
"This App is like the ""Hotel California"". One you are in, you can never leave. No navigation to exit. Very annoying.",
It's a good app I love it Lego is my favorite thing to play with you can build the same lego over and over as many times as you want it has cool legos you can even scan the qr code on the lego instructions book its pretty cool I highly recommend this app,
Constantly crashes. Can't even open instructions. Pixel 4a. Would give 0 stars but that's not an option. Wow unfortunate since the entire family loves Legos.,
App constantly crashing. My son can't build his set at all as it is set 60355 where the instructions are only avaliable via the app. Don't buy the lego story sets which require using this app.,
Keeps kicking me out of the app and tells me the app has failed to load instructions. It's really hard to help build something when I can't load instructions!,
"Was really enjoying this app until the PDF button vanished from all sets. remove set from my list and readd it, force stop the app, reinstall the app, nothing has helped...",
the speed champion instructions were the exact same thing as the paper instructions that came with the box. I wanted a video for a certain step that was unclear in the instructions,
"I just ran into a set that has three different greens, and they didn't even try to add better indication of which greens to use (I'm talking about the Lego Minecraft BigFig Ocelot & Creeper set).",
"I havent really used it yet. I was going to use it for instructions on the mixels, but there arent any. Please add them, they are my favorite sets.",
"This is AMAZING! Especially the new 2023 instructions that are 3D! You can rotate, zoom in on the instructions and even better on a tablet!",
"I hope in a future update, the app will allow you to add older retired sets into your library. Otherwise the app is very useful.",
This was a very helpful way to build Lego sets. You can move the pieces around in 3D setting and feel confident that your putting the set together right 😀,
Great app! Started selecting my sets only to realise I can't add all my sets that are now retired. Don't see the point in carrying on with it now.,
I have been wanting something like this for such a long time so that I don't have to hold on to all of my old instructions/can rebuild the ones I lost the instructions for so long ago!,
"Well done app, with room for improvement. Could simple hyperlinks when instructions reference a page number be useful for some sets? We're working on BrickHeads Go Brick Me (41597) this morning where it certainly would be!",
"Helping to build and rebuild my kids lego, especially because most of the books teared up and the collections just mixed up. It also help to find new reference products that might suitable for you kids.",
"The option to pick up instructions for these sets should be available at the counter during purchase for people who don't think kids this age should be using iPads and Android devices, Lego was my escape from these things, the fact I needed to download an app just so my son could effectively use your product was a poor corporate decision and may change my decision to buy your products in the future",
After like 2 or 5 minutes I couldn't even tap anything it just wouldn't work. Even though I think this is a good game it's just so buggy.,
I like this alot. But it doesnt have all the sets and genres but its cool. I like getting sets and scaning them to my list. And i have added my older sets to my list. It needs the lotr and the lone ranger sets,
It's really helpful! I don't have many Lego sets and this helped by giving me the instructions to almost every Lego set. Mega worth downloading.😃😃😃,
Extremely aggravating that I cant figure out how to change my account name or avatar. Can't find anything online with steps on how to make modifications. Can't even tell if it is tied to regular Lego website online VIP account.,
"Horrible, I already have the instruction of how to assemble the set I bought, in this case Lego Technic 42096 (Porsche 911 RSR) and it's a mess cause there's 11 different bags, different sizes and parts of all shapes, so I'll have to open all the bags and go ""fishing"" for the ones I need at the moment even used the QR scanner",
"It's really good as it gives you an alternative moc, 3D instructions, pdf file, and more. And also if it's on sale or not. (BTW retired means no on sale)",
This app help you better than the instructions this app is cooler than any other building app I can see that you can make it account too you can build Lego Mario's anything else to it's very cool but I was doing under Legos was on this app you can build just wanted to tell you,
Best app for construction!!! I recently brought a minecraft set and downloaded this app to go with it and its been helping me so much. The best part is that there is absolutely NO ADS!!! Thanks for making this app. It deserves a 5.0.,
for the sets with 3d instructions this is awesome. even for ones without its great to have all of the directions in one place,
Easier to scroll through the pages than the paper instructions and can be on as big and bright a screen as you'd like.,
Waiting a long time for an app like this. It's perfect if you have millions of Lego pieces lying around and can save you a lot of money by just building it from scratch at your house!,
Im rating it this know because I got some great customer service but my app is still not working so can you get in touch with me on Gmail it's still want let me register and won't let me build my set from 2021section,
"The 3d instructions through the app were very, easy to understand, visually descriptive, manageable, straightforward and practical.",
"it is good, it helped me and my sis work on the same Lego at the same time with different instructions. but I don't think that it should need a email address that's what put me off.",
Only useful for new lego sets. I have a lot of old sets that i no longer have the books for. Would be cool to use this on those.,
No Bionicle G1 instructions? In fact there's barely any instructions for old sets at all. Isn't that the idea? To get digital instructions if you lost the old ones?,
"The app is so large I have had to delete all others apps on my son's tablet to use it. Please consider a pdf view only, smaller app that's appropriate for a child's tablet.",
"details are to small on a phone, I cant really make out how many I need of some pieces. I'm sure it will be great to have as a backups though.",
used this app for my very first set and i am very glad this app exist because the manuel looks wayy more complicated. but im sure its just as easy but this app helped me all the way through so gotta give it 5 stars.,
I love that it has the ability to store what sets I own. Makes it easier when purchasing new ones (too many to remember),
"This was a very fun set! (lego City recreation vehicle) I had to correct a few mistakes my son made dude to unclear instructions, but,we had fun!",
"Pretty nice, wish I could get something special for using the scan code. Just saying nothing beats free stuff. Especially when one pays so much for something so simple.",
Half the instructions that say scan for instructions plus do not exist or the QR code just does does work. And when you enter the set number into the search bar it tells you that the instructions don't exist or can only be downloaded as a pdf.,
Such a great set! My son is enjoying it immensely!! a little long to put together but download the Lego instructions app it's a time saver!!!,
"I love this app, but suddenly I can't type anything in the search field and can only add stuff via the qrcode scanning. If the searching is fixed I would give this 5 stars.",
just put the instructions in the box of Lego. this is to get kids away from screens but you are forcing kids right back to screens. I guess less Lego will be purchased moving forward.,
"""This is fun"" said with a big smile for my 5 year old son. He loved building his Lego Classic Ocean Fun. Then the real imagination creations began with all the extra pieces. Lego is truly a multi generation legacy. Thankyou Lego",
Great idea but I'm old school these weren't around when I was young so instruction booklet for me! 45 years and buying Lego still so what I liked I bought it then I'll build it,
App does not help with building instructions has the button for start building on Hedwig for harry potter but not Fawkes for harry potter and I also created an account and no button to start building something is wrong with the app please fix very frustrating for it trying to be easier for some people please update app to add instructions for every structure even without an account,
"Frustrating I am an adult with disabilities and the app, despite putting in my date of birth, keeps treating me like I am a child and making me do math problems for security reasons, math is my worse subject I can not do math at all, this app is for kids and not adults unfortunately, although lego os for all ages, doesn't make sense.",
Every time I scan a qr code for hidden side it brings me her probably because I have a Android Xiaomi. Could you please make hidden side for more Android's? Sorry I have to do it here because I can't download hidden side to do a review. it's very sad that it doesn't work because I was very excited for to use it.,
being cheap on printing instructions and not even explaining the full construction steps in the app. You end up with unfinished project and wondering why this lack of quality.,
Unfortunately 35% of my library isn't on here. I hope they keep updating the backlog. Even some new sets aren't on there.,
found instructions for building old sets for my childhood by typing model number into search bar. the new set instructions are every inactive and helpful for new builders.,
"What I expected: being able to build your own object and making it as instructions, but no! In reality, you can't?! That's a huge upset on me, so maybe you could add that option for everyone sometime?",
"pictures aren't always clear how a branch attaches, but I figured it out. (ie the 3 duplicate branches attach to trunks by the gray post not shown)",
"it's nice to not have to handle my instruction books when building and trying to keep my sets in a collectible though opened state, and also helpful to keep track of my collection progress",
so sad to see cost cutting here and asking kids to use instructions on the phone (pdf!) instead of providing printed ones. really bad direction for such an amazing company and great toys,
I think this is an amaazing app because it is easier to read and understand than the normal instructions and it opens up to the place where you left it,
This is awsome i was able to build my ghost rider set with the app because i never built it and lost my instructions so this helped and my lego city sets this app is awsome.download no regret it helps huge!!!!!,
Gives you additional builds that are not included in regular build manuel!!! Great for when you lose instructions but have the box(lego number)!,
Does not work I bit the insiders program socks!,
"Hello , every time I try to install this it asks me to delete apps. I have no apps on this device. I just reset it. I'm on a galaxy tab 4 a Please advise, thanks",
I say 4 stars bc It would be a lot better to be able to build the Lego sets other than just seeing instructions. But that is just my opinion,
"Good app but runs horribly on older phones and tablets, which is what my kids normally use. I usually end up getting the PDFs from the Lego website instead.",
Why did the alternative builds disappeared? At least on the sets that had it. I was hoping to see more of those. That was the real magic of this app.,
"Great, theres no bugs, no major problems, and you can collect sets digitally, i would recommend this!",
"Overall the app is fantastic, just wish that there were more of the sets on here. If ALL lego sets were added it would be AWESOME.",
"It was a great app but for some reason keeps removing sets that I have added to my collection. 42 sets removed not by me, added them again, then the app removed them AGAIN!",
"garbage, I have to install an app, instead of just printing out a booklet. lazy business practice and inconvenient.",
"An idea, add a free build mode so you can try building your creation on the app and if it works then the customer will know that if they get it they can waste not a single cent on pieces",
"Great app, but my one improvement would be the ability to bookmark where I am up to in build instructions so I don't have to scroll through pages to get where I'm up to",
some bad angles which make it difficult. how about a dwg viewer or some sort of interactive 3D rather than a PDF.,
All the 3d instructions crash the app. Also make this application not be dependent on internet. There are people that may want to use this off grid without having to carry the paper instructions.,
Just a suggestion.. Can you please make an option to download the selected instructions into the device rather than having constant connection? Cheers!,
"my 4 year old wasn't in to paper instructions though he has used them. he loved this. as an apology, I hate it, but this is great for kids.",
"Solo adult builder, so I need little more than a guide, still this app performs exactly as advertised and is a great step up from instruction booklets.",
Shouldn't have to use an app to put these together. Could have included instructions in the booklet instead of advertisements.,
"Seems to work Ok, was disappointed to learn the 3D instructions are only for the latest sets, no mention of that on the LEGO site page about the app.",
"great simple app, nice and clean.",
I did not like using the virtual instructions rather than a physical manual. Additionally I could not figure out how to set the combo,
this app is amazing! great for finding instructions for sets you have had for years and lost the original instructions.,
There was a few glitches as the product instructions belonged to a whole different product and sometimes the app would close on me with no absolute reason.,
"I'm a lego collector an I Love it, I can keep track of all the sets I've got and can use the instructions on the app if I ever lose the paper copies.",
It doesn't have a 3d representation. So it's actually photos of the hard copy instructions.,
Fairly useful app for looking for Lego sets and finding lost instructions. Only wish the dates went back further.,
This is actually really cool! my daughter and I have used this twice now and it helps her better understand the brick placement. Good Job Lego!,
"My instruction book was missing a section, which was replaced by another section being repeated. Didn't enjoy using my phone instead. Really enjoyed the build, otherwise.",
it's fun but very long to build!!!,
"Would rate it 5 stars, but it's missing some recently released sets. I did cover most of my sets. But it currently doesn't have Lego set #11008. Will change my review if this is corrected.",
It would be amazing if i could use it everytime it's about to load 3d instructions it crashes if there's a way to fix this I will boost to a 5 star,
I downloaded it for set 60353 which doesn't have instructions but it's hard to exit once you have looked around I really like the Lego life app excellent my daughter loves it and you can log your sets on there,
"Getting this because the instructions page on the lego help has been taken down for some odd reason. And I couldn't even find what I wanted, which was the lego creator pug 3 in 1 polybag. What a pile of garbage.",
This app is great the only reason I reated it 4 stars is cuz on the set lego minecraft the crafting box 3.0 itmissplaced the lego bricks 🧱 on some parts of the model. So I recommend using the real paper biulding instructions.,
100% is way better then the book. I'm new school im so glad this app exists i can finish building my kids Legos faster. The 3D animation is spot on,
"Pretty amazing. I'm actually just about to get into Lego building. This is gonna help me lots. I appreciate this app, especially if you're missing the instructions from something.",
I love this app but it would be really cool If they added a sand box feature so we could build on the app and then build our creations in real life.,
"my 6year old son and I put it together with no problem, very well thought out, enjoyed playing and putting it together,with out all the extra headache. 👍👍👍",
"app is great, even display retired sets. I just wish I can download some of the manuals simply for faster load time",
Sad to see the joy of Lego being destroyed for kids by being made to stare at a screen to construct it. One of the last wholesome activities for kids corrupted by technology. Such a shame.,
this game is fun I do have a set of Legos that are classic and I use them to make what I wanted to make. please download this game. ( only if you have Legos),
Hi! I find this model of moderate challenge for my 6-year old and it is great! He is happy that this is a 2-in-1 kit! Excellent job!,
The app is good but every time I try to get in the app it frezzese so yesterday I tried to unistall it and download it again but it is not downloading it just says a ero acured when it's in t installing phase please tell me how to fix this.,
Annoyed. Don't like building by the book hard for me to understand bought a Megalodon monster jam truck and the app doesn't have a 3D build so I won't be able to complete this build,
Pdf loading hang with what looks like a Lego loading bar. Instead of just giving you the digital manual they want to mine your data. Uninstalling this junk.,
"I think there was an update that messed things up. Lost all my sets, sets are not well organized. Please fix it🙏",
These Lego building instructions come in very handy. I'm terrible at keeping the instructions for my kids' projects. This app has the answers to all our Lego building mishaps,
great for little ones to help them with building. Nice and neat way of storing all instructions in one place.,
awesome app! allows me to save the actual instructions from wear and tear of use and I love the 3D view! it makes things really user friendly!!!!,
So much easier than having a massive book on your workspace. Being able to zoom in and sometimes have a 3D model is 🤌🏻,
Not impressed .I am a grandma who builds this for my granddaughter not tech savvy . I much prefer paper instructions. Writing and pictures way to small for my eyesight,
"Cool app, smooth, really easy to find what you need but in my case I need the good stuff from 1996 to 2004 and those are non existent on the app.",
"The instructions are very clear. It would be nice if the colors could be added but other than that, it was great! I really enjoyed the build.",
Basically useless because the search bar doesn't bring up my keyboard to input a search. Please fix! I'm on Pixel 4!,
Really good. Except I keep adding the same set and it disappears from my collection after 2 seconds. Very annoying,
Nice app. Easier than downloading the files manually. Like this all instructions in one place. FYI set 60109 Fire Boat is missing,
"Awesome, most kits have interactive building instructions, which makes the building more fun than leafing through the traditional handbooks",
The pictures were too grainy to easily tell where the pieces should go. Much easier to read from the book,
Works better than the booklet easy to use maybe on a big job you're battery might run out before you finish but otherwise it's great,
App keeps crashing to home screen on tablet other than that it's a good app for if you lose the instructions.,
second time using Lego instructions online. first time finding the power up option for train. a label between regular and power up could be helpful.,
So much easier and step by step instructions,
Not a bad app. It would be nice to be able to see mayne a green check mark when looking through the search.,
It would be nice if all instructions were available. I can't get the 2020 BrickHeadz Nutcracker one from the app. Luckily I can download through the actual site but it would be nice to have it here too.,
All I gotta say is my sons 6yr old and he sits by himself and builds all his Lego's and its easy for him too use and he loooves the gallery that it shows which ones he has n is missing.. Great app for kids who love Lego's!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤👌👌👌,
Ok directions. Black on black makes seeing where the pieces go a bit challenging sometimes.,
Search is broken in the app on my Pixel 4A. My keyboard doesn't show up when I select the search bar so I can't type or paste anything.,
it doesn't have the rest of the instructions for set 43221 as indicated in the website,
I was never into Lego. My Nephew's kid me a set for Christmas( I think he had doubles lol). Downloaded the app and really liked it. Very easy to use!,
"Doesn't have all the instructions, only the sets within 5 years or so(no hero factory or og Bionicle ECT) which is the reason I installed it. They have all their instructions available for free on their website.",
pretty neat.....other than you can't add the same set 2 times for the 2-1 sets....not a huge deal but it should count towards your part count,
A great place to look up the instructions that I have lost.,
I was excited to try this app out however it hasn't worked with any lego set I have every time I scan a code it says oops something went wrong and won't load if I search by set number,
Great idea. Older sets are missing though and some can't be added to collection.,
It's very good and the newer sets give a 3d image you can rotate. It makes building with 2 autistic kids so much easier,
It's litterly just access to most of the instruction manuals and a 3d module. Not really a game.,
Spend all the money on these Legos for no instructions in the box. Not ALL PARENTS allow kids to have phones! This is a crock! Also some kids need the paper to follow instructions se children are very visual. (Special needs kids won't like the phone app idea),
"Really good app since if you do not like paper instructions you can just do them there,and you can look at lego you might want to buy.",
"Too slow. I can't build anything it just build for me. It doesn't seems like I'm building, it just like the game is building. This game is too boring. Just a waste of time. That's what I think about this game, needs to be better",
I dont like it because i thought you can actually build the sets on the game but no pls update it and make it let you actually build the sets on the game but anyways its fine its not the best game ever i admit,
This app would be better if showed 3d images of what you where trying to build since the real life book let can be confusing in some of it's directions,
"Great app, unfortunately it crashes randomly after being open for more then 10 minutes.",
The whole point of lego is a mindful activity. Its been 30 mins of downloading apps that are clogging up my phone. I hate it. I buy lego for my kids to get off the ipad and now they need it to do lego. No more lego the worst decision you have made,
"extremely easy. just many,many pieces. it was fun to put together. Not like an IKEA product 😂😂😂",
Excellent for toddler's from 4 & up. It wakes his attention and interest for following instructions and be calm for a while.,
The 3D instructions are a game changer!!! My 3 year old is doing builds for 5+. We're going to build so much!,
"An excellent tool for pieces, methods and sequences. My grandson always look at the instructions. Blessings from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷",
is good but i think that we can put the price of the lego,
This helped me rebuild my Lego electric car 😀,
Hate this. Send the instructions. App refuses to update and my son can't build the lego I just paid for! Can't even go to the website to view instructions. Deleted app and it still won't. Send the instructions!,
This is 1 of the best games I downloaded out of 57,
This app is amazing it shows exactly what you need and has most of the sets even from 1991! It's amazing iwoud give it higher then 5 stars if available ✨️,
"No way to close app on Samsung Galaxy Note 9. No hard Home button, app takes whole screen with no way to exit!!!",
"Good app, but is it possible to add older sets? The internet is full of older instructions, I don't see any reason why we couldn't have it in the official app.",
Graphics glitches make this app unusable. Moving the model causes it to disappear completely.,
The worst app for Lego by Lego. It doesn't allow you to quit the app and only work for paper instructions which comes with the box... Do NOT install!,
Great app that guides you through the build. Recommended if you find the book too bulky to use or your space for building is small,
i love it so much i think that it was a magical,
Easy to use and simple to understand (as was the booklet); it would be nice if there were animations to make it more fun 😀,
The last two pages are extremely vague in finishing the build. I've ended up throwing them in as bark chips.,
"Never saves login, dispite it selecting the correct account from the page. Cant seem to scan any of the barcodes on this phone, doesnt want to autofocus",
I love this app. I am a Lego fanatic and I use this when I lose my instructions. The ability to find what I need is amazing 5 stars.,
fun easy set to build,
makes putting Legos together much easier,
This is fun to do and I think it easier for me.,
It has the sets I used to have but lost the instructions for,
Great. Easy to use and fun.,
that was the first time I tried the construction for the LEGO Builder App,
Very entertaining to my child,
"This app is amazing. However i do want to see a ""wishlist"" section and 3D for all sets. Also when can we expect this update?",
So i just update it and its was fine no lag or bugs and its working fine the app i hope you guys can add tgv train or other trains model also plane models because there's oy few of them also cruise ship/yacth i would like to see them in the future updates :D,
From what I have experienced with the app on my phone before it's a wonderful App some sets are easy to find others are a little hard to find but 5 out of 5,
I love the idea but the only problem is not every set is on here or every theme I have sets from the cars 2 line and season 2 ninjago sets and I can't find instructions for them on here,
Some peices in instruction are sometimes hard to see the color other than that great app if you don't have instructions to your Lego set.,
This is a nice app!! It helped my 5 year old get a better look at where certain lego pieces go when he gets stuck.,
I gave this a one star because they do not have the technic set 42091-42090 in 3D . I dismantled everthing only to find out it did not work.,
absolutely amazing app,
"You can go through the steps to build your set, but it would be nice if I could print out the PDF so my phone is not all tied up while we build.",
I really like that we can see all the sets of Lego. But I didn't like 3D option In other cases preety good .,
Does not show the extra instructions that don't come with the paper instructions. We just want to build the whale :(,
I feel like you should add more of your older sets like the lce planet line. It would be 10 times easier putting together my old sets.,
awesome amazing very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very awesome very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very awesome very very very good very good very good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good Google could you go to good good good good this is helpful game the instructions of your new Lego set and you have this app,
"what a brilliant idea to always have the ability of a pdf of the building instructions on an app too, and able to see all the sets you own on the app after scanning the QR code, great job Lego",
It's good but i do it on my phone which makes the screen small and it annoying so that's why i use the book i just use the app for looking at lego set i want to build.,
we finished a 163 piece kit within 45 minutes very good pictures if anything too many. this also took that allocated time while my son played with the wheels for most of it lol,
"still like the instructions coming with the set, but this app does help a lot if you lose a set of directions.",
good app but incomplete and slow for bigger sets. could use a download function to accelerate load times.,
Great challenge piece... wouldn't recommend it for ages below 12 years as some of the instructions really put your memory to test.,
"Nice to have and with the 3d features including Zoom and axis rotation, really helps in the build.",
This app is AWSOME I have like 56 lego sets all together witch is mine and my brothers and we don't have alot of the instructions to build them so this app is awsome. I have alot og the lego friends sets and I think k this app has all of the sets 😊 I LOVE THIS APP!!,
I think I miss the instruction book!!!!!you charge way to much for this plastic junk at least include instruction manual.,
The app is really nice for the new sets. I hope in the future they can add some of the older sets to the app.,
"One star because when I went to scan the QR code, it kept saying ""Unfortunately, Instructions has stopped"". Please fix this so I can use it again.",
Can't even login,
"bro, this shows you a 3-D model of what you need. I highly recommend this app.",
"It's a nice app, but doesn't have anything older than 1994, which sucks for me, I have about 20 space lego sets. Don't think I will use thus app.",
Not complete instructions.. even for lego movie 1. But overall its nice. You can create and see your collection list provided it can be searched,
this saves so much space by letting me recycle the instructions plus you can get building instructions for sets that aren't for sale anymore!,
I can find out some missing guide.,
it was great how you can use the app to build your Lego and have ideas in the app so U can change things around and also have a story about the different animals good on you lego,
App is slow and so many instructions are missing. The database is incomplete so there is no point.,
"A great site for those with no instructions for their Lego rebuilds. I didn't realise just many different Lego sets there were. Good job, Thanks",
Nice app. Easy to use and good variety. They need to load up the vintage sets to earn the 5th star.,
"Overall, this app is really helpful, especially others who have losted they're instruction manuals on LEGO sets, and it's great!",
"This app is ideal for assembling Lego sets. The instructions are clear, and navigation is simple.",
the best thing in the multiverse,
"I love this instructions because I have this one but it was retired but when I open this PDF, l see that it was not retired and can make for long time!!!",
Low quality images of instructions. Can't zoom in or it's too blurry to see anything.,
absolutely amazing app,
Best LEGO app I've ever used.,
"I had issues with the app closing when trying to load in the blueprint for Raya, but after reinstalling the app everything has been going great!",
I like it cuz it helped me build my slushy van,
Thos os good for instructions,
Not bad to pass the time 😊,
Won't let me login or create an account,
I would be helpful I imagine could move the page around after I blow the image up larger to see things at the edges of the page.,
"App suggested I create an account, which I did. Now it freezes at startup and is completely unusable.",
This app is really helpful because when you get your Lego set and then after a few days this lego set falls and gets destroyed and your instructions are broken too you download this app and you buld your Lego set again :),
"Absolutely stupid! Once you start building one model in app for 3in1 kits, you can't get back to other models",
"did not have all the pieces to my set so I don't know if this was a problem with the app or the set I got, but Lego come on help me out here. I hope you can understand my problem. Thank You",
Very convenient and works great.,
"App works pretty well. There was one set I scanned, and it said I had it, then it forgot the item.",
Really useful. All our instructions always seem to get ripped by the kids so it's so handy to look them up on the app,
Some of the QR codes don't scan (poor printing) but I am unable to type in the codes as the bar does not activate the keyboard.,
I think this is an amazing app because let's just say you broke your Lego set and lost the instructions you can come onto this app and search up your Lego set and bulid. cause that happens to me and I used this app I felt so happy.,
Helps so i can zoom in to see plus it doesnt reflect like the paper book version in the light.,
If you have a lego from years back and lost the instructions and want to rebuild it this is the App for you. My son got to rebuild alot of his Star Wars Legos that broke.,
"Looks good but the vibration on every interaction was just too annoying for me, and there's no way to turn it off.",
This app is wonderful. You no longer have to worry about keeping the little booklets or if they get lost or damaged. Love it!!,
Will scan new sets but no longer adds them to my collection. Unable to update details. No point of contact to discuss or inform of bug/ issue,
I never opened the paper instructions. All you need is this app. Very useful and functional.,
It's really good if you lost your instructions open up the app and then you can continue building,
"A great resource to have instructions handy on my phone, but does not have all of Lego's collection available on the app.",
"Then we are in the process of being an entrepreneur and then the first one is a bit of time I b f hop icing sugar, and I think that is a cm la carte menu and then the first place. Dada life, and then you have bee t throughs throughshroughnhroughn using the first time in a decade or two. Saints minis to do that you can get a bit of the first one is going to go go gunk out with you and your friends to beat one that I think about you have a great deal more of your PlayStation store",
"It keeps deleting 2 of the lego sets I have added to my list, and it won't pull up the directions for building them either.",
Great idea my one problem though is when you need to make two of the same thing it does it separately but other than that would definitely recommend it 👍,
This app is amazing. I'm able to find lego manuals from years past. It's everything I had hoped for and more.,
"Best game ever, you can build, check out the new Lego sets and so much more. So you need to get this game, trust me you need this!😁",
best in the world because better than lego instruction book.,
"Beautiful app. Works flawlessly, no ads and I can fix up my old models. Thanks!",
"Just instructions about recent Lego sets, what about the 90th castle and pirates sets? Unfortunately it is totally useless from my point of view.",
I love this app. it keeps track of all of our Lego sets and allows me to throw out the cumbersome instructions!,
Super useful tool not to print anything for rebuilding materials! On your own screen and build instructions!!,
Constantly crashes when loading instructions. Can't make the build I wanted since the paper instruction is not included with the set,
"Honestly 0 stars, but not an option. Terrible app and terrible replacement for an actual hard copy of instructions you used to get in Lego sets",
It's just one of the great builds. This build makes Boba look amazing. Fun to build and suitable for any age.,
Helpful if you can't understand lego pictorials. It animates the build so you can see how to put a piece on. Wish they did these with flatpack furniture instructions.,
"Pretty good app generally,but on tablet it has some hiccups in the 3d mode showing the picture clearly.",
My Kindergartener followed these instructions with only a little help from me and he really enjoyed making this character spin! Very fun ⭐,
if you lose the instructions and the car falls apart no problem just go to Lego and they got the instructions for all the vehicles. thank you Lego,
you would think Lego would allow myself to build the products I don't know why but that's the only dis I got with this app purchases on the phone and now no more than completely agree you should just be a great time for you to do the building after once downloaded the plan aka instructions,
first time user. I will be using the 3d build from this point on.,
I Like To Build The 71360 With This App!,
amazing bit wish I could billed it,
Its amazing and fun,
I want Lego the toys because Frozen building more to me in Roblox,
It would not work at all,
a great thing for starters,
I'm just happy that they kept the mixels,
this is pure Nostalgia!,
thought it was a building game,
Good app free instructions,
Sooooo bad I want to build it won't let me,
this app is so much fun,
This is a great website!,
you are the best Lego robotic,
very nice app,
"very good with wide range, only problem is long loading and sometimes difficult navigation",
Lego sonic hedgehog l Lego Ninjago. Lego avenger. Assembled,
"Crashes every time on 10"" android tablet when startin missions. No paper instructions in the box. Very frustrated child.",
"Lego app does not offer search by pages number. You have to scroll through entire manual, pages by pages to obtain at desired location.",
"Pre last update instructions were far better. When they were 3D. Now they are average, at best.",
"This is really useful, especially if you lost an instruction book, or you just want your building instructions digitally",
I hate your app you guys are really cheap and you don't even print instructions anymore inside of the Lego sets I don't have room on my phone for this this is ridiculous and should still come with repairing instructions you guys are so cheap WOW,
Fix the app. I cant log in. If i press password was forgotten then doesnt send anithing to my mail.,
it's just great all in all and it having no ads makes it 10xmore better and it's easy to use,
very helpful to be able to build these with my daughter although I still prefer the lil booklets than having my phone screen lock every two minutes,
It's really good that you can rotate the map I always struggled whith the old paper maps plus its ecofriendly I recommend installing it 😀,
Absolutely brilliant until latest update meant its no longer working on any of our family tablets - one VERY gutted 5yr old son!!! Needs sorting LEGO. People can't afford to go and get new tablets everytime new updates are done.,
"This is the dumbest thing. I understand and appreciate saving paper, but why not just put a pdf on the site? We got a Luigi's mansion set which has instructions to install this app. This app tells us to search for the build and upon finding the build it forces us to then install ANOTHER app instead of just giving us the build instructions. Honestly maybe we should just stop buying Legos if they're going to make it impossible to get a build going without installing bloatware",
"required to download for instructions, and only sent me to a link to another ""required"" app to download. Shameful corner cutting by Lego leaving the consumers to adapt.",
"This app is awesome! But I have a problem when I sign in to my account. But it's great! No ads, No other problem!",
"Would be 5🌟, but not every set has a 3d instructions, including newer sets. Definitely need to add 3d on more instructions",
Great app! I love that it saves your progress and keeps track of the builds you have done. Great job Lego!,
This is super app and i starting my six lego vhelice,
super complex and made to purchase more - Lego this is NOT Fun! super disappointed with Super Mario. Get back to basics you have lost the ot on what Lego was and should be.,
This app helps a lot you guys even have ones that aren't available you put a lot if work I love legos and this app helps a lot good job and keep up the good work,
some of the sets are missing so plz add them but it is very good because the paper instructins tear easily add hard to see and build later,
paper instructions please Clearly a lot of people don't like the idea of having a toy amed at kids of all ages requiring acces to a phone/the Internet... really appreciated the automated response though thankyou,
fun and easy to use! remembers your place where you left off! wish it had more classic sets,
It is a good way to keep up with sets the only thing is it doesn't some sets at all like any of the lord of the rings set,
"Can't log in, when I select account it brings me back to log in page in app Edit ; it worked later in the day. Thank you!",
not workin on older ipad. all the time crash. i hoped the lego app is for longer period but actually you prepare it might not.,
very easy to use. I love the little lego clicking noise when you swap to the next page!,
"Please add more then just 2 sets for hero factory,also maybe add ninja turtles,lego movie, and it would make the app better.",
Its easy to use and helpfull,
"Good app , love that you can build old sets and is nice for if you do not have instructions.",
beautiful way to completely understand and organize to the max I legit have been playing with LEGO for my whole life Lego has inspired me to become 100% creative in my adult hood but here's the best part me and my daughter are both full blown autistic and honestly she has the mind of a crayola+Lego empire filled of an imagination from 1 parent to another my dearest gratitude is in favor thank you Lego world for never growing up -spooky,
"Needs More Sets I was looking for Lego Mixels (R.I.P 2014-2017) because I couldn't find my Series 3 Footi instructions, so I downloaded this! I searched ""mixels"" in the search engine. It came up with nothing I wanted. Luckily, I found the creator 3-in-1 shark set.",
"my children love this, so easy to understand and child friendly. Will be using this in future rather than paper instructions",
"Surprisingly good app. However, lots of sets are still missing - even some current ones.",
"Did 2 different kits back to back, awesome EASY experience to do! Definetly would have NEVER gotten these two put together without this app SERIOUSLY",
None of my sets were found in the app and most are recent/new kits. Very disappointed. I uninstalled it.,
very Cute app! I love it! makes it easy and fun to build with my 5yr old. Thanks Lego!,
"the app is cool, but it seems mostly to just be a digital version of the booklet that comes in the box",
What's the point? Just a PDF of the printed instructions that came in the box so really don't know what it adds aside from giving lego visibility of what we buy.,
breeze of a build,
Be helpful if someone made a app that uses the camera on the cell to search through all your lego pieces for specific parts so you don't sit there searching through lots of parts,
so excited to find this app. it's teaching me so much about building,
Looooove the app Its really interesting I really love the 3d effect,
makes building so much easier..,
Does what it's supposed to.... the 3D ones are the best.,
Great app for building Lego sets would recommend,
we got 11021 box which had very easy to follow instructions. we got extra bags with no numbers so not sure what to do with those,
very great app to walk you step-by-step through the build,
not really fun when you build,
"amazing, I only found it after I set it all up lol",
"way to much fun, love the brick counter",
Will be better when the additional instructions are added,
I like how it shows how to build the Lego set.,
would be 5 stars? but still missing some sets,
very easy to use,
I very much enjoy using the app but I'm not a fan of it randomly closing itself and not saving what page I was on.,
Is it great it's a great thing I used to build all my Lego you should really download it if you have a chance can use it in my opinion I didn't get the best in my mom uses there when she's there my Legos I helped her build them,
Only 2 sets of the 5 Lego idea sets I own are present. I can't even find the last one I bought : 21321 International Space Station...,
"I just downloaded this app after I scan the barcode from book, but it keep crashing. So dissapointed!",
"Very helpful incase ur instruction/s got lost. Finding the product is very easy, atleast that's for me, still a very good app",
I love the app very well made 👏 1 resins I love it because when I lose the Book I can't find it so this app helps a lot 2 I lose the book a lot and my lego get damaged so this app helps a ton 😀 soooo ty lego,
"makes it easy to build sets without a booklet that is either lost/destroyed, would recommend for Lego building sessions 👍",
terrible app worst thing ever I couldn't I couldn't even get it a 0 star rating it makes you download it three times and then it says sorry your thing can handle this I can't even build this thing with all of my Legos I have a whole tube of it this gets this app gets me super annoying I don't download it worst thing ever 👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺,
just used for the first time and I very much prefer the app. supe easy and convenient. highly recommend.,
Cool app! However I cannot add some older sets that have 4 digits like 7784 and 7754 which I got from the paper manual.,
I love having the steps on a stand and not trying to keep the pages from turning on their own.,
Just like lego marios app this one helps me whenever I get sets that aren't mario with easy instructions although I miss the books this is good,
I love this app. I like the ability to have access to all my lego instruction booklets in one place.,
"couldn't finish buildings Ng it as missing too many parts yet again, seems every time I build an architecture set I have pieces missing",
love the app with the architecture series. incredible leaflet came with my purchase that's now how I access the same book while it sits on the shelf,
it's a bit slow in loading sets and doesn't have all of them. But otherwise it is very good.,
really helps the kids focus on the build. shows better where pieces go and less likely to miss a brick,
this game is cool,
Its very helpful especially when the lighting in your room isn't great and you can't see the instructions its also handy for when the instructions fold by them selves,
"Amazing app, renders all paper instructions unnecessary and makes keeping track of you LEGO collection much easier!",
"Somecolors are hard to make out (grey 2 ton some pages are filled with adding just 1 or 2 bricks, kinda of a waste just to make the booklet thicker",
"very easy to follow instructions, tilt, pan and zoom around your part, or to take it back a few steps to make sure you've done it the right way.",
"Hey Lego,Now You Might Be Questioning Why I rated it 1 star.It Is Cause when I wanna build the bat blaster and batmobile,The Instructions are not showing the Instructions to build them. Also,I Bought It At DD's",
"great set, so cute and fun to build. rated 6+ and my kid had no problem building it on her own.",
It looks really fun but i try to go on the friend's legos it does not stop loading but it looks really nice to to play with.👍😀👌,
it didnt have all the sets. the colors were terrible as the purple and pink were exactly the same.,
"Not sure how this is step-by-step. Its showing me the minifigs in the set,and won't progress further.",
"got 2in1 set only to find out it has instructions for only one configuration, while the other one is behind a 100MB glorified web browser.",
"Had been waiting for a digital option for building instructions, and this is basically flawless. Well chuffed",
The lego set didn't come with instructions. After downloading this app and scanning the qr code the instructions still were not found. Useless,
"The app is nice however, it's a little annoying to flip from page to page because the app can be touchy",
I like this app but it takes time to load a big instructions. But its good as manual for our lego sets there are all lgo sets in i like this app,
This app is absolutely what i wanted if ur box and instructions get lost u can still build ur lego by searching what ur model pieces look like mine looked like a helecopter i searched helecopter and it gave the same instructions best app ever,
its hard to keep the page open so its nice to just press a button and your on that page no more flipping hope that i can make that Thanos lego with the app,
very good app to let you play Lego,
Horrible. Crashes as I open each larger build. Mini figures no problem. But,
Everything's fine but even though Lego System was removed doesn't mean you remove it I was searching my basement found a 1993 Lego System Instruction Booklet!! Also saw other people who had Lego System sets on the internet!!,
Downloaded the app expecting to be able to build with legos on my phone like the lego building program for PC...i dont wanna see instructions i wanna build stuff on my phone so that when i get home i can know what im looking to do with my own pieces....i dont see a point in this app👎👎👎,
"Helpful, but the regular instructions are much easier and dont have to load. The apps instructions take forever to load",
Having trouble with the Spider-Man Ghost Rider. Every time it gets to the car part the app stops working,
"doesn't do anything, doesn't work. if it does work, then it's so poorly designed that it doesn't matter, which is actually worse from a keeping your job perspective.",
this is a big help,
"It's just the instructions included with the set, not an actual building app.",
Not sure if it deserves a 5 star because I would love it if you could drag it and place it so I will send a 4 star ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐,
On the instructions on the 3D models don't work very good,
"Very cool. I'm a huge Lego need, though not S big S I told myself, lol. It's really cool to build sets using the kits instructions in 3d",
app is very awesome i recently had a burglary in my apartment and I lost all my instructions and my entire Lego collection this app is helping me to rebuild my Lego life Lego is stepping up it's game I'm a Lego lover forever Lego has turned it up too eleven,
good app and instructions are clear but it's not always saving to my collection or even offering the option which is super annoying!,
Will randomly crash and kick you out of the app. The app would be fantastic with this glitch being fixed,
"Very buggy, wasn't working at all, tried reinstalling and now unable to login at all or even register.",
"I like playing Lego.This app can give me to know how much pieces in the box. This app can Iet me know what is the year of the set,the age and how big is it.",
So cool to have this right at your fingertips. Especially if you buy bulk lego for working on expanding your city.,
Brilliant idea. Frees up your hands a bit more. This made my building experience much easier :-),
The App doesn't work. It always crashes after the Lego logo. It never really starts.,
The app will not display the instructions. It just says it has stopped working and closes,
Well My Son Was Amazing At It,
"Hi, there appears to be a bug in the app which means that some building instructions cannot be added to a users account",
there should be an option for you to have an account as an adult instead of having to make a child account. other then that it's great.,
This is perfect I used it to do my LEGO® set and it told me the exact instructions that it needed and when it was done it looked amazing ☺️.,
"An awesome little app if you have any interest in LEGOs. If there were something like this for when I was a kid, my parents would have been bankrupt. Now I only have to worry about myself.",
Great tool to use whilst building. I find it easier than the instructions because you can zoom in.,
Really good! easy to use and just great! but it's often a bit slow. A fix to that would be nice.,
I had lost my old Lego Star War set instructions and this app helped me make one of my childhood sets again it was great.,
It was basically the same as the paper version. I could not move the picture at all. DONT GET THIS. IT IS FALSE ADVERTISING!,
Uhm its dosen't work on mobile? But i thought it was pretty but no it wouldn't let me play on mobile! I would be happy if you could let us play on mobile it would be better,
It so fun it helps alot!!!!,
Cat find how to add to my collection ? I've scanned with the QR code multiple times I have no idea how to add them it's so frustrating,
the app is so good 💯,
"I was able to create an account, but that's it. The app freezes when I scan the QR code, if I even get that far. 😡",
I be honest is good but is the same instruction on the box and maybe this for people who bought the set and lost the instruction.,
"I'm sure this is a great app, however it would be even better to include instructions for Lego sets that are 4 digits.",
Would love to have access to instructions from sets from atleast 2001 to present I would just enjoy being able to build old lego sets I've had for a while,
utter rubbish. bought for Christmas 21 and found out after building they have cancelled the 'hidden side' features. over priced Lego nonsense as always,
Love having the instructions in a digital format. I can get rid of the paper format all together ❤,
It just pictures of the construction we can't even move them but it could be good if you lose your instructions for a set,
was very nice to have an app so building a model with a buddy doesn't require you to share the instruction book.,
it's the worst app ever it closes by itself and it also forces me to submit my rate. saving the book is easier,
App continues to crash upon start up loading. Im unable to access any feature this app claims to have.,
I really like this little set the camper will go on my campground when I get It built. plus the baby was a nice touch for a family camp,
This is a very good game but only bag number 1 i could see but all the other bags are like gliched and when i tap them to open them it just gives me shivers😦 Its just that please fix it😢,
Really useful! I have a tub full of old instructions from the last 25 years that I can throw away now.,
"It's good for finding instructions, but I wish there was the instructions from older sets.",
Just downloaded and signed up. Can't login and QR code scanner doesn't work. Using a pixel 5 android,
"Fabulous! The instruction booklet remains pristine, albeit defunct. Less paper more trees!",
"one of the best product, my son liked it so much and it's super simple to fix the peices.",
"Great instructions as usual, haven't built it yet mine is arriving in 2 days, I'll leave another review when I'm done.",
"This is my first Technic set and I think it's great, great fun to build and brilliant end result",
easy to find instructions. definitely worth getting if you have kids with Lego.,
"Huge safe-saver, tried my best to keep all the books but some have missing pages..this is perfect!",
"Just want instructions, not this!!! I don't want to have to have my kids on my phone to build their lego! Will not be buying any more lego if this is going to be they way they are going from now on! Not impressed!",
Good but.... Theres a tonne of sets missing.. like artitecter sydney opera house and Rockefeller Plaza.. and other sets including the first series of the lego movie and way more!?,
great app. I wish you could jump forward to a page number and not have to scroll through.,
"300+ Page PDF manual that scrolls half a screen at a time, with not even a link to the start of the different designs (3-1 kits). Did the work experience kid design your new Instruction and packaging system?",
Cool to see 3D instructions and interactive app. As an avid LEGO user as a kid was so cool to relive this with my daughter in Christmas 🤩,
does exactly what's advertised - digital instructions for any set from the last few years! So useful!,
It's so hard to see the pieces it has white spots all over its disappointing lego. You can do better,
Good but there is a mis direction for the seventh mode the scorpion on set 31058 where it shows four of the same piece even though there is only three,
Tried to install several times on new tablet. It will not open. Stuck on white screen.,
"Can't exit from this app, it just blocks all the menu controls. The QR code keeps vibrating over the codes on Lego bags and boxes, but never loads anything",
No instructions for sets older than 2013. Also extremely confusing app UX and exrremely difficult exit the app. I would think even freshman it student would make much better app fumctionality,
I love using this app! I'm one of those people who always loses their place in the instructions booklets. This solves that problem.,
"Doesn't recognise half of the QR codes, and won't open the keyboard/paste to enter set numbers. Unusable.",
"great app for following your progress. bit difficult to see on a phone, but still love it.",
I love this app,
Lots of lags when using. Had to turn my phone on/off. Shame it's not a 3D construction.,
"like the app, but have been experiencing crashes when trying to use the 3D instructions to build 60254",
This helped me alot on my kai fighter cause I wasn't able to build the wing so I went on phone and the ad went on my screen and I do an loaded it and it helped ALOT,
I love building Lego so I want you to make way more of these games I love lego I dont play this much I play it days please make more like this and add more lego builds cuse I love legos and Im sure avryone loves legos too can you make a lego game like this but make it on the device I always wanted a game like that so can you make one or maybe a game you can choose if you want to do it on th device or in real life I hope you can make the games I love the game I hope others do to bye guys fun app,
"Okay so, this is an AMAZING app! But.... I don't know if im missing something but it won't let me Log in. Not sure if I'm doing something WRONG but like I said, I can't Log in.",
"It is the best building game ever. I give 5 stars because it is having buildings, Cars Etc. Thanks for making games like this. Please make more games. 😎😎🤘🤘😇😇🤗🤗😊😊",
"This is good if you lose the instructions, but you can't really build the set as a 3D model on your phone.",
"Awesome app. Lose your instructions? Well, this has it. Want to try to build a different set out of your current Lego? Well this will help get you there",
love it. I can build the sets that broke and I lost the instructions long ago.,
No way to access the instructions for the second build for 2 in 1 sets. You're better off just using the PDF.,
"Great app. My 5yo was able to follow the full build, step by step, with no need for me to intervene",
Very good app recommend because I lot of people have lost instructions or some want to build sets they don't have but have peace's to build it so I recommend installing this ap over all,
"Requires way too many permissions, only contains a small number of instruction sets. Lego is getting evil.",
I love this it is so great to see my Lego sets even if the get lost and if I want to build a new Lego set with my friends I Just use this app I highly recommend it,
"Awful, if this is the future of lego I won't be purchasing any more for the kids. Bring back the instruction books please!!!!!!",
I think it adds a modern-day feeling to the nostalgic feeling as an adult of playing with Legos and for sure enjoy this app,
My kids could do the whole setup on their own. They are still small and enjoyed it so much,
"this is a fantastic app from lego as you can now leave your instructions new, sealed in original packaging, perfect.",
All of the graphics don't load properly was disappointed because I destroyed my kit and wanted to rebuild it but I can't now thanks Lego,
"There are lots of great sets on here, but it is missing ones. Maybe it needs an update?",
"very easy to use and instructions are easy to follow! for its purposes, very good app!",
"No freaking Lego app lets you scan the QR code on package with Lego. It brings only frustration, this is app number 2 and time to go off Lego for search",
The 3D effect makes building sets extra easy for the whole family to use! Awesome app.,
Very nice! I have lost countless instructions only to find them on here! Thank you for this amazing app!,
"It helped me build all of my lego sets, without it I would have never even picked up the first block. The best app for lego builds ever",
Keeps my sets and instructions together. Would be cool if I could build my sets online and store them.,
3D instructions made this very easy. My 5 year old put together a set rated for 7+ using 3D instructions.,
I like that you can use this to keep an inventory of your sets. But I can't log in.,
I don't see a 3D view of my set. Seems it's just the instructions that came with it. Pure waste of my time,
"Works fine on my phone, but my son can't use it at all on his Lenovo m8 tablet since half the graphics never appear.",
I now have all the instructions at my fingertips! Awesome! Now if only there was an app to keep track of all the pieces... ;),
it's way better than using the manual on pages its better online since you can zoom in and see what parts youvneed,
It crashes when you speed through the 3D instructions. I have a Samsung 22 Ultra.,
it's good quality app and for a global corporate it is quite undemanding for an app other than the user to simply have a fun realistic Lego building experience.,
this is an awesome option for people that dont like to keep the physical instructions 🤗. well done Lego!,
barely works (consistently crashes) and adds way too many steps to an otherwise simple build,
I can access the instruction booklets even if you don't own the set. Fun to look at.,
"A lot of sets and instructions are missing, not all current and past sets are in this app.",
Keeps crashing works fine looking for manuals but when I click on a specific model it crashes every time,
"It's Lego instructions on the big screen! And, you don't have to ruin the book with creases!",
"Fun alternate build. I actually bought 2 sets, so I can one of each model!",
"On Android 11, search does not pull up a keyboard. Pretty much unusable.",
LEGO building instructions,
A fun build with my 5y/o grandson. Well organized instructions. The extra pieces encouraged his creativity.,
able to zoom in with digital instructions. plus keeps instructions booklet new/mint condition.,
Really good and Good Reviews,
App ok but engineers at Lego should do a better job in making less painful LEGOs. It still hurts like hell like it did 50 years ago when stepped on and grandkids purposely leave it in my way.,
"The app was installed and once you select your item to build, it immediately crashes once you select the first segment to open instructions",
Cant this be used on a PC?,
"absolutely ridiculous! the instructions should be included in the box! the whole point is to get kids off the electronics. sorry lego, it is not a new and cool way for my kids to build legos",
The app doesn't let me do anything. I try to scan the QR code to add a set and It crashes.,
Nice family game,
"It helps alot, I could see all instructions of the new lego sets, old lego sets, and also venom ones, its so dope.",
Basically a collection of pdf manuals to one's Lego sets. I was expecting new ideas.,
It doesn't even load fast I won't recommend you to download it but it is helpful for other sets but it doesn't load the sets that I have .,
I love flipping through these books and love the set 31199 not to mention that set looks so awesome and it's 3 in 1 def going on Christmas list,
14 Jul update (2.0). Can no longer zoom in with Android. WTH! Reverted back to previous version.,
Lego is my favorite company and I like it but I never found it in Jaipur and I like them so much and i have about 900 pieces cost 5500 rupees and it is the wonderful app,
Good for keeping track of sets that I have. And instructions are awesome.,
It helps you with the Mario with no instructions and it helps you if you have no instructions so this is a good app And you can use it if you don't have any pieces you can go like back and see if you don't have that pieces and you can get that's the best thing cause you can literally just get them at the lego store and and you can also get a lot of stuff familiar restores so you like like the Mario says so all Mario says don't come like don't come with the thing the the instructions they don't c,
it's fun but we should be able to buy Lego sets on this app too but it's really fun,
it's amazing it's a easy app to use I would 10/10 recommend no ads either so its really nice,
The adds look great for this I just hope the download was worth it so I can build my Lego car garage,
"App works well, except non-chrome default browsers fail to login to a Lego account.",
This app literally crashed my device its probably not their fault maybe my tablet is to weak to handle it so I gave 5 stars anyway their a great company still,
Good and reliable app that can let other people help you build your lego set,
at one point it froze the checkpoint at a spot I had already passed and it wasn't reading the qr code for the Lego technic Camaro,
Amazing it's better than having to flip pages that are crumpled up,
Its okay But it's just crashes alot and the manual skips steps and I had to redo the titanic from scratch:( pls fix the problem,
this has to be the worst app i have ever had to use its a loop of telling you that your not signed up after i singed up 3 times in row,
Thought I would be able to build something. It just shows sets and whether or not they're discontinued,
we don't need more reasons to be on our screens. I liked Lego Mario cause it got my son off the screens.,
It's great for if you want to rebuild a set even if you don't have the instruction books anymore.,
"Excellent app, really smart. Helps my 4yr old engage with the build, and be part of that process.",
App keeps crashing when trying to view 3d instructions. Totally unusable.,
Very simple to follow and very straightforward. I definitely recommend this to any brickheads out there!,
the best app for all ages,
This is amazing! I love that I can build sets I don't even have. Who ever thought of this is a genius. Thank you so much for the great app. ❤️👍,
this is a great way to see the build in 3D. you can see where the pieces fit and how they go together.,
Great! Wish you could zoom in though. And why can't Lego give us access to older sets?,
would be nice if the page view didn't keep popping up on the bottom would get in the way when it did.,
"Simple but very useful for building sets, especially if more than one person is working on the same model.",
I love this lego building instructions app a lot because I look at lego sets that are coming out or look lego sets that I want buy and it thow all the instructions for each lego set that I want buy well and if you are lego fan like I am then I highly recommend that you install this app.,
pretty cool. wish we had this as kids when our directions went M.I.A,
"awesome app had some lego sets from when I was younger, instructions long gone but at least I am still able to recreate",
"What a great app for building LEGO sets! Even instructions older, retired sets are available.",
"very easy to use. has pretty much every set, but some are missing. I really recommend!",
"eh, all it did was help me not paper cuts or use much energy, but I like screens so... win win!",
Let me ask You one thing what's the point of a Lego instructions app if it takes less time to build the Lego kit with the app than with the actual book.,
"Garbage. Put the instructions in the lego set, not an app. I'll never buy a set again.",
"Really cool app! Hope they add more sets, especially older stuff like from the 80s and 90s 😊",
"I can't get instructions for second model of the truck I bought (42088 Cherry Picker and Tow Truck) . I get instructions only for the 1st model that i got in the box, but for the 2nd one not and that instructions I really need.",
graphics are a bit poor. it's difficult to let the small pieces apart.,
this is so dumb there's no instructions for some of these games I just bought one of the Mario's with the bomb guys and there's no instructions on how to build it in or on any of these apps I downloaded both the Mario and the Lego,
Useless. Lego set for kids in supposed to go online for additional instructions but Lego webpage is trash and can only download PDF of existing paper instructions. Download this app and it's the same instructions that came in the box where are kids supposed to find all the extra instructions,
it's a useful app that's only real use is to shamefully collect even more private and personal data.,
I have to give my son my cell because app willonly connect thru gmail acount which is connect to my cell. I cant down load it even on my laptop or his ipad. So my cell is tied up while he is usingthe instructions,
first off lego sets have become ridiculously priced and $60 for a 35 yr old super mario Brothers?? how long have they milked this ?? then the sets don't even come with instructions which they don't tell you on box then you have to download app so they can get all in your business and blast you with advertising. screw lego's. they sure aren't the toys we grew up with and built their empire,
well I think making Legos with the instruction book is better but yah if there are people like me who mostly lose there instruction book then it soon useful for them,
I don't understand anything and i can't find anything to help me understand. I also don't have any Lego sets on the app. EDIT: I found a Lego set. Uh,
😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾It takes forever to load . And then when I press the arrow to move on it Shoots be back home!!!!!!!!!,
"great app for those who need to zoom in, seriously though I use this along with the instruction book that comes with the Lego",
I am giving you all the 5 stars because this is the best and I can complete all my lego sets very easily. Overall I love this app.,
"app crashes sometimes but other than that it's pretty good, has almost all set instructions",
Very Helpful if u like lost your instructions so you can just find it i love it and i can find the latest lego sets too,
Since this is a registered Lego game can the developers or anyone confirm active updates and support I want to know this game hasn't been left to rot before I download it you get 5stars to start since it would be inappropriate to poorly rate a game I have not tried yett after I get a response and if I decide to proceed with download I'll edit my review to reflect actual gameplay experience,
I like the app I have a huge collection and it's crazy that I can find out how many pieces are in it.,
Awesome!! Great for viewing pieces for me. I got the home alone house for Christmas and it has been a great help!,
Doesn't have a lot of old sets,
"This is not the app to build Mario Legos. Its ridiculous that they don't include paper instructions, and then the qr code points here",
This is useless. I got directed to download this app from the manual and all it gives is the exact same manual. Waste of 100mb download,
Very nice ... They have 3d and 2d guide also... Five/5 stars,
has most instructions. and is easy to use. though it does kind of need an account to use.,
Great app! No more loosing instructions. Hope more sets will be added soon ... (60136) in the next update.,
Super awesome and cool to use when building sets.,
awesome but would be better if you could rotate piece on both axis for more precise view of placement,
"Awful. No matter how many times you try, it doesn't matter if you use it your lego account, you get the default female avatar. Awesome for boys.",
42093 double build will not open up the hot rod instructions. Errors out. Was not easy to navigate through the site.,
"Lego,could you plz make a game where you scan away your Lego sets and then it will, add it to a world mean while your doing missions,tasks and mine games Thank you",
You can't build anything just look at instructions but you can look at different sets which is the only good thing,
"S.galaxy 10 plus, I did as you advised, but nothing has changed, and the instruction only opens pdf.",
This app crashes my phone. I had to delete it.,
Its a great app but..when i scanned i expected it would be 360 degree view...but it was a pdf form of the lego book 📕,
my only complaint is that there is no pinch-to-zoom in. only out. it's definitely one of my favorite apps!,
App constantly crashes when trying to follow the lego missions! Renders the lego set practically useless!,
"I really like the app it's a good way to keep record of sets you have or had tho, I wish it went farther back than 2014",
the zoom is covered by the pages at the bottom when you are trying to get a closer look,
"Latest update December 2021, when I push on the continue button it is crashing. Please fix real soon.",
Excellent app. My 5yo loves it and finds it really easy to follow the instructions.,
pretty smooth app,
"Since update, impossible to add some sets and others I had already added have disappeared and it is not possible to add them again.",
"Great app - functional, easy to use, with beautiful and vast catalog of Lego sets.",
Id give it a 1 buy im giving it a 2 star because i think it can change the problem is i cant load a lego set i wsit ten mins and it wont load pls fix this,
The Naboo N-1 set is a nice challenge at a moderate ability level and is a terrific looking ship!,
"Incredible , my 3 year old can understand and maneuver this app , he gets so excited to build , this is awesome",
"Nice catalog. Would be good to have filters like age, part count, etc.",
great kit. easy to assemble. took about 1 1/2 hours.,
"This app is great, my kids usually misplace the instructions. This app has every Lego set on it.",
"So far, I try to use this on the simplest and smallest thing they have and it crashes repeatedly",
I buy LEGO to get the kids off their phones now they have to spend more time on them !! No more ovet priced Lego for them.,
Love the idea!! Please update and add more sets. There are a few that I cant find.,
this is amazing for finding your interests in lego and when you lose your instructions it has a pdf for every set,
"Terrible app, and an invasion of privacy. It requires you to submit personal information about you and your CHILD before you can use it. Definitely not worth it. You can find the building instructions elsewhere online.",
This app is very helpful for sets that I don't have instructions for (like I they get destroyed or lost).,
easy and fun with instructions. 7 years old kid also can start to do it!,
"Very handy! App seems to struggle with scanning codes but otherwise, very good!",
It was a good challenge and the ship looks real good when you complete it ✅💯 !!,
"much more convenient than all the books, yet it has the same directions",
Thanks 😊😊😊 Lego for making this application because I lost my Lego instructions book and it was a very big set that I couldn't know how to build this set so I was so upset but I found this app and it really helped me 😊😊⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,
"I tried scanning, first time, it closed out, the other fifteen tries, it completely froze.",
Love the app just wish there was a feature to add friends and share current build and build progress,
Great step by step. 3D selection is like looking at AutoCad drawing....,
love it super useful when you jokingly throw the instructions across the room and can not find the instructions,
just like the book. But please keep including printed instructions for when one can't download them.,
this app is amazing I can build stuff with my own Legos I can build stuff with the Lego set I have with the sets I bought it is just awesome!,
Great app for lego fans but I can't find the creater expert horizon express train set. And 3D instructions are amazing.😃👍,
absolutely amazing! no longer do I have to look for all those lost instructions,
Love it my son always looses the directions so this helps along when we get a new Lego set but they need to update to add the new sets,
This app is very useful if you lost the instruction book so this app will help out a lot more when you don't know the pieces go on.,
It doesn't even have the set that I have wich is lego master builder emmet from the lego movie 2 and it keeps telling me that Im not connected to a WiFi when I have 300+KB.,
"I like the idea of digital booklets, but I'm old school and still prefer a real instruction booklet x 😁🤘🏻",
It's better than the instruction book but I miss ever since I use this . btw it's also good for those 2 to 8 years old so ya,
Great app for LEGO instructions. Some instruction sets even have 3D options. My son uses this app when building his LEGOs.,
"I like the app, but I wish it had all Lego sets. I have four sets that don't come up.",
The reason I've rated it is because there should be a section for pirates of the Caribbean and there should be more 3d model sets,
"very helpful instructions and easy to follow pictures, you can also look back at steps",
"Nice and easy way to organise your collected instructions, shame it doesn't include older ones",
"my son got a kit for EL Toro Loco 2in1, my partner built El Toro Loco and I built the Rock Crawler. was good fun and as soon as the wheels were on my son was off playing with it.. lots of fun",
"So many set instructions not on here, surely lego have a tvleast a pdf of all instructions!! Disapointing.",
"Checked app compatibility. Im good. Also tried on latest Samsung Tablet S7+, crashes too.",
"Love the idea, but I put in 5 different sets and it didnt have instructions. Just keeps sending me to the website.",
"Account setup was confusing. Unclear. Not user friendly. I wanted to create an account for myself, not my children! Why does it automatically assume I have children!!??",
really quick. really easy. and you don't need to worry about saving the booklet.😃,
A lot better than paper instructions but this app kills my battery 15x faster than ANY app I've ever had. But why??? Theres nothing to it.,
Cant search older 90s 80s kits by the serial numbers on the app. Otherwise great.,
absolutely love this. helps it be so much easier for my toddler to follow the instructions this way.,
"This is the best app I have used. It's so helpful you don't have to worry about turning the pages in the book, you get a good look at the pieces.",
middle boy got this set for his birthday loved building it he 5 and usually get distracted very easy with the big builds but this one he built all on his own,
A lot of the classic series have extra builds to them but can not them in the app at all,
l love the app but it doesn't have some of the Lego sets l want to build in the 3d mode.,
this is a great app if you want to experiment and make your own logos with spare parts,
Pretty good and great If you loose pieces or instructions,
it updated its title from building instructions to lego builder,
"chill if your on the go and want to build a little project of yours.Easy interface, five stars!",
Sad that the instructions aren't on paper anymore and increase of unnecessary screen time for kids.,
my 4yo can build his Lego sets without my help now. very good app. even helpful for bigger adult sets,
I love this app it helped a lot even people who love there phone so I rate 5 star,
I love the 3D instructions. It made building the set much easier.,
I cannot add sets to my collection anymore (e.g.: 7288) - this makes it really difficult.,
so much fun 🎮🦖🚗🏎️,
the 3d view makes everything so much easier,
It shows all the new sets so you can keep track,
incredible I was about to purchase a set but looked on the app first and it said it was retired so luckily I didn't spent $519,
Omg this thing is amazing if I could post a video I would love to show you how my 3year old can do these 6+ Lego because of this app,
"please add many old building instructions, quantity of owned sets, and specific minifigures rather than series.",
Could not load 3D instructions for the first building of the Bookstore; progress bar loads half way and then gives error message to try again later.,
"This app is HORRIBLE. it made me register before i could do anything, and even after that I COULNT ACCESS THE INSTRUCTIONS.",
"great app, to recreate lego model sets. my kids lose manuals all the time.",
I'm going to build the Lego Minecraft playset right now this will help me a lot play this game well it's not a game it's an instruction Lego playsets if you don't know how to building don't use the wiggle old bowling paper instructions use this app🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂😎🙂😎🙂😎👁😮🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂💎🙂🙂🙂🙂 the only thing I would like to have in this app is you can build in 3D,
Sets only current or in the last couple of years. I wanted instructions for past sets. Not great,
This helped me alot even with bigger sets I'm just co fused why I can't find lego death star 2,
a really good Lego building instructions app I just wish you could rotate the Lego set and get a 360 view,
instructions are clear but could do with an auto zoom on tap feature for size comparisons,
Collection caps out at 120. Any sets added after disappear when the page is loaded.,
App keeps crashing. Doesn't even work. Disappointing.,
Suggestion: include a function to record missing pieces; so that we can buy them at the store later,
IT SUCKS the app crashes every 2 seconds the scan feature is dark as heck and it just SUCKS,
AWESOME!!!! Little set. I had a great yime building this set and the INSTRUCTIONS wete excalent!!!!,
Broken - can't proceed past the initial screen asking my age. Doesn't respond to touch input,
"This app is cool, but it's a hit and miss. When it works, it's amazing. It's just a shame that it crashes a lot.",
Yes ! Finally i thought i will not build the broken lego dragon but since this app is in my tablet i could finally rebuild it back again,
excellent aside not being able to jump to certain pages or go directly to the brick list.,
"Have to use app, no more printed instructions. Difficult for small child to use.",
"Its good app, however thr instruction are very blurry when you zoom in, needs to be fixed",
Not having guide how to combine the bricks!,
really useful for helping younger ones to setup their next pieces for them. really good app,
"Can't just get to the instructions, the app just wants to sell me more Lego... That I'll need to access instructions for",
Downloading 3D and PDF instructions didn't work. I don't want my kid to have to use my phone to build Lego. very disappointed,
its a wonderful app no longer need to worry about losing the instruction when your kid wants to rebuild it,
"I tried to go on it alot but it wouldn't work, it just showed a white screen and a small black dot, I do not know why it does this, but I am not satisfied at all.",
absolutely love seeing what's coming and having easy access to builds I have forgotten about as a child,
the app is glitchy for me and not recording my sets even when signed in and the sets are only from last year,
App is looking awesome. Busy loqding all my collections. Can Lego City 60136 be loaded as well please.,
Not complete. I've been waiting for an update but still nothing for Money Tree set 2023.,
"3d instructions do not work, says it failed to pull the set up and to try later...",
Nice app. Poor color scheme and grainy instructions makes it difficult to see the Steps,
This app is great but the reason i gave it four stars is becuase i like lego mario and it is not as great as the lego mario app and im on a laptop so i can't install the lego super mario app so it sounds like a me proplem,
awesome. I can't wait to get more sets. I just completed the Rubicon wrangler,
A lot of older sets not listed. you should have all sets available.,
Huge drain on battery. My device was nearly dead before I even finished the build.,
"Overall pretty good, but wish you could collapse the groups for your Collections",
The app is pretty good incase you loose the instructions and it works very well.,
so easy to follow and much more convenient than keeping the paper instructions,
It's great how you can twist and turn and zoom in on the set as you're building it.,
"crashes too much, not enough instructions to all the builds and not enough sets",
"This app claims to load instructions for Lego sets, but so far every set I tried it with does not have instructions available.",
"Bad. I just wanted to download some instructions, but you need to have continuous internet!",
awesome app to have at hand. covers every lego model. Well done with this app it's totally stress free 😉,
Does not actually show the 2 in 1 directions and the directions are not included with the kit.,
This app does not work I have been waiting for a long time!! Pls make the app load fast!!!!!,
"Awesome app, I think its pretty cool because you dont have to buy anything, you can just look here and build it!",
"I really like the app; however, most of the sets I have are not in there as they are from the 90's.",
A great app to look for instructions to build your lego. You can also save your Lego collections here.,
a good app but it doesn't include many different instructions for the lego classic set,
Its a good app but there are so many missing instructions and themes which makes it pretty useless,
Great when the sets are there. Only gave 4 as many retired sets not searchable.,
App freezes when asking for my age. Pixel 4a 5G. I see lots of other reviewers with the same phone and issue.,
After app downloads it disappears and there is no option on the screen to open app.,
great for relaxation and helps kids to start and complete a goal.,
"I don't want to say the download is slow, but I'm 80 and I'm wondering if the d/load will finish during my life!",
nice to have instructions on a small device or even a iPad to prop up without the book being in the way.,
Was a 5 star app now crashes whenever I try to open instructions since the latest update on my Samsung S21.,
"crashes on big files, doesn't save place, how about just letting me download the pdf",
"Nice to use when three dimensional instructions are available, most are just .pdf versions available on the LEGO website.",
Keeps crashing really frustrating when your trying to build with your kids.,
"Awful app that scans your booklet then seems to do nothing, please put these additional instructions on a web page, instead of a dodgy app which disappoints young Lego fans.....",
"great app no flaws but i do wish that where was some optional background music, but overall great app",
It is very useful! Thanks to Lego for a digital app to get digital instructions. 😄👍,
"Neat, if the original is lost, could look it up easily.",
I couldn't load the app because a glitch i've tried everything to fix this but it doesn't work,
"The best app for LEGO VIPs! Keep track of, and show others, your progress!",
wicked app for those 2 in 1 kits and for the models which just need that little extra time,
Make it easier to skip to steps at the end and it's a golden app.,
"Doesn't have the older sets in any of the star wars,DC comics super heroes & lego friends collection.",
"if good but keeps freezing on a chromebook ,it gives it a phone view and it always says there is no wifi when i have full bars of wife",
Thank you so glad for this app.Made a 7yr old happy. As he put the instructions in the bin.😁,
Great and convenient. tho can be a little slow sometimes.,
"Not entirely user friendly for desktop users without QR-scanners. Just try to satisfy ALL users, please...",
just like having the instruction booklet in front of me and my daughter. exactly the same clear directions. 5*,
"I was playing with my old bionicles and I was hoping to find some instruction on here for them, but you only have gen 2.",
The app crashes when i go to scan the qr code and the 3D is very laggy and also crashes,
"You should add a wishlist of lego sets,and also add the prices of each set.",
it is fun to build it . a little small but enough to play with.,
It even has retired protects. When ever a new Lego set Comes out we don't need to get a update!,
"Having to download the instructions is very disappointing, got the lego for my 5 year old son don't want him having to stare at a screen for hours on end Should come with printed instructions!",
"much better than paper instructions, makes it more fun and interactive",
"Great, but needs to be available on Android TV i tried sideloading it but it fails to install ☹️",
It's missing set 40174 even though the PDF is on their site. Obviously an incomplete app.,
The step by step instructions keep making the app crash. We used the booklet instead,
Soo when I was trying to scan the code on the Lego bag . It didn't do anything plss update that I would have gave it a five If it worked ☺️☺️☺️,
Great app for helping your build nice animations to show you hard to find spots!,
great idea when you have so many spare parts at home that you could build from these,
"Love the app, but for some reason while trying to assemble my Thanos piece, the app crashes once I get to step 3. Please HELP!!",
When I start an instruction it takes forever to load it's very annoying and that's it,
Nice idea but keeps freezing and locking up my phone so I have to do a hard reset,
Hello and thanks for your excellent application🔥. I have a question Can this program scan my logos and tell me what I can make with the parts of the logos I have?,
Terrible. It keeps stopping and I can't scan the qr codes.,
"pretty neat app, love how it shows all previous sets that Lego has released. very nostalgic from when I was a kid",
Tried to get instructions to build a yoshi expansion pack I got for Christmas but couldn't get them because I don't have Mario,
"Great app, however it's missing all the older lego sets. Which is one of the reasons why I download this app.",
"It was good, but it was confusing how you scan the codes.",
Keeps crashing while trying to scroll to where I left off.,
Updated app keeps crashing and me granddaughter can't use it anymore! Bad Lego!,
Love being able to zoom in and see more detail when building.,
"Very good, I lost my instructions and this let me follow it perfectly it has 3D version which was nice",
Found the vibration of phone annoying during step-by-step instruction and there is no option to disable it,
Loaded on phone after verifying my identity then would not load on my ipad. 3 kids and I am wasting time on an app for simple Lego instructions.,
"When trying to use the 3d instructions, when I zoom in the model dissappears and won't show up",
WOW! I Love this app! It's good if you can't understand the real paper instructions,
Froze as soon as I went to scan set 60239. Had to reset my tablet. Not recommended for any Lego fan.,
"It keeps saying we another all, but the all doesn't work. JUST PRINT instructioNs!!!",
"it's great, you can have another copy of the instructions when you build with your kids.",
this is the best thing ever since I lost that instruction manual this has helped a lot!!!,
"App easy to use but still have some model have no 3D version It""ll be good if can open from computer",
"It's fantastic when it works, but 99% of the time, it won't prompt the keyboard.",
The app sucks I couldn't get it to load oh any of my devices and when it did load it would crash,
"Simple, and good. Nothing else. Reccomend if you lost the instructions.",
"epic app and I love using it also if I want to make something I don't have I can use it to make it from other parts of a different set . ❤️❤️ I love to use it when I want to buy something and I don't know how or what types of parts I will get , I can just see it in this app.😁",
It would be great to have instructions for older sets too.,
"I would rate this 5 stars as it is very good, but it drains battery like there is no tomorrow. Other than that, very good.",
This is a great app and with using it I actually make progress with my sets! Would download!,
I get constantly: No internet and Failed to start up messages for some sets No issue with my internet of course ;),
I love this it shows you how to build and I got one huge like a Mario set and I want to go like a Luigi one because their brothers and I can hook them up together I got all their sex though 😜😜😜😜🇦🇽😆😆😆😆🛳️🚎😘🌜😻😠😻🤭😍🥶🤭🤔😡😻😠😡😠😠🤫🌜😠😱😘😱🌜😘😱😘😠😍😱😠🤭🤭🤑🤭😘🚂☺️😑😝,
amazing app for recent sets. easy to follow and great graphics!,
so happy you added reset button so you don't have to scroll through 350 pages to restart the build!,
The fact that I can zoom in and see the part fitment better really help.,
this app makes it so much easier for 2 people to work together on one set my husband and I do them together as a fun night,
It's very very good. I love this app it helps me alot when I open my Lego box and its instructions are not there I love this app,
much prefer paper instructions rather than giving my phone to my 7 year old to build these packs.,
"It won't even load when I try to scan the code! Plz fix and I'll give 5 star, thx",
Its a really good app but it does not have every set tje set i encounter was 76026 checked and its not there,
"Pretty nice app, it's just when you do 3d building, the bricks are invisible.",
Could use a bit more sound effects. But overall flawless,
Not sure what broke but all my sets disappeared today and if I add any they disappear too...,
Good but can't find some of the models and won't let me add some of the sets I have to collection,
really good app for lost or needed for second instructions so you can build with your technic ect,
Very nice app. Clean and clear. Easy to follow for kids and adults.,
"This is really handy for building, like this I don't have to worry about the book closing 5/5 for me well done",
This this is the greatest up so do you pay it I'm just kidding I love this app now I can watch all my Lego movies anytime anywhere co-broker everywhere so how did you make it the best that I never see my life cuz I'm giving it all five stars how the best guy ever so how much is this app I love it a lot of things looking for this soon as a kid I'm 58 I'm 59 years old I've been looking and looking and looking and looking for this app so how can I find a but I couldn't find that that's the Bullring,
This app is truly amazing! My 6-year-old was able to figure it out for the most part on his own.,
"Have you removed Russian language from the app? My kids used Russian but recently it just disappeared from the list and the app switched to English. Why is that happend? Whatever happens in the world why the kids should suffer? Russian language has a history and the language itself does not harm anyone. Can you comment on it, please?",
App is great but it would be better if you add the price for those sets,
way better than the booklets! being able to spin the car in 3d was great!,
"much easier to find where the parts go, then the regular instructions",
I don't want to have to download an app for my children to be able to build their Lego sets. How ridiculous. Put the instructions back in the damn box.,
Best app ever... I really enjoy being able to have any building instructions on hand...,
I like this app because all you gotta do is search up the number on the book and it tells you how to build it and if I didn't found about this app I would have messed up on my building 👍,
how useless is an app where you have to scan the physical building instructions so that you can view the digital pdf instructions 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️,
It's really nice. I can find the manuals and follow the steps through the app.,
Bought two brand new sets today. Both came out this year. Neither one on the app. What a disappointment,
why would I need a PDF of I scan the manual to get to the PDF? also the Auto focus to scan doesn't work.,
It's really fun because we can discover others lego building instructions.,
"better than using the book, you can rotate and zoom.",
Application is always crashing needs an update ASAP to fix this issue.,
i love the app its so much easier than holding open brand new instructions!!!,
amazing!!! Love Legos Big Time and this app lets me explore my mind full of unlimited creations!!!!,
"App used to work on this older device, now just stops and gives error that it stopped",
"Well my account was deleted , and no 3d instructions either, just built my 1st 1000+ build using the 160 page book.",
"Great app, very useful, I use it all the time when building my sets.",
I'm stuck on 125 with the darth Vader set because with the 1×8 by the thing with the green poles attached to the 1×2 with holes I can't insert the 1×8 and this is a problem!,
I got this app to build a minions Lego set but when I tried to build it I couldn't because it had a glich or i don't know but it was hard to see the Lego i the picture so I could build it,
"worst instructions ever, go back to paper books. slow and confusing",
"Don't even open the books now, straight to this for building. Great App!!",
Managed to sign in. However it would be nice if the app remembered where you had got to in the pdf,
This app is so cool! Has a ton of different ideas for building and creating!,
really good app. i was building a set for my brother for his birthday and the lego life app didnt let me use the instructions like how i did with my lego pod racer so i downloaded this app and i built it ready for my brother.,
"It's okay, but doesn't have animated instructions for all kits.",
Very poor the search button just goes round in circles.,
This lego instructions app is Good. It helped me to complete my london bus and we can watch Wich lego building need wich pieces please like this app,
brill. my 6 year old has the confidence to build on his own now! excellent app.,
maybe a video or text saying what steps are next but so far useful.,
this app is so helpful because we all know our kids lose the instructions but want to build it!!,
Great app. I could not have managed to build my Chevrolet without this app. A Star,
They said there would be a 3D instruction but when we tried to find it there was no option for 3D instructions,
"Good for if you dont have a manual for a set, though i have sets that arent on this its still good.",
It's very useful because I don't have all my lego book instructions so this app is insanely useful. 5 stars,
Wow such a nice app! The 3d representations of the building process is awesome.,
Keeps crashing every time I try to start building.,
Very handy for popular Lego sets that need instructions.. FOR FREE.. Excellent..,
The app is very useful when I have misplaced any instructions but I can't use the QR code without it kicking me out of the app.,
I love it very handy but I couldn't find a search so please add a type in search . .👍,
I scan the QR code on the logo book let the app do its thing then once done it doesn't save to My collection. So idk if I'd use the app anymore,
I.... love.... Legos!!!!!! So much!. and it's so much fun and in my birthday I will buy Legos because I love Legos:):D and turn off your internet connection to don't have adds and you can install mikeCraft for free!!!,
"it doesn't have the 3D mode features, though They say it has!!!",
"Accidentally messed up one of my lego sets, it had the exact instructions here. It helped a lot!",
I would have given it 5 stars but a recent update ruined ALOT for me cuz u cant spin the model around and alot else please fix this.,
Disappointing. I cant even scan one qr code without it crashing.,
"Awesome app especially if you've lost the instructions, true lifesaver!!",
"The LEGO missions sets status is still ""Coming Soon"". It must be buildable and new!",
I love it and I bought a new set but I can't download the instructions app it's saying that it can download it,
Super awesome to use instead of having the books laying around.,
"brilliant app, easy to use, let's you keep track of all your lego sets",
Very helpful when original manuals were ripped by younger siblings.,
love that it has the most current LEGO sets and I can make most of them on my PC on LEGO Digital Designer,
easy to use. still prefer paper manual but it does what it says,
Lots of directions from lego sets. Theres not all of the good ones but great app,
"For as expensive as Legos, I shouldn't have to download such a poorly built app just to get instructions.",
Great for when you can't easily flip through the instruction book,
Wow it took me 3 weeks to make the Lego Technic buggatti Chiron but in this app it just took two days. Wow lego has improved.,
"Zero Stars. Supper laggy, and can't add retired sets to collection. ):",
"Love this app. Huge fan of Lego, and I like the instructions plus feature on some of the sets",
excellent. I just wish there was a print the pdf option.,
I love this so much way easier than uses the instructoins that are made of paper,
I am old and I followed the pictures and built a perfect lego baby yoda with pram. If I can do it anyone can.,
"If I could rate it a 0 I would, the app dosnt have all of the sets that have been made and sold...",
App crashed 5 to 6 times when I opened it. Please fix.,
A little hard to login every time I tried to log in it just wouldn't let me. Please fix this,
"very good guidance, can voom in and out , also rotate pieces.",
My 4yo just completed a 7yrs+ model with the help of this app. Brilliant!!!,
Good overall. But could you please add a wanted section to this.,
"50% of my daughter's sets will not scan the QR code or has a different set number, quite irritating.",
very difficult to download & work. PLEASE PRINT OUT THE INSTRUCTIONS!,

It hasn't the Lego who you want I tap ww2 or ww1 and it doesn't have those stuffs and when I tap tanks it has only something star wars and Lego City it's sucks please add more things,
"very buggy, always reset the manual to the first page.",
"Great app, helped me build old sets I had years ago and lost their instructions, good app!",
Just like the books and very practical on a small free surface,
"Lots of sets on there, but I have 2 that are unfound: 40077 and 40253. I want all my sets on there, can you not add them?",
"when you zoom, the images become pixilated so the lego pieces are harder to recognise",
Is this in m&L's code or is this just not so for some reason like when I updated my Mario and Luigi I connected them and for some reason instead of saying I'm a tired Mario made a t t t sound and when I woke Mario up he said hello Luigi even though they were connected and is scared of Luigi it's the same with Luigi is this in their code or is it just for an update,
"To much steps, it is boring. Especially by the wheels.",
"it is super good to have a digital instruction app, please download it now.",
"excellent, so much easier to use than the book of instructions for the kids",
"I wish it had a chart for the parts u need, but other than that it's good",
I mean it happens! Not like they laminated the instructions! Great upgrade Lego!,
Not only he best for mobile devices round & round & round & round uninstall was far easier than trying to get an account opened thank you,
very useful especially for detail and on the more complex models,
I love this App!! I've used this to figure out what sets I had when I bought a bunch of Legos in bulk from a previous owner,
Great app for finding the building instructions that you lost long ago.,
It is soooooooo easy and fun at the same time l love it and if l love it then l no that you will to,
So I like the app and all but you just had to retire the overwatch but the rest of the app is great,
Directions are easy enough to build with a little kid.,
It helped me put a wing on a lego set. I have been struggling to fix it but this helped me,
"Great idea, but it's slow to load and crashes often",
One time I had a Lego set what I could not build and then I used this app and I actually made the Lego set,
"very helpful, I'd still prefer the physical books for instructions though",
this app is honestly so cool if you like Legos especially if you lose the instructions alot like I do,
"Tried to scan the barcode from the booklet of a recent LEGO purchase but, did not work",
I have lots of Lego toys. But many of them are haven't built yet because I haven't bought any Lego toy...but it'll be fun!,
its good but the homepage crashes and all that comes up is harry potter and nothing else,
This app sucks the last 2 sets I've bought would not scan. Garbage don't download it.,
I love this game it gives out instructions to make with Lego when you are bored.,
I don't like this app because only some sets have 3d and pdf is way harder and with pdf you don't even need this app,
Search box does not work rendering the app mostly useless.,
"Wish it had more instructions for old sets, otherwise good.",
This is a good app.. But we need real Lego sets. That's the problem 😐😐😐😐. Otherwise it is a good game 🙂.,
Please Lego can you make a lego game like that but with building software it will be amazing! Please,
cabin lid is a bit flimsy in construction but otherwise great set.,
This is a pretty good app but some pecies are invisible on some parts.,
works okay so far! loading the missions for set 60353 can be slow,
really glad you created this. it helped me out a lot helping my 6 yr old put his Legos together. so thank you,
Great way to build sets and not wrinkle the instruction booklets!,
Very good my brother always broke my Lego's but I can fix it back because this app helps me for the pieces I need to make,
the only takeaway is that there's a visual glitch sometimes where the frames overlap,
this was a fun and interactive way to build the set with my granddaughter!,
It doesn't have the lego sets I need that i actually lost the instructions to if it had those it would be a 5 star but nope you guys dissapointed me.,
useful if missing instructions for their LEGO models but needs some refinements,
Great app but it doesn't allways include the pages the I hafto find the manual.,
It's very easy to use and is better then using the paper manual.,
Legos is already one of the greatest place that I've ever seen and had and this app makes it a thousand times better,
Could make the app better by adding a wishlist section as well.,
The app crashes a lot when opening the 3d instructions on my device.,
I'm Learning yet to how to build Lego but this app helps to me Build Lego now I can build Lego easily thank you. I thank's this app so. much 5 stars,

"Awesome build, enjoyed thoroughly. Another to add to my collection 😎👍",
Is only good if you need help with an old set. Very disappointing,
Buggy trash. Keeps crashing on Samsung Note 10 Plus.,
just like the book easy read and understand.,
crashes half way through using instructions and when reloaded it dosent hold your page in the instruction book,
User friendly. even better when using 3D builder not just pdf.,

I ever use thos app its so cool and whenever my dumb lego that like to pop and always pop its working and also i can create my faforite lego forms,

Love the app I just want to build my own stuff like take photos and then get ideas,
"This app is so great i really love it! I really love it ,thanks! keep up the good work LEGO® Builder!💗👏😊",
great place to organise your Lego collection and have build instructions.,
This Game is so good the graphics is so unusual its so nice and the manual is good also thats why 5 star huala,
Perfectly designed to show someone how to put a Lego model. Even my 5 year old coulbī,
Math questions every 6.3 seconds and unnecessary verification. Just trying to see my Lego collection alright?,

This is a good game but it takes alot of net and it only show me photos and doesn't make me to build,

"absolute disaster, so awkward to work with. go back to paper version",
i love it the first time i saw it i saw a 3in1 set and i was the one i had in real life! The pirate ship!,
Great for younger kids to be able to put sets together easily,
No way to quit the app. Had to reboot my device. Uninstalling.,
good that you can zoom in and its lots quicker than instructions,
was a really fun build to do the 2 in 1 El Toro Loco. Both are exciting.,
"Wow, I'm able to see sets I've had since I was a kid. This is so cool! Will you be updateding more sets? Like from older sets too?",

"The worst company I ever dealt with when it comes to customer service. I bought set number 42110 and there is a missing piece. Emailed them, got a response, and that's it. Nothing further!",
Excellent - if you don't have your instruction book - you still do!,
Perfect manual's. 3D and .pdf options are great!,
Great far easier to follow than the instruction manual,
Good build. Glad the string was longer than needed,
so tiny kids can't see how put in I zoom as big as we can wow that should didn't nope small still idk maybe rethink the zoom or picture being bigger,
go back to the old ways. printed instructions are way better,
This app is so amazing for someone like me a kid who loves legos. I love this app so much no glitches and all the legos I love the most,
Was working perfectly but I added a few sets to my list today and it had forgotten them,
App keep force closing and takes forever to finally view instructions,
App does not work. Freezes at launch.,
"Good for finding old, lost or destroid instruction booklets.",
Good views of the instructions. Also gives a few information about lego sets,
Great reference guides for build if you have lost manuals.,
"Not complete,Not all the instructions are here i wish there was a category for Lego hero factory and Lego movie 1.i hope lego updates it and adds all the instructions",
love how the app let's you search and magnify parts and layouts .,
I don't see how this could be helpful because it's not when I tried it I didn't even have the pieces and I wanted to find what I had and it didn't even work!,
I love the visual instructions that I can zoom in and move around,
nice optional way to build sets and keep track of ypur collection,

I think it's so epic to have a digital instruction for the build.,
"I love this app. it doesn't need updates, imo. I got this a few days ago and I'm so happy with this app. thank you to the developers!",
No instructions? Need app? Keeps a phone or tablet in use for hours!? Dumb.... Don't bother....,
Boring and slow my son just wants to build where are the instructions without having to do the tedious story,
great app could use a few better pics but in all made the building of my at-st easy,

why not put an accual manual inside LEGO set and force us to download a stupid mobile app? it's not like LEGO accually cates about environment or anything. it's just stupid,
"Helpful, easy and amazing are 3 words to describe this app",
I cannot scan barcode. So frustrating.,

Great but the instructions guide doesn't have bag numbers.,
It was really good because I was able to build every Lego set I needed,
Easier than using the large books included in sets.,

this is amazing I'm going to be using this to do fun projects with the Legos I already have amazing,
Now I no longer have to worry that I can never build old Lego sets.,
When I downloaded it I couldn't build because the building screen didn't appear,
Love the app! I have alot of brics and when i'm bored i go here and build!,
"Does what it needs, no ads during my build :)",

Since the latest update I can't zoom in! Please fix this then I can give 5 stars.,
it helps you if you lose the instructions you just search and there it is.,

Very swift and easy to use. Thank you Lego!,
it would be helpful if the pieces to be added were highlighted,
It's good but it lags to much and why are so many Legos retired,
Excellent app. It has 3D models of all the lego instructions,

good to help you keep track with your progress on your collection,
Very nice and handy when u lose ur instructions book!,

not all sets have the 3d models and crashes frequently for me,

this is the dumbest app and barely works. why can't we just have normal instructions...,
5 yr old Xmas gift. had tons of fun building this with the mission story.,
I love this game it comes in handy if you lose your paper. Now this is all I use,
It's easy when the instructions are missing,

The best and easy wey to build a Lego set,
"absolutely loved this build, so many little detail's",
we have a huge lego stash so having instructions to build sets we don't have is nice,
"English only, not all the detail",
app made it easier to build set for my 3year old .,
Continually crashes after pressing 2 buttons,
I think your app guys are really smart to use for people who like to build Legos for they can use their mind,
Crashes every time saying it won't open.,
"The app is pretty garbage. If you log in you lose all of your kits and they assign you an avatar that's not even your gender and you don't get to choose your username and when you go to login you better remember that username that they gave you like mine ""angelic turtle 69"" WHOEVER THAT IS otherwise you won't be able to log in and when you select that you can't remember the username they send you an email that has nothing to do with your username and doesn't even say your username. DO NOT LOG IN",
It's a bit clumsy and slow sometimes.,
Doesn't have manuals to rebuild my builds I have its just a library to see them,

"This is stupid, Lego instructions should come in a neat little booklet contained within the box with straightforward instructions to build through completion. Not this foolish app that tells you how to half build a set. I'm all for creativity but at the end when you have your left over pieces or want to reconstruct it your own way at that point.",
since last update app quickly keeps crashing on lenovo m10+ 3rd gen. tablet running android 13-t,
"Great app, all lego sets are there and I love it a lot even when I'm adult now but LEGO is life",
This app is amazing because it helps me bluid without the instruction paper if you lose it you can just get the number of the lego set amazing 😁,
It's amazing it helps for a bigger screen if you have a ipad/tablet.,
"Love the app, but I feel like some sets are missing",
a School useful I can use the instructions that came with a box I can use the app to help me make another set,

"Bloody amazing, the amount of times we lose instructions (by we I mean the kids) then it gets broken up never to be made again. We have the big ninjago mech dragon that I'd love to put back together. Great that you can scan your qr codes in which I will be doing from now on but also brilliantly that you can search for other instructions that might have been lost over time! Great idea, thanks Lego!",

این برنامه واقعا عالییییییییییییییییه,
"Man hätte erwartet, dass die App immer genau einen Schritt zur Zeit zeigt und dann Buttons für den nächsten und vorherigen Schritt hätte. Stattdessen ist es ein relativ schlechter PDF-Reader der genau die gleichen PDFs anzeigt, von denen die Papier-Anleitungen gedruckt werden. Diese PDFs sind für kleine Handybildschirme völlig ungeeignet. Es gibt nicht mal eine Möglichkeit, die PDF mit einer anderen App zu öffnen (sodass man wenigstens reinzoomen könnte).",
