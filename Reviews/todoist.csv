"I used this app for years and loved it. But recently they seem to have removed a feature that has eliminated a great deal of its function: the ability to set customized recurring reminders. This is a huge problem and has made it only half-usable. After years of being in the top percent of their users (something they also got rid of, their annual tracking), I am going to have to find a new app. It's a real shame, because I've been a premium user for so long and always really liked Todoist.",
"Update - added a star for the responsiveness of the developer. Awaiting solution rollout. I have used (& loved) Todoist for years; however, the latest update has broken something. Now the widgets constantly get stuck syncing & opening the app results in forced close. Every time. I don't even have to open the app. After reboot, I can be working on something else & my phone UI notifies me that the app has crashed. Pls fix this issue & conduct more careful testing prior to rolling out updates.",
This is my favorite to do list app! I would use motion if it were as used friendly as this app. But todoist is so much more efficient and smooth (fewer clicks to create tasks for example). And you can categorize lists but also filter those same tasks based on things like high priority or tasks that require you to leave your house. Search todoist filter/label tutorials!,
"SEIZURE RISK!!!! I have had this app for years and recommended it to many people, as it worked perfectly for me. After the latest update, however, the widget became stuck in a constant reload cycle that causes it to strobe on the screen. I immediately tried to delete the widget, but the upload cycle prevents you from being able to delete the widget as well. It almost triggered a seizure. The developers need to fix whatever mistake they made in the update ASAP.",
"I bought a new planner around the same time I started using Todoist. I used the planner for about a week. I find with Todoist, the planner is no longer useful to me. The use of tags helps me organize my work and plan my day. It's also very easy to move a task from one day to the next. In my planner, it seemed I was constantly re-writing tasks to the next day and would often lose sight of them. I also like that I can keep notes within a task. This helps me remember any progress or delays.",
"had this app for about a year. it was perfect for what i needed it for at first, but now it's practically unuseable. sections and tasks randomly duplicate and can't be deleted without also deleting unrelated items. i tried updating my app, which didn't help at all. sad to see it go, but i use my calendar every day, and the frustration of dealing with these glitches is simply not worth it!",
"It's been three months and the app still stops syncing periodically. It just hangs, as does the widget. The only way to recover is to delete the app's local data. And their support email address listed in the Play Store is still the same one that they don't actually support. I think it's time to finally give up :(",
The app is not intuitive. Subtask feature is great. Very hard to edit a task once entered. It is easier to just delete the task and re-enter it than waste the time searching for the place to edit the task. It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to move a task from the inbox to the project it needed to be in.,
"Great app. I pay for the subscription because I find the app invaluable for creating structure in my life. However, there was a recent update that changed how reminders are set, and while I do like the new feature, I wish they didn't remove the old one that allowed you to type a specific reminder with your keyboard. For example, I used to be able to type in something like, ""every other Sunday at 8am"", but now I can only select a specific date and time unless I use Todoist on my PC.",
"This app is the best todo list app. I have used this for almost 5 years I think, and it's been great for me and my husband. A todo list cannot get better than this one. However, my life circumstances have changed. This only works when I can do things, not when I want to give jobs to others. I have a kid now, and there are the family schedule, individual member's schedules, plus important things to always have in hand (notes), etc. Thank you todoist and good bye. [Edit below] We've moved to Twist",
"Really helps me keep track of things, love the integration of ""natural language"" for scheduling dates and times. If I had one complaint/suggestions it would be to make reminder notifications more noticeable. I feel I miss my reminders a lot. However, it's a small issue. Todoist has every feature I wanted from a To Do app, and more than a few I didn't know I needed.",
"I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there. There has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months, especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks, and it's been a bit frustrating there. But overall, it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions. Give it a shot!",
"So far, it's great. Just a small suggestion though: In ""comments section"" of tasks, if there are multiple images posted, and I click one to view, I should then be able to view the next one by swiping left/right. Instead I have to click off the image I'm currently on and scroll down the list of comments to find the next one. This was not intuitive to me, because in most SMS apps, whenever you view an image someone has sent you, if you swipe to the left/right, it will scroll through all images.",
"Very clean, well organized to-do list app. It makes completing tasks feel rewarding with the 'karma' feature. The 'projects' feature really helps to organize large projects into more manageable, easy to schedule tasks, which helps you to complete the larger project easily. The only thing I dislike is the fact that the free version does not come with all of the features unlocked, but this app is still my favorite to use even without the extra features.",
"I rely on this app daily for all my personal to do lists. But recent changes to functionality have made it less friendly to use than when I first got it.  For example it's much harder to add a time. Whenever I add a time to a task, it assumes I want to do it today, and I have to go back in and change it back to the original day.   Another annoyance is I can never use the word ""march"" in a task (like the March for Science) because the app thinks I mean the month. There are other words that happens with too, I can't recall them all right now.  Also like another use I don't like the circles on the left to check off the tasks, I keep deleting them accidentally.",
"Awesome but not perfect. Best I've found so far, and I've tried a ton. With a lot of my workflow being email/outlook based, the plug-in is incredibly helpful. It's a little complex, but with great power comes a bit of learning curve. I have an Android phone, an iPad, and work in Windows so the cross platform nature is key for me. Missing a couple things I think are key like being able to enter a completed date in the past (yesterday at least). I'm getting far more done using the app.",
I love this app and I count on it to keep me organized but am not crazy about the latest update. I love that my list appears larger and easier to read but I don't like how it automatically deletes it when an item is hit. I've accidently lost items on my grocery list several times. It has left me feeling less secure that I've crossed everything off my list.,
"Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either. So, no backward search for the events, calendar sharing and other integrations. Well, task and project-wise, this is a powerhouse! Much more simple and well designed than Google Keep I've been using for years.",
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first.",
"It's a great app, but just like any organization app, you have to meet it halfway with actual effort. If you don't actually intend to complete the work, don't kid yourself by getting the app. I only wish it included a calendar that displayed events in chronological order along with the list of events in bullet point format and that it sent reminders of events. I'm very picky about apps, but this one is actually nice.",
"Best to do list I've found. I used to use Trello but it didn't work for me. This does everything Trello didn't. Love the Inbox and how i can access it from a widget on my phone with one press. Also i have the other widget that shows my list of choice. I love how you can schedule items just by typing when you want them, even if it repeats. It's a very smooth interface. A few of the premium features would be really nice to have. It's tempting but i don't like recurring fees. I'd rather pay once.",
"Very good to do list app! Looks nice, easy to create new tasks with the automatic detection of dates, times, priorities, and topic. Does not show ads and is pretty generous with the free version. My only issue so far has been occasional desync between devices (can be solved by logging out and logging back in). Also, note that the free version doesn't allow you to set reminders.",
"Seems like a pretty cool app, I like how quick it is to set up tasks. Would be great for some people's situations, but since I'm looking for something for personal use and have no need for additional projects, larger files (or files in general), or filters it is a waste of money to pay a monthly subscription just to be able to set up any reminders at all. Guess I'm back to my search for a good todo list app...",
"Mostly pros but one big con.. Absolutely love this app. It is really is user friendly and has helped me so much with organizing my life. One big con though is I had a big issue with the Google calendar integration. I had to disconnect it as it messed up my calendar and I lost a bunch of data that I needed to reenter. Luckily, it was uploaded to todoist so I didn't have to hunt for it. I really hope they fix that issue.",
"I've been using todoist for years now and it's nice being able to access my list from my phone or computer. Bad news is that with the latest update, the ""add task"" widget won't work. It said the app doesn't exist, so I tried to remove the widget and place it again, but it makes the Home UI crash every time. It did the same thing on my husband's phone.",
"Updated review to 4 stars from 1. The usability was very poor, but I looked online, and on youtube and eventually solved main problem. It was that when I made subtasks in Today view, they remained as original, but also in the new list as well (subtasked only there)! So I had a lot of duplicates. I stand by my earlier assertion that this is very poor usability from a new user's point of view. Also, I upgraded to premium and it is annoying that they charge 30 dollars up front (annual), instead of a reasonable monthly charge. However it is proving helpful and I look forward to future changes as well. Original review: Poorly designed, subtasks listed in a nonsensical manner. Doing basic things such as un-checking items a hassle.",
"I love this app! I've tried a few other task list type applications, but this one really takes the cake! Their format is very flexible and has all the basics offered for free...except reminders. Data syncs well across devices, you can create subprojects, stacked task lists, and many other useful features! I check Todoist throughout my day and it's working well for me so far. If you need reminders, check out their premium version! It has plenty of features that are actually worth paying for. ;)",
"Reliable, flexible, easy to use. I have more flexibility in organizing my to-do list the way I want to see it, and still use GTD. Only minor drawback: wish there was another way to set repeating tasks other than putting it into words. Putting it into words might seem easier than the menus seen om most other To Do apps, but you have to put the words in a precise way and even then it might still take a few tries before Todoist picks up the repeat request.",
"Simply brilliant. Everything you could want. Thoughtfulness is the word that comes to mind whenever I discover a new feature. Some awesome big features like location reminders and integrations, and tons of clever little features too. free version has a respectable collection of features that don't let you down, but I'm seriously considering getting the premium version.",
"this app has been great for keeping track of what I have to do each day. it conveniently syncs on all of my devices so it's always up to date no matter where I am and what device I'm using. it's easy and satisfying to mark something as ""complete"". it reminds you when you have overdue tasks, but gives you the option to quickly reschedule them to another time so you dont feel guilty. all in all, it's a great app that does exactly what it needs to do! highly recommended!",
"So I'm moving over to this app from TickTick because I like how it looks. I believe ticktick is more condusive to time management, but Todoist seems like the better overall to-do list app. The big problem I am having is stability. When trying to create a label within a to-do, it crashes. I've also experienced crashes when switching projects. I subscribed thinking the $8 extra would be a better experience, but so far I'm a bit concerned. I'll give the app a few weeks before giving up.",
"I recently moved from a job where I utilized Microsoft Outlook's tasks. I struggled to find an app that could perform as well as Outlook. This app does everything and more! On PC...I love the predictive typing, Google Chrome attachment, flagging emails, typing notes, attaching files, reminders, and more. And it syncs across all my devices. On the app I love how fluid it is. It is so easy to use! After trying literally almost every to do app out there, this one gets my five stars! I have tried Google Tasks, Microsoft tasks, Wunderlist, Any.do, and many more. I've even paid for a majority of them. This one is well worth the money!",
"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.",
"Love the minimalist nature of Todoist. It's exactly the right number of features. Inbox, projects, quick add tasks with keyword support - all great features that make the app quick and easy to use. Too many other to-do apps are overly complicated. This is by far the best one I've come across. (Free version, single user.)",
"It is a great to do app that takes a little while to find all the customization possibilities for, but when you do it works wonderfully, and even the free version is clean with no ads as I'm writing this. The biggest change I'd like to see is the ability to visualize progress through goals, daily tasks and overall projects in a more helpful way that shows the percent progress made in each priority level.",
"I had been looking for a to do list app with projects and connection to my calendar. There's a lot of stuff out there, but for some reason I fell in love with todoist. I saw it in a few YouTube videos and tried it out for myself and it has worked flawlessly. Two of my favorite features are projects and synchronization of my calendar and todoist on both sides. So if I add something to todoist, it gets added to my calendar and vice versa. Awesome, awesome utility!",
"Best GTD app. If you are building a list system based on David Allen's book getting things done, I think this is absolutely the best app to use for that. I have had GTD systems on Evernote, Onenote, Microsoft to do, and a paper notebook, and this is by far the best in almost every way. It's easy to use, has no bugs, has a bunch of great bells and whistles, and it syncs seamlessly across all platforms. The user experience is great too. It draws me in to my lists, rather than repelling me.",
"Taking off a star because I'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update. I'm not a fan of having to click the drop-down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once. Especially because the task selection mode expires each time I make a single change to the selected tasks, requiring me to then go into the drop-down menu again to and then re-select all of the tasks I just selected. I really liked before how I could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks. I know this change was made to allow easy re-ordering of tasks, although I don't find this particularly helpful because I don't typically re-order my tasks. I would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once.",
"Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.",
"After trying *so* many different time management apps (even the $200/yr ones), this one the best. I love that the date you type in the add task bar automatically assigns it to the date. You can set events, tasks, and reminders all with voice to text while driving! The only thing I'd *love* is a more conventional ""calendar"" view where I can easily see what's in store for the month with one glance. Keep up the good work!",
"The app looked very promising, but there were too many ""Upgrade to premium"" notifications when initially clicking through the app. From what I saw, I probably would have paid for a year if I was able to try out the fill app first. Instead, I got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications. For these reasons, 3 stars and lost buisness.",
"This app has improved my life so much. It's true that once I get the tasks written down, it clears my head for better management of the rest of my day/responsibilities. I can either make a list of things to do in general or assign tasks to certain days/times. I can make different lists for different projects. I REALLY ❤️ the homescreen widget that I see whenever I check my phone. Some features you can choose to pay for, but the free version has enough features to do what I need. Never deleting!",
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!",
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.",
Perfect for organizing big life goals and daily tasks all in one. I've been using the pro version for 5 years now. I love how easy it is to organize tasks within one another and i use the scheduling features to their fullest extent. I use it on all my devices. Works well with small teams too. Now i never worry about losing an idea or missing a task. It's all written down forever and I never have to worry about what I forgot.,
"Love this app! It's easy to use, and once you get used to it, it gets even easier. It's the first app I've ever actually stuck to, because of its goal setting. It gives ""Karma"" points for successfully marking things off, and makes me want to stick with it. I emailed the developers with a question just one time, and they were quick and helpful with their response. The Premium version is worth every penny!",
"Incredibly convenient and simple, but I hope that the feature to attach photos (from your gallery or straight from your camera), links, and documents can be without the premium. Just a really naive wish, coming from a student. Other than that,  this app is really good, and its customer service is as admirable. Good job!",
"This is a great to-do app. The interface is easy to use and looks great. Natural language scheduling works really well. ToDoist is supported on a wide variety of platforms. This includes Android and IOS. I really like that there is a phone app and web browser access. You can share projects with other users. Things to note: if you want to schedule your day, you can set due dates and time but you are better served using a calendar app. ToDoist isn't well suited for recurring checklists.",
"This is by far the best tasking app out there. As someone who struggles with ADHD, this has been a lifesaver. It can sync with calendars, remind you of things based on location or time, and lots of other cool things. The interface is intuitive and tasks can be as simple or as detailed as needed. Additionally, it can work as a kanban board and be used among teams if needed. It works on and syncs across web, mobile, even my smart watch. Could not recommend more.",
This is a great system! I'm pretty disorganized so I'm of the opinion that if it works for me and the mess of my life that exists it must work for everybody. The only thing it needs is an inbuilt monthly calendar. PARTICULARLY for events/appointments. Also while I am aware that reminders are for premium only (and as such are not a factor for losing a star) i am slightly unsure whether or not the reminder works like an alarm system where it will buzz at the time that you have set for the event.,
"One of the most useful apps I've ever used. It has a charming, professional interface that takes to-do lists to another level. For someone whose life runs on systems, this is imperative to making sure my day gets done. It has saved me many times and offers some nice extra features with a premium subscription that is very helpful but possibly not necessary for everyone. I could go on but I'll just say try it and make your own conclusions.",
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? The old widget could do things the app couldn't, and can't. Give it back! Matters have improved, though - it's now easy to open the app from the new widget.",
"It's a fine task manager app, a little bit hard to get at first with the weird natural language based task creation, but if you're willing to put in the effort it's pretty intuitive. The one big deal breaker for me is that if you have a daily recurring task it becomes overdue at midnight. If you tap it complete after midnight, it completes it for the next day which ends up with you missing a day unless you remember to do it on your own or manually set the next recurrence to today.",
"I use this app everyday at work--it's a great app with lots of options for keeping tasks organized. However, the latest update seems to have introduced a bug. Sometimes, while adding sub-tasks to a task, the app will auto-complete everything. All sub-tasks will simultaneously mark themselves as completed, and the only way to undo it is to go back and uncheck them one by one. Sometimes the cursor will also skip to the ""Comments"" box while in the middle of writing a sub-task.",
"This app has helped me re-establish good habits, remember things when I couldn't afford to forget (very forgetful person) and conquer my procrastination bit by bit. The slightly gamified interface helps to make the app fun, and more personalized for me. I do wish it were a little more like a game, some level-ups and rewards wouldn't hurt. Overall, very useful and encouraging. Doesn't feel clingy or noisy.",
"This is my dream personal planning app. I love the design, it looks and feels great to use. It's simple and intuitive but also very powerful. There any plenty of ways to group tasks, and the filters are very powerful for viewing them however you want. And it's fully featured. It has collaboration, a great widget, and integrations with a lot of other apps, including Google Assistant.",
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.",
"A few days in and so far so good. Definitely has a few non-intuitive functions. Setting custom reminders is weird...a pop-up should just appear to select a date and time, but instead you type it in then it tries to interpret what you type, then you select it if it is right. Very convoluted. Finally found the task completion statistics. Its next to your profile icon/picture when clicking on the three horizontal lines top left. Small circle with squiggly arrow with some numbers next to it.",
"What is the point of a ""To Do"" list without reminders? Nope, you don't get a notification reminder unless you pay for premium, you can't even try it to see if it will work better than Microsoft To-Do (which can't stay running for anything). Without notifications/alarms I can make a ""To Do"" list using a notebook & pen or the paper calendar I have on my fridge! The whole point of searching for a useful app is to use modern features, like reminders/alarms & custom days, dates, & times.",
"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works.",
"To start, notifications shouldn't be a premium feature. The main reason I want a to-do list on my phone is so I can get more from it, including reminders. Second, even the free features didn't function as the guide said they would. I tried to add a recurring task for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as per the instructions, but it wouldn't even do that. Edit2: sent image confirming smart recog is on, but you can't screenshot with the keyboard on and cannot turn keyboard off while setting time.",
"Great to-do list app, I just wish the task widget was more responsive. It's a bit annoying to tap a task to check it off, it takes a second to actually check off, and then wait several more seconds for the list to refresh before you can interact with anything else. I primarily use the widget to interact with the app, so the way that functions is very important to me.",
"No easy way to view your completed tasks. Everything else about this app is great, but this one missing feature is a HUGE dealbreaker. For 90% of people, the benefit of a todo list is to see what you have done easily, and get a sense of achievement from it. If they added that feature I'd give it 5 stars, but I find this app unusable without this feature.",
The app itself is good but the voice integration on Android is not intuitive nor powerful. I have to jump through several hoops to get my task logged and it often ends up wrong. This might be an issue with Google as well. But I am looking for a quick way to get tasks logged when I can't type. Instead I find my self fumbling to press buttons again...,
"Hi, The app's interface and usability is pretty good. But the time zone feature has some bugs. If I set a different time zone on my device and a different one within the app, it causes problems. I was hoping that you guys could overcome those. It would help a lot of students stuck with asynchronous learning and online classes 🤒🥲.",
"Great todo app with minimalistic UI, however there is a bit of missing potential. The app is fairly full of features, however for key things like notifications you aren't given many settings to customize them. Another example is you can't have tasks auto-scheduled based on the project it is in or the labels it has. I paid for a subscription (only $4) to test out labels and everything this app and the desktop version offered and I was a bit underwhelmed by the lack of automation features.",
"Easy to use. It takes a second to get used to controls but then it super easy. I use the widget to add task throughout the day. My list stays condensed in my notifications. Only when I click on it, does it show me everything on my list. I love this app because it helps me remember things, and helps me stay on track when I have a million things going at once (I'm a Mom, Wife and Student).",
"Overall, the interface is just ok. It's difficult to sometimes figure out where to type things to add the event to your list and changing the date on an event can be annoying as well. Then you have to pay to even set a reminder alarm... But it functions well and is a fairly straightforward layout.",
It does what it needs to. I just wish instead of email notifications when things were over due that I would get push notifications instead. I think it is hard to balance having a free tool and a paid version for something like this and the free version gives you the bare minimum. I dont know how the paid version would provide me with any better service as an individual than the free version aside from push notifications.,
Love this app! started with the free version and upgraded right away. It really helped me get my life and schedule under control when I started my business. I am still learning some of the more advanced ways to use it and find it gets more and more helpful with time. I love that i can send emails directly to it and make them into tasks and also i totally get into tracking my progress and getting points! im a geek like that LoL,
"I have been on a mission to find a to-do list that syncs well between my phone, smartwatch, and google calendar. I have tried just about every to-do list out there and in some aspect, every single one of them fell short. I was about to give up hope when I came upon this app! Thanks to this app, I am now the organized and productive person that I always knew I could be but never could find the right tool to make it happen!! Thank you!!! ❤️",
"I love the app. I just wish there was an option for a one time payment for premium. I have too many subscriptions, and I always cancel new subscriptions in a short amount of time because I find that I don't use the app enough to pay monthly or yearly. The apps that I can pay once for premium are the apps I usually stick with. I use this a lot for tracking my spending and budget, so a subscription is kind of counter intuitive.",
"I am a fan of GTD which is really just a system of lists. I have tried all the big name task managers out there. Todoist is by far my favorite. Once you catch on to the natural language processing it is so easy to record everything that comes to mind in the ""In"" box then do a review later to decide what to do. Since I always have my phone I use the notification bar icon to record stuff as I think of it. Nothing ever gets lost or forgotten. It is wondeful to have a septem you can depend on!",
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it.",
"Truly my favorite to-do list app I've ever tried. My one small quibble is that it always has trouble accepting multiple keywords, for example if it's Monday and I need to set up an items that is weekly on Tuesdays, I can't just type ""Tuesday weekly"" but have to go tinker around in the settings. I'd also like more customization over the look, with fonts and colors.",
"I really like this app and use it everyday. However, these new Pop Ups that come out of nowhere congratulating me on checking off tasks are incredibly annoying. I don't need a digital pat on the back. Maybe some people like that and that's great. Personally, I just want to keep checking off tasks or looking at what's next to do and these pop ups just get in the way of that and irritate me. Can you please make it so I can turn them off? I've searched the settings and I can't find it anywhere.",
"Newest update completely renders filters and upcoming useless. Just a white screen. Testing before launching changes obviously didn't happen. Edit: the newest update renders the app functional. However, it is still very glitchy. Upon selecting filters, the view is not updated until you scroll the screen. And filter names are truncated to 2 or 3 letters.",
"The perfect todo app. It's so easy and quick to set up really powerful filters and workflows to make sure you're focusing on the tasks that matter most. Not to mention the performance and UX is super snappy, so you can note, organize, and check off tasks without wasting time you could spend getting things done fumbling with the app.",
"This little app got me through my finals this quarter. The simplicity and variety of scheduling options makes it very useful. At first I thought premium was dumb and I wouldn't need it, but they offered a free 30 day trial without having to add my credit card and I quickly got addicted. Once the 30 day trial was over I couldn't go back so I paid the 36$ year which I would say is extremely reasonably priced. Very recommended, especially for school. Helped me stay on track and never miss any hmwk",
"It's good, but the layout requires an extra click to get to the calendar week view, and that's my favorite view because I want todoist to be my weekly planner. If I have to click into the app, click the side bar, and then click into the calendar view, it's too much work. Those three views (today, calendar view, etc) I would like clickable like at the bottom always, or the ability to swipe between the views.",
"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget. These are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule. The widget could be improved, otherwise the app is great.",
"Fantastic app. I needed something like this to improve my productivity with reminders for work, and this app delivers more with cool features like projects, tags, priorities, comments, and so much more. The smart-typing and interpretation of text is amazing to set specific dates and tags just by typing, it really speeds up the process of creating tasks, which makes it easier to use and way more functional. I highly recommend the app, and the unlocked subscription fee is incredibly reasonable!",
"This app is easy to learn and use, and yet so powerful. It has been extremely robust and supports every common desktop and mobile platform. Adding a task with natural language scheduling is such a breeze! It also supports queries to view your tasks in many different ways. The free version is complete and usable, with no ads! But I'm seriously considering upgrading to pro just to support these developers. It takes a lot of skill and dedication to make an app this robust and well designed.",
"I used Apple Reminders for a while until I switched ecosystems. You have to pay to get the most out of it, but it's worth it to me. Excellent integration with Google Calendar and it works on all my platforms (Windows, Android, and Chromebook). Helps out a lot. Not the best voice assistant integration, but still great!",
"So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.",
"Over time I've tried a lot of to-do list apps. Todoist has long been one I've come back to over and over and finally, I've settled on it as my favorite. During the past few years Todoist has helped me stay focused to grow my freelance business. It's also helped me when I get anxious and overwhelmed. I can easily set my daily list to just a few manageable tasks and move things to the back burner or ""inbox"". I love Todoist and its Getting Things Done methodology.",
"Very positive so far. Installed the app about a week ago and it took a couple of days before I felt entirely comfortable with it. The learning curve is very modest overall, it's one the few to-do list applications that's truly multiplatform. It have it installed on my iPad, Windows PC and Android phone (OK already! I kno6, and so far it has performed brilliantly. I'll update this eval if I run into any issues. but so far so good. Highly recommended...",
A little difficult to get the hang of. But all in all a great app. Only issue I'm having is that my recurring subtasks show up twice on my daily checklist which clutters up the list. The duplicates also appear outside the main task so I can't unexpand them to clear up the clutter. Other than that everything works well so far.,
There are so many to do apps out there and so many comparison articles it was difficult to even choose one. I tried several and this one definitely seemed like the best so I purchased the premium version and it is great. Save yourself some time and aggravation just get this one. Try the free version first. The premium cost is $3 per month subscription bille yearly for $36 and although there is no free trial of the premium version you do have 30 days for a refund if you don't like it but you will.,
"Awesome App overall. I like how you can create separate lists for different categories. However I'd appreciate if the subtasks could be reworked to allow for the main tasks and the subtasks to be marked as completed separately. The reason I use subtasks in the first place is because they're related to my main task, yet I need to complete them at different times than the main task. Right now if I mark one as complete, the whole thing is marked as complete, which defeats the purpose.",
"Very fun and intuitive app! Completing a task is rewarding, and the app is very good at notifying me of my tasks for the day. It is also great at organizing my tasks, and I love the option of adding a task to the Inbox - a great way to still add something without the immediate need to file it under a category. One issue I have is on Wear OS: on my Fossil Gen 6 (Wear OS 2), scrolling with the rotating crown causes a frenzy of vibration and the app to freeze. Please fix this!",
"I got lucky that this is the first to-do list app I have ever used. It is excellent in every way! It allows you to add items, prioritize items, move items around on your list, categorize items, and has multiple inboxes all with the free version. More options are available for the premium version if you need them.",
"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that.",
"I adore this app. I type in everything I need to get done, then sort it all by date and priority. At the beginning of the day, I pick three tasks to rate as priority one. At the end of the day, I can easily postpone tasks I didn't accomplish without feeling bad. I feel organized, and like I can finally tackle my seemingly endless to-do list in a logical manner.",
Its good. WAY better than when I first tried it. The features are excellent. Esp because I use it mainlie for life stuff and to get the functionality it offers most productivity apps make you pay a per user fee. I've tried about 9 in the past year and a half so im prettie confident in the quality of Todoist. Runner up Asana as a for instance doesn't automatically remove completed tasks on their free version... bananas.,
"So-so app. The way to move a task to a different Project from the search results is obscure — as described in the developer's response here, it requires scrolling a list that shows no visible indication it can be scrolled. In other contexts, swiping the task right provides a Move option; but, as is common with Microsoft, the way to move a task in the search results doesn't match how it works in other contexts, and isn't obvious at all.",
"I recently completed the forced upgrade for the app, and now it doesn't work consistently.....repeatedly, the app has frozen up completely and none of my tasks appear. If I'm able to get it working again (aftet multiple restarts), all the changes i made in recent sessions are gone. It worked perfectly before. I'm SO annoyed! I've been a todoist user for years, but if this isn't fixed, I'll switch to something that works consistently (already made that switch, for work projects).",
"Absolutely love this app because this is a digital version of how I've always organically done it. Can assign things to projects or labels. Have due dates and repeating events but also no dates if you want! Love how the website/desktop version is so similar to the app that navigating between the two is a breeze In terms of minor changes I'd like to be able to repeat but ""every other day"" or ""every monday, Tuesday, and Thursday"" for semi regular events/chores/tasks. Overall 10/10",
"I'm an OCD business owner and this app is perfect for me. If you want clean widgets on your home screen for quick and easy tasks and goal setting this app beats all the others. I personally wasted 12 hours researching and playing around with the task and to do apps and these guys take the cake. Great UI, great customizability, not too try hard. I love how you can create lists for different things and set different categories on the same list so you don't have to hit back when swapping lists.",
"You don't have to pay for Todoist for it to be useful. At its core it is a digital to do list with flexibility for whatever you want to throw at it. You can schedule recurring routines easily, break down large projects into smaller subtasks and organize it all to your liking. I use Todoist as a big picture planner. The desktop program is what I use for weekly planning and task input. But when I'm out in the world making it happen the phone app is just as valuable. I say give it a try!",
Prepare to pay. It looks like a very useful app if you pay for it. The basic features I have access to for free are good; easy to use & had a nice front end user experience. I can't give 5 stars because I'm not going to pay to access the extra features when I can use Samsung Notes for free for the same basic abilities. I don't need it bad enough to pay.,
"The repeat option is nonexist. The only time its allowed me to repeat a task is ""every month"". At first I thought ""every two weeks"" might be too confusing for it but I tried ""every week"" and ""every day"" and it doesn't pop up except for that first day. Also the fact that it often lists the scheduled date as ""today"" despite me not yet picking a date is stupid, and it resets to ""today"" automatically when I try to edit the task in any way (like change the name). It doesn't make any sense!",
"Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.",
"I really like this app and the smart tags feature of being able to tag it on a project which is super quick. You can also use boards like in Trello. A lot of really great functionality in this app. The only issues I've had is syncing between desktop app and phone a few times, but once I logged out and back in on app it synced my tasks so hopefully that will get fixed soon. I haven't tried doing that again, but I will soon.",
"Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!",
This thing just keeps getting better and better. These guys are doing great. I loved the google calendar integration and discovered to my delight today that since its inception it has been improved on and I can now add a separate calendar integration per list for those few lists that need it. Sync is instant and oh so helpful. Thanks a lot guys!,
"My experience has been hit or miss. After listening to the developer on the YNAB podcast recently, with my new role in IT as a Solutions Architect, there is immense value in a proper organization and to do list application, especially task boards. Paid for premium. Unfortunately, when clicking a label in the left nav in favorites, it does nothing and you're still left viewing the Inbox, Today or Upcoming pane you were in. It doesn't filter or behave as it should. Edit: I was doing it wrong!",
Pros: Can add two levels of subtasks to tasks. Four priority levels. Can drag tasks up and down to prioritize them further. Any number of color coded custom labels can be added to each task. Dark theme available. Cons: NO reminders without paying every month which is pretty bad. I understand charging for premium features but reminders on a task manager is one of the most basic features possible. Can't find a way to backup. *Also: stop deleting my reviews...,
Genuinely out of this world. This app goes above and beyond in creating a seamless organising system that really allows you to get your mind off and scribble as many thoughts as possible and then organise them. And it tracks it perfectly. It syncs with the PC version excellently and rewards you for every task done making you feel the progress and it gives you many metrics to further illustrate how much you've done in a short period of time. One of the best out there 👍,
I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.,
"It's okay. I thought it would be much better for tracking recurring tasks. Once you miss a task, it just says overdue. Even if it happens multiple times a day, you won't be getting reminded again. Not worth paying for pro with notifications if this is how it works. I paid for a year but I won't be renewing if this doesn't change.",
"Awesome! Best of all worlds. Inbox for ideas that doesn't clutter priority items to get done. Easy scheduling and projects with multiple layers of sub projects. Easy to hide sub projects and assign to different days. Easy to tag, prioritize, sort, etc. In the past, I would use a list, it would get cluttered and overwhelming, then I would start a whole new list in defeat. With Todoist, I actually get to the end of my list, before the end of the day.",
I almost went with TickTick because of the calendar within the app and the habits feature. But in the end I just couldn't pass up the level of organization that Todoist offers. I have ADHD and I really need visuals to get through my days. This app seems to work well with how I think. I feel good at the end of the day when I can clear out my tasks. The integration with Google calendar is useful for planning my days. I will most likely pay for premium.,
"I'm not 100% happy with how it's set up, but it's working well enough to help keep me organized. Since it's a web based app, I can still access my info when my phone acts up, and I won't lose all my data again the next time my phone craps out and I have to do a factory reset. My main complaint is that it doesn't work exactly the same as the other app that I'm already used to, but that one didn't reliably back up and I lost my data one too many times. I'll get used to this one.",
"Todoist is an excellent app with excellent support. I use Todoist to help stay on top of the flow of information coming at me, have and also utilized the repeating task function for regular checklist items. I also love using the labels for contextual tasks, like emails, calls, errands, at home, at computer, etc. It's been a game changer in my ability to be productive and efficient. Todoist support is awesome, too. If you're looking to become more productive and retain a sense of control over the things you are (and are not) doing, HIGHLY recommend this app! I also recommend reading GTD.",
"Worthless app. Have been using the premium version for 6 months now, and much preferred the previous free version from over a year ago that had the auto reschedule function in case you actually try to intentionally write down more than you can accomplish in a day to make sure things don't fall through the crack. Wish I had known thay feature was removed before purchasing, but without it, it's actually more work than just writing it as a simple checklist.",
"Very handy app. They are tons of tips and tutorials about how to get it to practically sit up and roll over. Really does help with productivity. Works with Alexa for the most part too. Updated now that I've used it for a while. I have the Pro version now, and it's very handy, especially for looking back at completed tasks. I know there are lots of tricks I don't know yet, but I do recommend this product.",
"It is an effective todo app with some unique and useful features. Paying $3/month for the premium subscription might be worth it...I'm still deciding on this app vs Wunderlist, the one I've used previously. Predictive typing for things like ""by today at 5pm"" is great but the free version has limited capabilities with reminders. Happily, no ads. It works nice between multiple platforms which is essential, especially since you can key things in on the PC VERY quickly. Karma points help motivate.",
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",
I appreciate how easy it is to create and modify a To-Do List. The ability to group multiple Lists under a Project Title is very useful. I also like the Sub-Task feature which allows me to add details to a specific Task. Another feature that I found to be helpful is the email notifications that monitor my scheduled Tasks. The Application feature set is well thought out. I would recommend this application to anyone who needs an organizational tool to help them be more productive.,
I set multiple test reminders to see what kind of notification I'd receive and I haven't gotten a single one. I checked permissions and settings to make sure nothing turned off by default. I set a few at different times for reminders and they all passed by with nothing. No push or emails or anything. I can't exactly recommend using a reminder app that doesn't actually give you reminders.,
"Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.",
"I really like this app... It's unique in that the commands are very simple and it can recognize plain-text times and dates, and organizing each entry into sections, or ""projects"" is easy. I would recommend setting up the app online or on a computer because managing projects and sub-projects is difficult within the app. My one regret is that the app is broken up into calendar days. I, and a few others don't necessarily consider it ""tomorrow"" until I've gone to sleep and woken up the next day. I'll have a daily task, like reading, that can float through my day... often times I'll get it done in the might before I go to bed, other times it'll happen in the afternoon when I have free time. I can schedule my reading task daily, but if I complete the task at 12 AM on the night of November 1st, it counts as ""tomorrow"" and won't automatically reappear until November 3rd. I propose that Todoist have a night-owl setting, in which we late-nighters can define when our days end. I don't want my reading to count for November 2 if I'm completing the task for November 1 before I've gone to sleep. I don't want Todoist to skip that task to November 3 even if it is the next calendar day because I won't have done my reading for November 2. I wish that we would be able to define our 24 hour period as one day instead of solely relying on Calendar dates.",
"I occasionally check out other list tools, buy come back to this one. The full UI works great, but the widget doesn't work that well on Android 12 - it behaves far better on my tablet stuck on Android 10. On my phone it often double/triple reloads, and some reloads just spin until opening the app. Plus, either due to that or having a smaller phone, I mostly fail trying to mark the completion bubble. bubble.",
"My experience with Todoist has been great. It has helped me keep track of all my college assignments that I must complete. It's also helpful that it reminds you when things are overdue. Making the list is very simple as well. All you do is press the + button, type the thing you need to do, press the > button, and BAM! you're all set.",
"This app is my lifeline but it's insanely buggy the past couple weeks, and keeps crashing. Always has had a problem syncing with browser extensions as well. Either browser or the app won't update globally. Usually it's the browser that won't but lately the app won't update and the browser extensions are the only ones working properly. Please help fix this todoist! All the typical troubleshooting is not helping. 2.14 edit back up to 5 stars - update fixed! Woohoo 🙌🎉",
"I've tried multiple to-do list organizer applications and have found Todoist to be the best for me. Sync was a big problem cross platform for me even using Microsoft's To-Do. I'd create my lists ans tasks on my PC and then go to pull them up on my phone when on the job site onky to find nothing I had entered was there. This happened time and time again. so began my search and I found Todoist. It is fast, easy to organize. You can tag, prioritize, add photos. I really like the karma too!",
"Best task manager I have EVER used. Much more usable than most gamified task managers, but still has a nice experiemce point and goal mechanic. Completely intuitive. Hotkeys make it fast and easy to input tasks, and having multiple project lists . My favorite feature is how I can dump an entire semester's worth of homework in my todo list at once, not get overwhelmed, and know that it will show up in my daily task list right on time. I recommend this so often.",
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.,
decent app for phone use although there are better options that offer more features for free if you strictly want to use only one phone. what makes this stand out is the integration with other devices such as android wear which allows you to add and complete tasks from your watch and easily see the next task you need to complete.,
"i love this app very much! its organization is so efficient and i love how you can automate recurring tasks and the projects are so amazing! will be looking into possibly getting premium. my only thing is i wish there was more graphics/fonts/theme options. I understand simplicity is the premise, but I like having a pretty schedule or at least a personal looking one. even if not, a pink theme for premium please 😭 but other than that it is a fantastic app!!",
"After turning off *all* of the notifications, it's exactly the To Do app *I* need. Instead of sixty sheets of paper with projects I'm working on or was working on or ideas for art or groceries or whatever! I have this. I've been using it about a week, and so far, I think it's working out rather well.",
"The best feature is detecting date and time while typing. Free version is very good and doesn't annoyingly pester you with popup ads. I wish I could individually buy features like themes, but it is a subscription... If you're not too crazy about tagging and mostly about speed and efficiency, this free app is for you.",
"Downloaded the app so I could have a widget with my list on my home screen. shortly thereafter, tney added checkboxes, which can't be turned off, making it easy to accidentally ""complete"" a task on the widget. And unlike when you have the app open, this can't be undone. It was good when I downloaded it, but is now completely useless.",
"Pretty neat app, very simple. When you input tasks (I do it via voice input), you can simply add little details like ""change tires next Monday"" and it will automatically add it to monday. it parses your details bout very well. you can even add times and I dont even KNOW what else it could do. Great app! Also, i have different projects which have individual tasks, very organized.",
"User friendly but very glitchy. Drag and drop new task feature won't work if too close to bottom of screen. Selecting multiple tasks only highlights the first one. When collapsing groups of tasks, app sometimes freezes. When re-ordering tasks, the app will sometimes (15% of the time) move the task back to where it originally was. ""Reordered"" msg doesn't auto-disappear. I frequently restart the app to get past glitches. Using on Samsung Galaxy S8 Android 9 Pie.",
"Not very impressed with the app. The repeating task function in not intuitive like other scheduling apps which will have a ""repeat every"" field. The Watch part of the app (which I got it for) is wonky. Every time I open the app it spams asking for location permission (which I have no intention of using). It says I have 8 tasks to do today, but there is only 1 when I click on it. Also it adds a bunch of junk tasks when you first start it.",
"Love this app. I have debilitating ADHD (if you know, you know) and this app makes my life manageable. Filters and priority settings keep to do lists from getting scrambled and overwhelming. For example, I use the urgent/important paradigm for priority setting, and the filters are perfect. Integrate with Google calendar. Project management with subtasks. If you have executive dysfunction, even the free version of this is a life saver. Also desktop is Linux compatible so that's a huge plus for me",
"It looks nice, but a couple issues making it not great for repeated tasks. 1. When a task is overdue (either missed or forgot to check off), there's no way to check off that iteration or mark as missed, checking off the overdue one checks off the next iteration. 2. The widget has no way to apply both ""Today"" and a project filter. 3. No way to change what to consider start of day to be. A lot of my tasks personally I do around midnight, so it's impossible to setup for that.",
Used to be simple well organized app. Latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your data.... Most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared. For some reason timed ones seemed to stick around... Completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in. If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks. They claim all your information is backed up securely but when I asked for my completed tasks they were not able to provide my attachments.,
"By far the best task management app I've ever used. Supports labels, projects, due dates, has reliable notifications, a gamification system, a great interface, support for every major OS.. I couldn't be more satisfied. The integration with Google Home is less than ideal, but that is a small complaint.",
I really wanted to like this app but there is no way to order items on todo lists. I have at this point had to reorder all of my items over 10 times for each because when u use the drag and drop menu to change the order it doesn't save it permanently there is also no way to sort your todo lists by date because I figured if I input a deadline for each item it would show me what I had to do with the one due the soonest at the top but no. I wish there were more ways to sort or at least filter date,
Great app and gets more helpful the more you use it to keep.track of your tasks. Works across multiple devices. It offers a good way tp organize your tasks without an cluttered interface. One feature i would like is the ability to.have asporational tasks that do not count for or against your karma score ie things that you can do if you have time but no problem if they dont get done. This app.has definitely changed my life for the better.,
"Great for organizing tasks, assigning to others, creating subtasks and categories. However, my problem keeping me from coming back is my inability to check off a task once it's complete. if I don't check off the subtask, I don't move on to the next subtask, and that task can get forgotten (or worse yet, burdens my mind with the anxiety of all I have yet to accomplish). Home pages don't highlight what I need to do well, reminders pile on, and it get as cluttered as my mind once again.",
"Absolutely love this app. So easy to add and organize to-do items, prioritize tasks, manage projects. Works well everywhere. Technically, it's not supposed to be compatible with my Windows 10 64-bit version, but I use it there anyway, and it works most days. Totally worth the cost for the Pro version. I'd be far less productive without it.",
"It has the ability to add sub-tasks to sub-tasks, making the actual lists I create more helpful, y'all HAD a leg-up on Google, unfortunately there is no option to keep tasks/sub-tasks in a specific order, so the entirety of my list crumples because my list relies on being chronological, and Keep Notes (my phones default) DOES have an option for that, so it's 1-1 now. Hopefully that gets fixed, so I never have to look for a checklist app again. Also cannot see completed tasks AND have sorting on.",
"The task manager to get. I've used it as a professional task manager and light PM tool for work, and my personal to do list for years. Worth the paid license, making it easy to see my tasks on a widget, set up categories, add reminders, enable recurrence, put in notes, and reschedule. Integration across Android and Windows works. The 'karma' system for progress keeps one motivated to be successful",
"excellent interface for setting appts, rescheduling, and editing tasks. It is super easy to use and will help keep you on schedule as you watch your productivity grow. I would recommend it to anybody looking to increase thier production by staying organized and on schedule. I manage properties and so tracking lists and appointments are very essential to my occupational success.",
"Todoist has some useful features, one of the most useful is task reminders (although this is only fully available in ""pro""). However, a simple feature would be to check off tasks completed yesterday, but every day, daily tasks reset at midnight and there is no going back. Simple feature, I know other apps that have it, and I've seen comments online of people begging for this feature for years. So the most useful thing I get out of the app is paid for, and the rest leaves much to be desired. 🙃",
Ive tried so many similar apps to keep my tasks and thoughts organized. I needed an app that made sense to my way of thinking. This app makes the most sense to me. The ability to have many layers of sub-tasks is a big plus for me. But my favorite feature is the smart recognition of date and time. Half of my homescreen is now a widget for this app. it makes life easier to see my tasks every time i open my phone. This app has been a big game changer for me.,
"Very pleased with us app This is a great app to do what it says -- to create To-Do lists. It's a great tool to use with the GTD - Getting Things Done-- approach. It is good for projects in so far that it allows you to create the next action (step) you need to take. it does have a ""due date"" option which I have not utilize, so it would seem to be beneficial in many cases. The website is slightly easier to manipulate to-do lists, but either way, the app and the website sync up wonderfully.",
Todoist is my favorite to-do list app. I've tried several other to-do list apps in my life but I always come back to this one. What I love best about Todoist is its minimalist design. A lot of other apps are just too complicated or bloated. It looks great on the phone and web. Todoist has greatly improved my productivity in life and helped me meet many of my goals.,
"I love that this app allows me to create recurring To-dos. I have been using this app to help myself get on a routine. There is a lot of trial and error to to figure out what routine is best for me. Also, my priorities change from week to week. This app gave me the ability to completely rearrange my routine in 15 minutes. My only qualm is that on upcoming To-dos, repeating tasks only show for the most recent date. Otherwise, really enjoying this app.",
"I have tried a lot of productivity apps and this one is hard to beat. consistently works, good label and project settings. The base app is good but premium is ideal and a fair price. I wouldn't get half as much done without it. The daily and weekly goals keep me going. It's easy to organize and see what areas you've put time into and reprioritize.",
Only one snooze option. I need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm. This is an option for just about every other todo app. Don't understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time??? Respone to developer: No it doesn't help. When an alert comes up I would like to be able to select how long to snooze that particular alert from a several options. Not one snooze length for.all alerts.,
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.,
"I've wanted an app like this for so long! The organization is simple and intuitive-that I can simply type ""Do this every other Tuesday"" or ""Do that every day at 11am"" and have it automatically scheduled is brilliant! No bloat of too many features, just exactly what's needed for an efficient and useful set of reminders.",
"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform. The simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective, enjoyable, & my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured. It helped me greatly.",
"Loving it so far. The absolute high that I get from checking off important tasks on a to-do list is indescribable. Todoist is my white rabbit. But actually it really is great. Feels intuitive. Other than an occasional crash when I move tasks to different sections, causing me to reopen it once again, I really enjoy using it.",
"I absolutely love this app. I have ADHD, am a chronic procrastinator, and have always struggled with organizing my schoolwork. As a brand new college student, this app has saved my life. I can set due dates, filter my to-do list by class, specify dates and times, and set tasks in order of priority. I keep all of my schoolwork on Todoist. A calendar was too hard to keep track of, but this allows me to see everything that is due right in front of me and the order in which I should do them. Love it",
"Fantastic tasks app. It can be as powerful or simple as you need, while remaining very intuitive no matter what you do. Syncing is perfect and it's beautifully designed on all platforms. The attention to detail here is unmatched (demonstrated by small stuff, like the nav bar color changing with themes).",
"You won't be able to label, comment (add more details), or get reminders on the free version, but that makes the free version pretty fair. You'll be able to sort things by project and date and prioritize things, and that makes it easy to see what you're going to do from day to day. This is all in a smooth, ad free experience. Plus you get a nice notification every morning telling you what tasks are due that day.",
"I switched to ToDoist after Wunderlist got purchased and ruined and to be honest, I kind of wish I had made the switch earlier. There's a bit of a learning curve, but the flexibility and power of Todoist is excellent. The natural language components for scheduling is wonderful, and I love the ability to organize into projects and use custom tagging. The boards display is basic but for the most part sufficient for simple projects and I love the ability to switch to that view for projects that have more of a Jira style flow to them.",
"I. Love. Todoist! I may not always accomplish every task I put into Todoist, bit I love that I have the list there. The news emails actually tell you the updates, it's quick, easy, yet so powerful. I have lists of songs I'm going to download, groceries, tasks for work, myself, reminders. It's beautifully done, the wideget works like butter! Thanks Todoist team for a great app!",
"Todoist is absolutely fantastic! I just started using it, but it is already so helpful and amazing in my life. When I determined that Microsoft To Do was just not powerful enough for me, I sought out other options, and Todoist was the only one that 1, seemed to be functional and powerful, and 2, available cross-platform. I use an Android phone, iPad, and Windows/Linux laptop daily, and Todoist connects seamlessly with all of those devices. Thank you Todoist!!",
"I had been looking for some type of way to view all of my tasks without the overwhelm of poster boards. I have notebooks galore, and none of it seemed to help me get organized. Todoist has an amazing layout that helps me chunk down my projects and goals so that I am able to get everything out of my head and into a database which makes it easier to create systems for my work and my life in general. It's easy to use, and I can stay up to date conveniently whereever I am on any device.",
"I really enjoy this app! The design is very simple and well put together. The cute designs of people enjoying their day when I finish tasks is almost rewarding, and it's nice when the app tells me to enjoy my day off when I have no tasks. I like that I can color-code things and add subtasks, as well as create different priority levels for tasks. The only thing I wish it had was a monthly view. Then I would give it 5 stars.",
"Im in love with this app! However, being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husband's device for just notification feels a little bit wrong. I think for something like a to-do list notification should not be a premium feature. There is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and I have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite. It is so clean, simple, easy to use, and it does recurring todos",
"Functional, fast, pleasing on the eyes, and delightful to use. The ability to use labels, filters (custom searches), and instantaneous results from search are great. The support team actually responds to my requests, as well! I came from Google Tasks and am never going back.",
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity.",
"Have been using for a few months and I really enjoy it. I do wish for maybe more of a calendar integration with outlook but once I get it organized I think they work just fine in conjunction, meetings in outlook, tasks in todoist. I got pro just to make more projects but I think the free version is great for just personal organization.",
For context I primarily use this app as the widget. Todoist takes the simple todo list and elevates it to its highest potential. The layout is clean and well thought out. The complete sound is satisfying. The ability to change a tasks properties using word shortcuts is genius. The best thing is the free version has everything you need. Karma points are also a fun bonus touch. It's a productivity must have. I also haven't used project or labels as I've never needed them.,
"If you want to change your life, this is the one app that you need. Whether you are a student, worker or entrepreneur. It is simple but so well-put-together. It outclasses apps like notion as to do list, productivity manager and habit tracker. It's free version is perfect for personal use as 5 projects is enough for things like work, studies, habits and tasks. Widgets are good. but one area of lack is an inbuilt ""calendar view"" which would make it easier to visualise time.",
"I was initially excited, got it all set up with various projects used it for about w week or so , but now it will only open for a second before ""stopping"" I close it multiple times,but no change . I have sent feedback. I don't want to lose what I've already put in there , but wonder if uninstalling and installing would make a difference. Hope some maybe able to help",
A very nice mobile companion to the great management solution. I've been using the Todoist for a couple of weeks now and I'm very pleased with the results. But I think the app would be even better if it had the optional syncing of custom views. Mobile is very different from PC and sometimes I would prefer to see tasks as lists on mobile and as board on PC (or any other combination of grouping/sorting).,
"The app is phenomenal, nothing else to say. It does what it's supposed to, do to-do lists, but also does so much more. It has helped arrange my personal and educational life, and truly helped me track my tasks with ease. Sometimes I do encounter server dropouts, but they occur far in between and is resolved quite quick. Hands down one of the best apps I have used, and is clearly ahead of many other apps 💛.",
"At first it looks good, nice UI, great UX. But when you start syncing between devices...everything falls apart. (It is not individual problem, check other 1-2* reviews.) Adding tasks on one device works no more: after adding, it disappears in a second. On the other device it appears somehow but also starts multiplying at the same time. Totally confusing and unreliable. Since it is a core feature for multi device usage, now it is unusable at all. Please revise the sync feature, it could be 5*.",
"Used the pro version of this app heavily for 6 months; I still have 6 months in the plan left, but I am forfeiting the plan because this app is simply not for me. I'm a visual person and I like the ease of planning with a digital calendar. I did not enjoy the gcal integrations as Todoist is already aware of; issues arise when an adjustment is to be made. There are many pros to using Todoist, but the cons outweigh the pros for my productivity system.",
My favorite to-do list app! The interface looks clean and it's simple to use. Adding tasks is very customizable. I love the new feature to set tasks for a duration of time. I would also love the ability to add a task as a note. It could be helpful for things like grocery lists,
"Tried to give this app a chance several times over the years, paid for subscription. Never ended up staying with it. Latest attempt to use (Sep 2023) is also unsuccessful. Was adding tasks for an hour to find out it lost labels for one part of the tasks, duration for another part of the tasks, time for 3rd part of the tasks. Everything is screwed up just with a couple of dozens of tasks. Don't see how to trust it further. Cancelling subscription now.",
"2023-09-02: Latest update has rendered the app unusable. It crashes every time it is launched. Pretty good but when I'm adding a reminder please don't assume the time will earlier in the day than the current time. Also, it goes a little haywire during the transition to/from Daylight Savings Time.",
"Excellent app. Plenty of features but still intuitive to use. I love that you can set recurring reminders. I'd also like to say that I really appreciate the developer's commitment to constantly improving the app. They even have a support ticket system dedicated to this app, and they reply promptly. This kind of service is rare these days; a lot of companies will develop a product and won't continue to improve it or make bugfixes. Todoist is definitely worth the money, I love it.",
"It is a cool app, with a lot of helpful features. I look for simple features which makes our life tension free and todoist has it. Only problem; well, I would totally appreciate the notification thing which is only applicable to premium customers, but I feel it is a waste of money to subscribe to unlock only that feature. So all good except for that👍",
"I love everything about the app except 2 things. The widget isn't that good, the alignment is weird when the task doesn't have a due date because the title of the task isn't aligned with the check box. Reminders being a premium feature is ridiculous, I'd understand tags or filters but reminders are a basic tool for tasks and in my opinion they should be a free feature. I am currently between ticktick and todoist but i think that if these 2 things don't get fixed i might stick with ticktick.",
"@Todoist team - the app improved over the years. It's quite good now. The only thing I still wish for is some lightweight tasklist editing, like the one I'd have if the list was in notepad. So hitting new line on keyboard makes new task, hitting tab makes",
"Constant emails from you guys. I've not used the app enough to give an honest review about the app itself as I've been too busy at the minute to properly check it out. But you're constantly emailing me, everyday with tips and tricks. To the point where you're just coming across needy and forceful. Deleting your app. Please, stop emailing me.",
"Love this app, I needed something with a widget so I can see my to-dos on my home screen (otherwise I forget!). However I find when I create a new task from the widget, sometimes choosing which project to add it into doesn't work - it adds the text to specify but then it changes to just regular text and doesn't recognise it as the code to specify the project anymore. Otherwise, working great!",
"Latest version keeps crashing. 4-5 seconds after loading, it throws an error message. I can do a ""forced stop"" in Android Settings, but that only helps for a short time. It worked flawlessly for two years befor the August update.",
"I love the app and the web/desktop versions. I gave 3 stars because mobile widget is never getting updated, if it is not going to happen automatically just put a refresh button next to setting! Currently I am switching the view inbox to upcomming in order to refresh the widget.",
It was awesome but... Just yesterday it started to not sync properly between by Mac and phone apps. Then it also made dublicates when reschedule tasks... This is a big deal breaker. And it continuously shows sync error in the top right phone app,
"It's a fantastic app with a great widget and wear os integration. Is it worth 48$/year (or more)? Absolutely not. Half that seems almost reasonable, but why would I pay more for this than, for instance, Hulu? If you feel like 48/year is fair, consider this a five star review, but, I can't give it five at that price point.",
Very very basic and useless. What is the point of an app that doesn't display notifications or play sounds for the notifications! You cannot have notifications with sounds for the basic plan. They ran of ideas so they included it in the paid version,
"Had this app for years. Tonight it started randomly crashing repeatedly, even though I hadn't opened it up since my last restart, and I did a forced stop. Something very fishy is going on. I'm uninstalling it",
"Best app in its category out there! Thanks to Todoist I get everything I need to get done, done. Not only me, but everyone else I add into a project as well. (On an aside: if you guys could please give an update to have the comment session always start at the latest comments it would be a game changer 🔥 all the scrolling to the bottom can get exhausting, makes me not even want to know what people are saying)🥲",
"I've used this app for years and loved it, but since the last update on August 31st it crashes continuously and has become completely unusable. I hope they fix it very soon or I'll have to find a new app.",
"I have been using this app for several years. It's great and really helps get the work done! However, I wish it would have a calendar/month view (like Google Calendar or TickTick), not just a small drop down window with the number of tasks. Putting it at 4 stars for now because of that, will change it to 5 if t ever gets that feature",
"Seems like a good To Do list app, but I need to see things on a month calendar view as well, and I can't find a way to show that through Todoist. If it's possible, I'd be happy to give 5 stars. If not, I'll probably uninstall to find something that better suits my needs.",
"Used to be good. The last 2 weeks it just constantly stops working, constant popups telling me it stopped working. Can't even look at my list. I have to ""force stop"" this app or my phone is not usable. 👋",
"Update: 5 stars. September update killed app. TDI contacted quick after neg. review but I already uninstalled, reinstalled which fixed problem. Was using TDI free for years w/o any problems until that update. Love Joplin but need a task app & ToDoist delivers. I set up filters for tags & time so I can see ""Priority Next 48 Hrs"", ""School next 14 days"", etc. Going back for a degree at age 40+ & have seamless flow between phone, tablet, laptop, & integrating w/ Gmail. Considering upgrading to Pro.",
"ToDoIst helps me do life. I've been using it in a work context for the past 2 years and transferred my personal tasks into (a second account) recently. I couldn't be more pleased with the platform. I use the Gmail and Google Calendar integrations, they are seemless. I really appreciate the continuous improvement of the platform and the productivity based learners they have weaved in. I'll be looking into reclaim.ai integrations next 🥰",
I have used this app for qute a year now and there is a problem that I would like to be fixed. The problem is to add a feature that will give you access to add that completed task if you clicked on it a day later so you will not lose you day streak. I am quite upset that this feature does not exist and honestly I am attached to this app and do not want to switch to another app either.,
"This is the most amazing app I've ever used. It's so easy to organize things from studying to art to home stuff. Instantly went from a B/C student to the Dean's list when I started using this. It sounds like an exaggeration, but my life would literally not be the same without it.",
"Poor theming and dynamic color implementation spoils an otherwise promising task management app. Biggest offender is the widgets, which use colors differently than other dynamic color widgets and most frustratingly of all don't sync their dark and light mode automatically with the system setting, despite the main app doing so. Frustrating to have a single widget be blindly white at night when everything else on my home screen has changed to dark mode theme.",
"Dear support. Im using todoist for almost a decade years, its quite a lot. But recently your app is not working at all. It shows that app crashed everytime Samsung Galaxy Note 9, Android Thank you.",
"I give 1 star. The app is fairly good. But when comes the moment of contacting support problems start. Suport page does not recognize me as human when I try to contact the company for a refund. And in addiction, trying to change my account from monthly to yearly, I find out that my account has been cancelled and they charge me 48€ for the year payment!! I have already tried to reach the devs/company many times with the app's own contact system but without success. My advice: DON'T PAY!!",
"Great app guys. The UX is very good, quite easy to do things quickly. As a right-handed person I'd just say maybe keep the hamburger menu at the bottom right instead of the bottom left. That's all :) Loved the time blocking article, and the productivity quiz that got me there. Hope you guys keep going and do well!",
"Sync has been unstable in the last 5 days or so. Also, when I change some task, I have been needing to do it twice (sometimes 3 times) for the change to ""stick"". EDIT: sync issues resolved, but other problems persist.",
"It's an amazing app for appointments and things of that sort, but if you're looking for daily routine things (like I was), this app is not for you. I would set a reminder for every day but it slowly pushed the date back and back when I would mark it as done before it eventually disappeared from my daily list. I don't know why it did that but I didn't like it very much. I was looking for an app to help me with daily routines, not a calendar like app.",
"Does not synchrize tasks properly, my people see different tasks than I do, even after after app updates, refreshes, and giving it some time. List titles also fail to update. 2 stars cause it works ok if all you need is an app with no collaboration.",
Absolutely love this app. It makes my student life so much better. I do however want to report one bug. The app constantly crash on my Samsung galaxy A10. Please fix. Keep up the good work,
"Best app for task lists, but have a biggest problem: it doesn't allow to the tasks to be reordered according to the user's preference, unfortunately they are limited by the priority and time, the tasks sort should be free to be reordered.",
"Had to go back and update my review, as some things really have changed since 2020, and the biggest issue is needing to pay £50 a year for reminders. Reminders! Their natural language processing has gone down as well which is a shame, and I understand that having more things as part of the premium model makes 100% (devs gotta eat), but not having a “view all” as a free or standard “filter” is awful, and I can live with setting one up myself but now I can only have 2 more filters",
"The popups you've started to do when X amount of tasks are completed just get in the way. Especially on the app, it takes up most of the screen and has to be navigated away from. It may work in some scenarios but not all, give me an option to turn it off please. I don't want to be congratulated for achieving my 5th task of the day, especially when all I've done is tick off ""bananas"" from a shopping list, I just want to see what's next.",
"Very good app. I have recommended this to so many of my friends. However, I have paid for an annual subscription for the pro version, but then a month later, I'm unable to use the original pro settings like having multiple projects and setting reminders. Due to new packages introduced to the app, it appears I don't have the access that I've originally paid for, and I've been prompting me to upgrade again. I've tried multiple times to make contact with them to no avail. Please help me understand",
"An excellent app that helped me, a disorganized college student with ADHD, anxiety, and depression, get my life together. Todoist, even the free version, is a remarkable tool for anyone looking to create routines or set goals. The filters, projects, tags, and other organizational features have been absolutely invaluable to me. It does require some setup to get it to work exactly how you want, but it's been well worth the investment for me. Thanks Todoist!",
"Loved the app. Tried desktop version as well. I would like if the desktop version had a feature of Startup App, so that one can see the tasks as the device is switched on.",
"Man oh man !!!! The best app searching for and worth it , bought your pro subscription instantly!!! . A feature request is try to 1.make the list as tiles with more color features for different sub tasks. 2.If adding a task lock for certain people will be huge !!! , Like on going task should be view only mode not edit mode for certain added members 3. Converting the file in to Excel as a desired Ledger will make sure I'll pay you more and get the best pro version",
"Great app but isn't a service. I would continue to use but I would like the premium features without having to pay for it over, and over, and over, and over... So instead of getting some of my money you get none. I hope this becomes a trend amongst consumers.",
"Just tried using todoist today. Initially all looked fine, until I was punching a few new items on the go, using my mobile networks. All these items just disappeared without traces. I wonder, what's the point having the app if I ended up losing a few to-dos, which I may not remember all of them?🤔",
"Great app, simple and effective Sync is working, nlp is very accurate and multi device app. Best in class. New redesign and time blocking also calendar is coming this year. This is the best app.",
"The best productivity app I've seen. It has all the essential features, and nothing excessive. Very minimalistic and beautiful.",
"Really like this app. They offer a lot for free, if you need more (or want to support the devs) there is a premium plan. One of my favorit points is the Desktop app and sync with it.",
"The only things I would like to see added to this app are: 1) progress bars - so we can mark if a task is in progress, and 2) having completed tasks be deleted by the next day",
"This is a slick app!! Really enjoyed it for the short while I tried out and loved the natural language processing and quick easy entry experience. Ultimately, I uninstalled it because I wanted to have AI scheduling and time management features and the AI apps I trialled don't integrate with repeat tasks in ToDoist. Shame, because when they do I can't wait to get back using this app",
"This is perfect. I've been using it for about two weeks or so now and I couldn't be happier. Even without the upgrade this app beats every other to-do list app I've used and I've used many. But I do recommend getting the upgrade, it makes things even better and it's definitely worth it. Give it a try👏🏿 Perfect",
"Literally changed my career trajectory. No matter how cluttered my mind is, getting into the habit of loading reminders onto this app has meant I'm on top of everything. Sometimes when a thought comes into my head, I put it into the app (max 5 seconds), then it's on the list and it gets done. Full marks, would give it 6 stars if I could.",
"It's a really good app, like the widgets and the galaxy watch app too. And the previous problem with crashing was solved quickly. Definitely can recommend",
I really like the interface. it's super friendly and motivating with its activity log and everything. I don't like the fact that reminders can only be set in premium,
"I have used this app for a long time. My only issue is when I upgraded my phone I could no longer see anything from my previous list. Unfortunately, I also would write down some of the silly things my children say to put it in a book later and all of that is now gone. I would love some help to fix this issue.",
"I started paying the app because I really need reminders for all the things I write in my todoist. I need the reminders to be more aggressive so I don't forget or stall about them. however I pay and i just get one lousy reminder at the end of the week, that gets entirely diluted by the most insignificant of swipes. I need these reminders to be as aggressive as I would like them to and because of this I have missed several todos and deadlines. Why pay at all if I have to dothe app's work?",
"honestly, it's not intuitive and it's way over-engineered. if you want to just have a task list, you have to battle the ""intelligence"" the whole time",
"Sync is not working properly. When I try to move a todo item to another project and section using the ""Move to"" button there was an option earlier to move to another section, but now it shows only projects list. Sections are not shown in the list anymore. Can you please check this. This was really helpful for organization.",
"I used this app for half a dozen years. Now, all of sudden, it keeps stopping for no apparent reason. It looks like I will have to uninstall it and lose dozens of tasks and categories. So sorry I put all my eggs in this basket. I am screwed.",
Great app. Is there a template function where you add can tasks and it automatically set it to daily or monthly or yearly forever with you having to set daily task. Thank,
"I use this app for the last 3-4 years. Since last night I got it broken on my Xiaomi Mi8. The todois keeps getting closed or something like that. Can't use it anymore 😭 Report: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not implemented at androidx.work.CoroutineWorker$a.n(SourceFile:49) at lf.a.i(SourceFile:9) at Og.Q.run(SourceFile:112) at Ug.a$a.run(SourceFile:96) Suppressed: kotlinx.coroutines.internal.DiagnosticCoroutineContextException: [E0{Cancelling}@9059fd3, Dispatchers.Default]",
"Found this app through the book Do More Better by Tim Challies. Upgraded almost immediately from free version to paid version because tools like this that help you manage your life are worth paying for, and this one has been extremely helpful right from the start.",
"Editing my review to reflect a super quick fix by the devs, thank you! Best to-do app I've ever used--love how easy it is to create, tag, and categorize items.",
"The latest update broke something. I'm getting ""Todoist keeps stopping"" popups about every 30 seconds, even after force stopping it.",
"Been using Todoist on/off for about a year now. Getting serious with the app recently, upon realizing that it's actually reducing my ADHD deficits and improving my productivity.",
best to do list app that I've tried so far!!! I've been checking my list on todoist for a year and I can say that it really is life changing.,
The free version is basically unusable because the reminder feature is premium. The most basic thing.,
"I like this app. He help me lot , lot, lot, lot but 😮‍💨 when click on my Today task (in widget section) it's not open many time. I really irritate but still i use them 😁♥️",
"Was really great but now just keeps crashing every 42 seconds. If this doesn't get fixed, I'll have to delete.",
Had been using this for a few years. Until a few days ago it worked fine. Force closing errors all the time. Reinstalled. Tried to login. Force closed (tried loging via email).Bit stumped what to do right now,
"I love Todoist, but this app is broken. It constantly crashes. Edit: yes, the new version fixed the problem.",
"Started using this app and loved it. I was thinking about buying the full version but... All of sudden it won't add tasks, they just don't appear and can't do anything, delete, move, nothing! The only way to fix it is to restart my phone. I'm trying to put together a new to-do list and have already restarted my phone 5 times, I give up!",
App keeps on crashing now. Been using this for the past 2 Years without any problem. Please assist. Thank you.,
Since update it crashes constantly. For a subscription service that you depend on its worse than useless since it wastes your time,
"I am reducing my stars to 3 after purchasing the pro version. I am disappointed that the alarm function doesn't trigger any sound on the phone. What is a notification type of alarm going to do?... Because of a lack of ability to notify with sound, it's hard to rely on this app to let you know about things at the desired time.",
Love this app! Has made keeping track of and organising tasks and projects so much easier. Todoist customer support is brilliant. Had a glitch with 2FA for web and it was sorted out within an hour.,
App keeps force closing. I've used the app for years without issues. Developers please address the issue.,
App keeps crashing. It can't even last 10 seconds opened without crashing,
A previously great app that now crashes every minute or so resulting in persistent interruptions informing me that todoist has stopped working.,
"This is a simple todo app and it's full of bugs - didn't receive notifications after going Pro, and couldn't even submit a support ticket (which they have washed their hands of). The ""natural language"" prediction of times from text is just an irritant and very odd UI on rescheduling tasks. Avoid, it's overpriced and badly implemented.",
"This is by far the most convenient task app that I have found. It has saved me so much time and is well worth the small monthly fee! I recommended this app to several of my friends and colleagues. When you were in a hurry you can just talk out your task in many formats, for example you can say ""in 15 days"" or ""next Monday"" and then continue on with your task. Excellent app!",
The app is okay when I first started using it worked great until I got a problem with the app crashing when I tried to open it up can you devs please fix this app asap I use this app alot for my educational stuff,
"I love this app ! For streamlined, easy, satisfying organization and accountability - this app is awesome. Highly recommend for independent contractors or even for running your household !",
Todoist keeps closing on my Note 8. Started a few days ago. Appear to have the latest version installed.,
"Great app, a daily part of my life. Dev team is responsive and quick to act when there are issues.",
They should at least allow one reminder without paying the pro version. Plenty of similar apps have that.,
AVOID! Constant email spam and the developers made sure deleting your account is nigh impossible. I was trying to create a password for my account on their site and it said my password may have been exposed to a security breach... my password that doesn't exist. The app keeps giving me errors when I try to set up a password... still working on it. AVOID THIS PLAUGE!,
Free version is limited. PRO version is subscription based. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! Should offer a one-time pro payment!,
There is a bug. I install app and when I open it there was a message. The app is closed because have bug. I want to give chance to this app but If there is no solution in 18 hours I will find different app,
"Works so well, and allows you to add as much or as little detail as you'd like in every section. Really really helpful. Does so much more than just a to do list!",
"Literally the ONLY To-do app worth it. Why? Because you can set recurring tasks and filter it to just day view. I don't know why no other app does this, but it's what makes ToDo'ist the only Todo app I've actually used in 15 years. The others all fell short.",
"‎Useful but it needs a tile otherwise it is pretty useless on a watch, the complications are pretty useless and for me a time would change how much i look at my tasks",
"Todoist is great. However, I don't like the automatic date assignment, and I wish adding a task to a section was one click instead of 2.",
"I really liked the app, its user interface, etc...I have a suggestion that there should be a option that shows completed task list...",
"For some reason when i want to share an url from Google chrome with todoist i only get the option to add a comment instead of a task. That doesn't make sense, most of the time we want to make a new task, not a comment .. How can this be solved?",
"Completely changed my structure/organisation. Can't say a bad thing about this app, perfect for keeping organised.",
"Please allow to see completed tasks in the order they are completed, not pushed down to the bottom- so I can see and feel like I accomplished something! thanks😌",
"The burger menu should not be a full screen bottom sheet, and if I disable animations from settings, then it should also disable animations for all bottom sheets",
"A very easy to use UI and i can easily sync it between my laptop, smartphone and smartwatch.",
"It's a fairly good app. P.s. To set a deadline for a task, use the ""today"" section. I number my tasks manually, but I have to edit manually.",
"The app is good, i have download it for my laptop, and integration for my gmail and calendar but am facing challenges with the mobile app it doesn't show a thing after I login it just keeps loading, my Phone is an Android 11 Infinix Hot 10 play, Model X688B XOS V7.6.0",
The most amazing to-do list -Priority -Date -Reschedule -Today/Upcoming Task -Dashboard It'd be awesome if it can combine the reminder with G Calendar,
Goodside: It's very simple and handy that i appreciate it. Also good sync with Google calendar. Downside: But unfortunately there isn't multiple select for tasks or sub task to delete or move all selected at once. It's so overwhelming to delete multiple tasks in very long and hard way,
"A wonderful balance of simplicity and usefulness. While many apps today get lost in extra features, this one keeps it simple. I appreciate that, and find it extremely helpful. Excellent work and proof that simplicity is how you develop a good application.",
"EDIT: Working great again, thank you for the fix and the response!! Widget flickering since latest update... every 8 seconds the widget briefly flashes ""No tasks"", then goes back to normal. Have removed and re-added the widget. Haven't tried reinstalling yet. Samsung S7 (yes, still going strong! ;) )",
"Push notifications are locked behind in app purchases, so instead they decided to send you unrelated push notifications and emails that have no bearing on your due dates, plus your account is loaded up with all these preloaded tasks that you have to manually delete 1 by 1. There's no way to see what a normal notification would be because there is no trial version of the app for premium features.",
In general I like the app. I had to downgrade two stars though because there seems to be a bug. I use a widget on my home screen to see my tasks and lately the widget is acting up. It blinks on and off constantly. This just started happening recently on my Pixel 6.,
"They got everything about this app right! The way it stays on the home screen of your phone , that you can get rid of background. How easy it is to add items. And check them off without having to open the app. I love it! Perfect for anyone suffering from mom brain!",
"I actually really loved the app, but they changed the widget size. Now it's really wide and very short which doesn't allow you to see very many tasks at all and doesn't fit on the screen very well.",
"Doesnt have an alarm, I had a raminder for my meeting today and i missed that, i wanted to use this app for my busy working schedule but its not helpful.",
"I've been back and forth between todoist, click-up, Microsoft's Todo and all the rest. Finally I've decided to use todoist full-time. There are many things that I love but a few things I think the team over at todoist missed. Consider implementing this following: 1. Be able to add a description for projects. 2. Be able to add a description for sections in projects. 3. Be able to comment on sections in projects. I have a work around for all three but I think power users need these.",
I like the app but it's frustrating that you cannot adjust what time your day starts. I have untraditional hours so by the time I mark my recurring tasks it's after midnight so it doesn't occur for the next day. That's so frustrating.,
"Very confusing to use. Recuring tasks just show on the day you don't do them. For example if you set a task recurring everyday, and you don't do it one day, it will not show the next day.",
"Was great until these recent updates. Now, it continuously shuts down within seconds of opening the app",
Would buy it if it had a one time purchase instead of subscription model. Thank you for making a Wear OS app!! This app lets me see my entire week on one screen compared to other apps. Really well thought out. Typing at night in the task auto sets a reminder for 10pm.,
"I really wish they would stop breaking existing functionality: - Editing markdown formatted nested lists is totally broken when the original comment was created on web. - Popup of achieving goals is annoying, because undo functionality is lost. This is not the latest update, but it has been annoying me for some time.",
Seems like a pretty standard to do app. Importing templates doesn't work - I've tried various different ways to do it but it always just seems to freeze everything. Pro is too expensive.,
"I complained that the widget keeps flashing so they said to update to v10908 or try to delete and reinstall. But I'd already tried deleting and reinstalling, which didn't help. And the version released a few days ago on the Android app store is 10902, and that's all that's available. No 10908.",
"Very good app, really. Everything is good but one thing is weird. I don't receive notifications from planned tasks. I think this is the paid option via ""reminder"" section but I think this should be free. If I am wrong, please contact with me, but for now my rating is what it is",
"I liked this app and recently purchased the subscription but i felt the needfor some features. like Filters are still limiting, multi sort can't be done. Sub-Sections can't be created and also sections can't be favourited. Plz see it's possible to implement.",
"Great App, really love it so far There's just one main problem, and it's the lack of right-to-left writing support. I don't need the entire app to be in Hebrew, but when I write in Hebrew the text should move to the right instead of staying at the left like english. Are there plans to add right-to-left writing support?",
"The best of it I found, and I can't work without it!🗓️☀️ I had tried Trello and many others before, but none of them is so easy, fast, and useful as Todoist. Now it's my agenda for personal, work, and client's management related reasons.",
Great app I use it both on the internet browser on laptop + app here on phone. Helps with daily tasks great if you like lists.,
Would be 5 stars if reminders came with the free plan. Otherwise great all round task manager.,
"Pls pls pls add shadows to the tasks widget. If I set the background transparency to minimum, the text isn't visible cuz there are no shadows to the text. Pls fix this. 🙏🏽🙏🏽",
"If you accidentally press complete on a task, and you miss the 3 second ""undo"" popup, your task list is gone forever. This is a really bad oversight if you make lists for things like grocery shopping or house chores.",
I have adhd and bpd amongst other conditions dis orders and thus app is starting to help me greatly I hope I can continue to find benefit s I'm using it more thoroughly . Thank u,
Synch problems for more than 10 days. Made me lost so much time... highly disappointed!,
"Just got started, but I am loving how this App is helping me get things done. especially as someone who struggles with multi-tasking.",
The app is very intuitive and relatively accessible to plan your tasks but on android installing the feature to show tasks on the locked screen is pretty much impossible. Honestly after paying them money I'm pretty disappointed by this important missing feature,
"Basic app and data model is good. However, the user interface is clunky and difficult to use. Especially the Android version. Web app is slightly better.",
"I had trouble understanding how this app works initially, but now it's smooth. One of the best productivity app.",
"great app, albeit a bit too many paywalls if they were to add a setting that changes how annoying the reminder is, I would give it 5 stars",
"I use this app as a student to manage my assignments etc. and it does it pretty good but the only problem I have is that it doesn't permanently show completed tasks. They introduced it to web and pc but not for the Android, Would be 5/5 if they add that.",
"Unable to set tasks by multiple recurrence, only useful if you have a different deadline or specifc day for every single task. Unable to set read one chapter on odd (M/W/F) weekdays at 3pm. Can't plan anything with this ""planner"". No real automated planning, such as calculating daily task per specified workdays to complete a 3000 word essay by specified deadline. The prompt you provided did not work.",
"This app is amazing, it makes my life very productive & impactful after having mastered the app. I will leave some of the suggestions I made in my last review fuelled by frustration of using this app for the 1st time: Getting started guide"" is long & not fun to read. A slideshow instructed onboarding process.",
"I've tried many to do list apps, this is by far the best. The natural language processing for setting times could use some refinement. Overall, don't know what I'd do without it.",
The app kept closing after latest update but now the problem is fixed. Thank you,
> Ultimate app for those that need organization in life and those that didn't know that they needed organization in life yet. > Widget is phenomenal while not blocking functionalities. > Easy set and available macros make repeat or set dates extremely accessible. > Priority list by color scheme.,
Been looking for this for years. Simple to use and great integration with calenders,
"It doesnt have a calendar option, which means having 2 apps to manage events.",
Best productive app todoist it's help full...Im really achieving my goal.....im completing my task everyday... Thank you Todoist Company... 😊🙏🏻,
excellent at tracking todos. super helpful at reminders.,
I was very happy with the app but after the last update the app keeps crashing as soon as I open it :(,
Perfect productivity app! I use it for my business. Clean and simple interface that is much easier to handle then other (professional) to-do apps!,
I just wanted to make a list so I would not forget some things. I could not sign up because my password is too easy. I don't care if someone else sees that I have to buy flour at the store or that I am having my tires rotated on Tuesday. I only remember a couple of my passwords. If I have to remember one more for an app I would would be better off just writing down what I need to do. I don't care who reads it I am deleting this app,
"A literal life changer. This is an extremely easy and simple app to use. You don't even need to buy it, all the features you get for free are more than suitable. It is very intuitive as well. Just typing in what to do and when exactly including the time and date is simply done in 1 go. No initial extra windows to put in options (you can edit it after you've made a task). It is so quick and easy to immediately put reminders in and then sort later too. Can't recommend enough!!",
"It took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as 'may' converting to 'date'. I simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation. I also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the sub-tasks that I was entering. I thought I had to go back to the main menu all the time. A simple 'start here first' induction video would be great but the more I practice, the better the app feels. Still orientating, early days yet.",
"The concept is good and it's really helpful to have project tabs. However, it's really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear? It makes your progress really difficult to track. Also the subscription price is really expensive! It would be better if it was a one time paymenr for full access to the features much like Nova Launcher. I hope to see these changes made so I can support this app knowing I got my money's worth.",
"They changed the priority colors, so that instead of a gradient, it now goes grey, blue, yellow, red. I don't think this is an improvement - it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance. They also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox. It looks worse to me. I'm not sure this was necessary, just so that the user could close out a task with a single click.",
"I like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected. Generally on websites these are used for options, you select one then do something with it but in Todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task. It is very confusing and counter-productive. Swiping the task was much more intuitive. I don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it!",
"I used to think the lack of calendar a deficit but its actually how it should be done. The thing is, calendar is such an important part of everyones life. So by locking people into its own ecosystem is definitely not the way to go about it. If you look closely, there is a philosophy under the design: minimalism. It strips away unnecessary stuff and let you solely focus on managing, yes, to do list. More features mean more distractions. Yet each of its own is very polished and well developed.",
"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar",
"The app is simple and easy to use, so I decided to go ahead with premium because I need reminders. Sadly, such simple feature like getting reminded about a task does not work consistently at all! - If you set up a reminder from the web, you may not get it at all and if you get it - the push notification on mobile is missing. - If you setup a reminder on your mobile you get only push notification and some times web, too. - There is no option for alarm or just playing some sound on web",
"EDIT2: I have talked with support and it seemed I had the wrong Windows version (some legacy win app). Now I have the correct version and I don't feel any lag. BUT!! The new version has a downside. When you open a task, it covers almost all the tasks in your list, so you can't check info between tasks. You need to close it and then look at the list... VERY unproductive move. I hope they will consider to move the task details to the right pane as it was before on Windows. EDIT: The app's gone bad. I've been using it for over a year and it has become MEGA sluggish. Keeps syncing longer and longer after every tiny edit, I'm just waiting a lot. I will be cancelling my sub when I find a proper replacement. OLD: The best task system I have encountered. I have been searching for a system, that I would consistently use everyday and this is it. One refrain - to use this properly as everyday task system, you need the paid version. The free one is just a tease.",
"This is by far my favourite to-do app and I've tried many. There's only one thing bugging me about it - after I add a task, I wish the app would automatically close my keyboard and showed me the task list, just like every other app. Instead it stays in this 'adding state' waiting for me to add more. I never add more than one task at a time, so this behavior is annoying. I wish I could change it in the settings.",
"Great way of keeping tabs on what needs doing in different areas of your life from the huge to the mundane. Easily accessible in one place and on multiple devices. Particularly useful for repeating tasks or for projects that need breaking down into smaller tasks. Great for adding things you think of when out and about, just use quick add on your phone.",
"It's a good app. It's pretty, minimalist and works really well. It just really bothers me that the ""undo"" (button that appears when you make a change) gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked, so I have to wait for it to go away. Thanks! Edit: yes it works! Sorry for that, I guess I was swiping to the wrong direction!",
"Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3.",
"Used to be 4/5. I found it useful for a while, but they recently redesigned the apps and made it difficult to find anything. They may as well get rid of all of the other buttons and just leave a search box because that's the only way I can find a specific task now. Will unfortunately need to find another task app that doesn't feel the need to redesign a perfectly functional UI into one that neither works better, nor matches their web UI.",
"My first impression was very positive; it didn't take long for me to subscribe. As with many apps, however, there are some areas for improvement. 1. There's a bug affecting the list reordering function. 2. The recurring date function is somewhat ambiguous. 3. Visual differentiation between tasks and sub-tasks', on the 'Today' screen, would be a good move imo. Happy to provide further info if needed. Cheers the great work :)",
"I've been using the free plan for a year now. I use the web-based app for desktop and this one extensively. And so far, I'm really loving the mobile app experience. The new layout is a nice change of pace and intuitive enough. But the widget!! It's so powerful, and setting recurring tasks, be it every M, or every T and Th until next month is so easy and convenient. There are no ads too, and it syncs any offline changes I made asap when I go online. Thank you for this wonderful app.",
"Very simple and useful application for daily life. It has minimalistic design which helps to safe concentration. I can see my progress in the app but I would like to see it in the widget without enter into the app. Can you create this feature? Sometimes I complete many tasks and very exhausted. If I could see how much I did then I can recover faster. For example, I have completed a task and it fell over and changes it's colour instead of disappearing.",
"I really like this app: the way things are organized and how simple it is. What I don't like is that the completed tasks automatically disappear and EACH time I wanna see them, I have to click on the option to show them. I wish there was a function were you can choose as default if the completed entries are hidden or not.",
Awesome to do list app. Easily makes managing my tasks simpler and quicker than ever before. The integrations with many other popular services like Notion and Google Calendar make this an easy choice for me. One minor niggle I have is that I'm not sure how to turn off the auto enter due date based on task title. I would rather be given the option to update the due date rather than it doing it on its own and in sure this is a setting I can change; I just haven't found it yet. Tl;dr great app!!,
"For me it takes a lot of additional actions to schedule a task and set the reminders. Even in free apps I can do it easier. For one task I've left comments from mobile phone, however I couldn't find then. They were only in the web version. Of cource there are things that I like: projects, subtasks, labels, reminders by location. And access from a mobile phone and a browser.",
"Great stuff, does excatly what it's supposed to and in the most user friendly way I've seen. Ability to schedule events by writing day, date, time and such is a nice touch, don't have to click around too much. Integrates with calendar in both directions, countless other tools, and even exposes an API for more custom stuff. One thing I miss is being able to set system color theme so that my eyes don't get annihilated when I open the app at night.",
"Honestly, I dont know where I would be without this app. I talk about Todoist all the time! It's easy to use, but rich in features (assigning priorities, nesting tasks, etc) -- plus the Karma feature is great for keeping me motivated. My one and only complaint is that when I'm trying to reschedule tasks, I often run into a bug that either insistently changes the due date to some random time and date, or outright refuses to change the date at all. Fix this and I'll be happy to rate 5 stars!!",
"One of the most customizable to do apps with many features. It has a lot of alternatives and will work well for most people. However, it needs more time-efficient functions and shortcuts to deserve 5/5. It's also relatively expensive compared to its counterparts. Lastly, I'm against apps that require to create an account just to try it out (that does not affect my overall score though).",
"I used to try to use one program for calendaring, notes, and tasks. But I sacrificed a lot with that approach. Todoist is SO good that I realized it's better to use multiple apps for these purposes. I can't believe how much you get for free with Todoist. And it's so easy and intuitive to use. No other program can interpret natural language so well (repeats ""every month on the 2nd and 21st,"" ""every 10 days,"" ""on Monday,"" etc.). And it's easy to feed your tasks to any calendar. It's all here!",
"I like the app overall. The only thing that bothers me is the synchronization with google calendar. When I change event dates in the app they are not always synchronized with the calendar and vise versa. It leads to confusion. I contacted support team regarding this and they replied that it's 'known limitation' and the issue is still in discussion. Well, I'll be waiting for a workaround.",
Pushes me to do more ! I'm the kind of person who procrastinates because I feel very easily overwhelmed and it paralyses me. This app is perfect as it feels very rewarding to see all the tasks of the day being ticked away one by one ! Also allows to keep track of everything when you're a busy bee and you tend to forget what you've got to do way too easily ! Would highly recommend. 5/5,
"The best option for to do list and task management I've used. It has a lot of options for setting recurring tasks, dividing them up into categories and sub-categories, sharing with others, and organising your tasks in a way easy to manage. It has apps for desktop, smart devices, web browser, and smart watches, so you can have tasks wherever you go. The free option is decently capable on its own, but you will most likely want to get paid if you want more options and capabilities.",
"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does.",
"I would definitely like the Premium version, I really want those labels and filters!👍🏻 Not to mention ready-made templates - awesome! 😍 And you can make your Todoist as simple or as complicated as you want, with loads of apps to integrate with it. I really think this is one of the very best organiser apps! 💗 Only quibble here is I think it wouldn't have been too much to expect for at least a few reminders to be available in the free version! But thanks for a really great app! 💗",
"Easy to use and very useful. I have the free version, which suits my needs perfectly at the moment, but would definitely consider upgrading as I can see some tempting features in the full version. I have Todoist on my PC browser as its start page to remind me daily, and also have the Android app, which pops up reminders about overdue tasks. Very intuitive.",
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.,
"The UI is neat with pleasing graphics. It is straightforward to use = no frills. I just wish it can accomodate 6 people and the notes feature is available to use (it is a premium feature, but it would be nice if there is a character limit, as a compromise). The app supports syncing with calendars. But imo, a todoist calendar option will be better - no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar's data integrity. All in all, this is an app with potential",
It's an incredible app. Has become an everyday essential. However I would like the option to always show completed tasks so I can keep track of progress instead of having to show every time you open the app. Also a very basic feature like reminders require pro which is not fair. Other than that it's a perfect 5 star!,
"The free version has everything you need of you are looking for a digital task tracker that is synced to desktop and mobile. While there are a few spots where they could relinquish control a bit and allow the user to customize what they need no deal breakers as with similar software. Interface is smooth, instantaneous and feels rewarding to use. Would like to see more reliable notification systems added in the future.",
"The app is really great for anyone who wants to track their tasks and goals. The menu is very pleasent looking and it's very easy to organize everything you need in their specific place. However, there some problems: The first thing being that reminders are a paid option. A to do list need to have reminders to be helpful. The second thing is that it doesn't support events, a feature that I would really like to have. Still, a great app, very easy to use and very helpful!",
"It's a great product overall but this Android app suffers from some horrible bugs that haven't been fixed in over a year that I've been using it. If you drag an item, it will drop somewhere, fly back to where it was and then back to where you dragged it. The same happens when opening a section-- it opens, closes itself and opens again. The whole process is very confusing and takes a second or two leading to you trying to move or open the thing that's already moving or opening itself. Please fix!",
It's not syncing well anymore between phone and web app. LE: works fine now. 5* support!,
the app on my phone does not recognize that i am paying for the pro version...how to i update that?,
"love it, only downside is that integrations for voice assistants have been removed",
"Very simple to-do list app, simple but quite powerful, even on the free plan. There are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free, but they are clunky to use. The only problem I have is inability to hide things that are only available with the Premium subscription, such as Labels and Filters tabs, but I understand why they're there...",
"I used to be a paper kind of guy when it comes to ""to do"", tried to go digital several times but never stayed too long until I went back the old-fashioned way. Until I tried todoist. Typing on PC with natural language feels as natural as jotting it down on my book. It syncs instantly with your phone & you can have it show up on your homescreen & you're ready for the day. Or the week.",
"Would like a list to be available, showing dates that repeating tasks were completed on. So I can see in one place all the dates I exercised on for example. That's the only thing I can think of to improve it! Also being able to set the list a new task automatically gets added to would be nice. I never use the inbox list because I know you can't see a list of completed items there. I put everything in a ""to do"" project list so completed tasks don't disappear with no record they ever existed!",
"These guys listen to their customers and I love that. I gave feedback that I wanted the option to close the left hand side menu when I opened up a project, as it was distracting to see it there. Now that's fixed with the new update! (and the tweeks to the ui are good too). I want to thank you guys for listening and taking action on my request. Great work, keep it up!",
"I've used Todoist for years and it's a fantastic app BUT I won't give it more stars unless they show sub-projects under the parent project again, like it is on desktop. **Edit**: I added one more star for having configurable swipe settings, which I really appreciate. This feature allows you to replace swipe-to-right to ""Select"" with ""Done"" which is far more useful.",
"Todoist is probably the best to do list app on the market! I had a lot of problems planning my time and tracking my tasks with a bunch of other apps and none of them worked. Don't have that problem with Todoist though. It's somehow the simplest app and yet has the most features I need. The premium version looks cool with a lot of useful bonus features, though I haven't tried it yet. The only thing I'd like for the app to have is recurring tasks in the pasts, so I hope they add it one day!",
The app continuously force closed after sign in with google account. This is my first time use this app and now i can't use it at all,
"UPDATE: Thanks so much for addressing this problem -- I waited a few hours and did a third reinstall, which seems to have worked! As I mentioned, this is a great app, and I especially love the feature to email tasks to your task inbox from any email address (great if I think of a personal-life task at work and want to quickly note it down without getting out my phone). ORIGINAL REVIEW: I loved this app and the web app. But it's suddenly stopped working on Android. Have reinstalled twice.",
"Good app, but has some anoying features, f.e. I get a notification in the morning about not having any tasks today. That's anoying spam. All I can do is turn off notifications all together.",
"A very beautiful app, chosen for our business, after testing ten's of others. One thing missing that would help users save time, is an option to show 1,2,3, or all lines, of a task's comment. This would not change any of the app's core function, but only improve usability, for those that want comments to show. Please implement. Perfect otherwise!",
"One of the best apps for tasks. However, since the reminder removal update, I wont receive push notifications... For example, when I have a meeting at 2:00PM. My windows or my phone wont notify me about anything when 2:00PM comes. This is very frustrating for me. But, the rest of the features are awesome!",
Like it easy to use ....reminders to my email....can go back to completed list and can set up specific projects. I couldn't figure out how to edit a task on my to-do list without deleting and starting over once it was entered. So this particular feature I did not like. But overall great app,
a very comprehensive app perfect for those who want to get their life organized in all areas,
"Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars.",
"It's amazing for being free, and serves its purpose of decluttering your day to day and things to do from the simplest of tasks to the big goals you wanna reach, there is a premium mode but the free version doesn't have ads and is very intuitive, i love this app and hope it helps keep things stress free and helps remind and do the things i need and want to do. Overall amazing!",
Love it! One of best powerful planning app technology and fully modernized and remodelled to do list design. That app design is just so gorgeous and incredibly beautiful. I really enjoy that app very much.,
"Great app!!! I have tried many different task managers, Todoist is by far the best. It took me some time to understand and configure the app's various customizations, but once done, the app does everything I need. I am able to easily filter between work and personal tasks, so the app provides a one-stop-shop for task management. The multi-leveled projects list is amazing. The online guidance provides comprehensive instructions, so anyone can use the app like a pro. Love it!!!",
"Overall great, except one. I just left the beta because of a certain bug. When you delete the label ""GCal"" (I deleted it because I don't use Google Calendar), the app will just crash the next time you open it. Deleting cache and data will not resolve it. After logging in again, it will crash the next time you open the app. Also, Android DayNight theme and Android 10 Dark Theme ruins the text color on widgets. But, it's still good! Boards helped me a lot. Overall great!",
Latest update doesn't work App stopped working,
"It's a great and amazing app. I have too much great things to say about. Being able to recognize date and type right from entering the task is amazing. One thing though. Please make it easy to create another list that are not actually projects. And make it easy to enter subtask instead of going into the task and selecting a parent task. Overall, I've been using this app for a little over a week, and I'm blown away. It's great.",
"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek.",
"Rather good application, but can someone explain me what is the purpose of adding an unwanted notification just to tell me that I can rest and enjoy peace of mind because I don't have any task to do? That's exactly the opposite of letting me rest and enjoying peace of mind... EDIT: Indeed, I'm referring to the daily digest. Increasing of 1 star because of this commitment to look into the issue",
"I really like this app and how it can also run on web and synchronise smoothly. [However, I am also using a widget on my phone and that always has weird sync problems. Like: if I mark a task completed on the widget or from the app, it doesn't disappear from there, and there is no way to refresh it.] Edit: I'm no longer facing this issue at the moment, but I'll contact you in case I notice it again. Thank you for your reply!",
"Normally great, sometimes things go a bit awry when they expand, I would prefer a tad more stability to stuff but then their customer service is good, and responsive, and got major things to work, such as integration. Key wish would be for direct shortcut to turn current window into a task, rather than three clicks. But they are constantly improving, and still seem ahead of practically all other task managers that I know.",
"Not worth trying this for the reminders as they removed them from the free version. Sure maybe this is worth paying for for all the project management stuff, but for us who just want a very basic Todo list with reminders, this will not work without paying a subscription. I would have paid a once off for this for a basic Todo notifications version, but alas, they want to go too far into the ""as a service"" model.",
"Signed up Dec 30 2020 to get more organized in life for 2021. After 1 day I knew it was a keeper so signed up for the premium account to get all the features I wanted. I find this app and desktop software easy to use and very intuitive and quick to pick up as a new user who was not using a competitor app. I needed software that would work on Android & iPad, and after using it for a few days I can say it works trouble free on both and syncs with no issues.",
"I've been using Todoist for a while, but I've backed off because it's frustrating to work with. It's very difficult to get a good view of to-dos since my day regularly ends after midnight. Other apps have a ""choose your day start/end time"" feature, albeit with less functionality than Todoist. It just strikes me as classist and ableist that this is one of the most requested features & they refuse to add it in.",
"I rarely bother writing reviews for apps, but this one deserves it. I've been able to use it exactly the way I need, and I don't even think I use all of the many available tools. It takes a moment to get used to, but it's worth it. I use the time allocation as an extra way to prioritise along with the colour coding. You can really do a lot with the free version, so unless you have A LOT of stuff on your plate, you can work average tasks into the available projects quite easily. I recommend it 💯",
Bro why it keeps crashing on Android Motorola this is so frustrating,
"Great app, the only thing missing is a timeline function, it would be really helpful visually. It could be easily added by simply adding a start date option to a task, so each task stretches through a time period. It would be a separate section below the calendar, or an alternative view of the calendar.",
"Despite an intuitive interface, and positive initial impression, I was unable to get recurring events to show up properly on my ""upcoming"" calendar. Frustrating to schedule a routine item for ""every weekday at 7am"", see it reflected correctly in the task view, then look at your ""upcoming"" tab to have it only show it on the next day. I could not find any cases of others having this issue online, so maybe I'm just a moron. And morons leave 2-star reviews for things that are their own fault.",
It's a real good app for organising your tasks and setting different times for each tasks. I'm giving 4⭐ because notification is only present in the pro version. Lest I forget 🤩 it also ranks you based on your performance. You can also set your goals like how many goals you wanna achieve every day and week. Finally there are no ads. Trust me it's a nice app.,
"It is pretty good, I use it everyday. However, I think adding recurring tasks is not very intuitive. You have to remember the ""every"" syntax. Some UI would help, especially for new users and non-native English speakers. Other than that, it's a pretty plain to-do list, does not include much gamification to keep you motivated to do what you have to do (other than setting a general goal number of tasks to do in a day or week). Reporting is a premium feature which comes in pretty thin too, you can only see a barchart of how many tasks you've completed each day in the past week or how many tasks you've completed every week in the past 4 weeks. For what it offers, the premium option feels a bit expensive.",
"A really helpful and easy to use app. If you want to feel satisfied by achieving more, then this is the app for you. The free version is very generous. My son is autistic and has problems with time management, memory and focus. He finds this app really helpful. He has the premium subscription to support the developers because of the work they put into it to keep it so good and bug free. Thanks todoist.",
Over all a great app but I have tasks in Google calendar that are set to repeat every 4 weeks but when I sync them to Todoist they adjust to repeat weekly which is frustrating because they needlessly fill up my inbox. I have reported the issue as a ticket but I haven't yet received a reply. If they fix that I will happily buy an annual subscription (currently just trying it for one month).,
"Happily surprised with how amazing this app is. I was a long time user of Wunderlist and was very disappointed to switch over to their new app, Microsoft To Do and find it lacked some essential features I was used to. Todoist covers everything I want in a to do app and even features like connecting to your calendar that I haven't used before. My one hope was that I could sync my Wunderlist 'completed list' but that's my only suggestion.",
"Excellent little app for managing multiple tasklists in different categories, across several platforms. Easy and enjoyable to use and really helps me keep organised and see everything I need and want to get done. Loses a star for the greedy subscription pricing model, otherwise it is perfect for me; simply far too expensive for a simple tasklist manager, so I'll stick with the free version.",
"Amazing app. Definitely my to do app of choice. Wish it had a more robust Calander view, with a proper week view function. It's also increasingly hard to justify the premium, when free equivalents are getting so much better (Google's, apple, microsoft's), and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists (notion). A big gripe for me is that its design & UI is falling a little behind its competitors (things 3, apple reminders); which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app.",
"Absolutely the best to do app out there. Great UI, great features. Use it for general stuff, shared shopping lists and household tasks, projects... everything. Well worth it for the paid version too. The only features I'd like to see are more than once a day scheduling (eg. morning, noon and night; can workaround with multiple tasks) and repeatable projects (think recipes; can workaround with templates but difficult).",
"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",
"Loving your program, I've been using it for years. Thank you for your work! One function in Todoist is very missing - now when I complete a task on the tab ""today"" it disappears completely. However, it is much more convenient when it gets crossed out and goes to the end of the daily task list (like in Google Keep). When you see a task done today, you're very motivated to do more. This may be a paid function, but it's not in any form in the section ""today"" or ""coming"" now.",
"Great app. Some of the features that try to be a little ""smart"" are really annoying at times. Other features that would be useful are behind a pay wall (but reasonably priced). Need to make money to pay for costs so I can appreciate that and the core is free so really can't complain much. Keep up the work, great job :)",
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).",
"Everything WAS alright but then an update happened. I thought it would only affect the visual aspect but no. It causes lots of bugs. I cannot open projects, no tasks are showing in them. Turned on the completed tasks but they don't show. Problems with scheduling. Basically all the main features of the app are completely broken",
Horrible experince. Glitchy and slow with no user friendly interface. Waste of time to download check it out and uninstall after 10 minutes. On top of that the most important features are paid. But wait... its a subscription to pay £4 monthly!! For a todo app which can't do something better than the hundreds free or those with one time payments. Cannot recommend to anyone.,
"Just downloaded this app after trying to find apps which would sync with other people. Finally I found one that is easy to use, accurate, neat and tidy. Only issue I have is with the reminders side of things. I wish the reminders had a ringtone just encase you don't hear the notification tone. But otherwise great app & I recommend it.",
"Subscription based. £50 a year. For a todo list app. No. Imagine you put 10 or 20 similarly priced apps on your phone, you're losing £500 to £1000 per year, the price of a flagship phone! Every year! I'd have paid between £5 and £10 max for this app for the pro features. I'll look elsewhere, I'm not going to encourage this greed.",
"Really handy and has a reoccurring task option. I was looking for this feature and many other apps didn't have it for free. The layout is decently straightforward. There's also theme options. Even a level up system based on tasks completed, which is a good idea and a great motivator(,makes it somewhat game-like). Just what I needed 😁👍🏾",
"The app is great with lots of features. If you are looking for simple to do list or tasks organiser then there are more simple apps. The reason for 3 stars is because the way of setting date and time, can't believe that I have to type: Saturday 23 Jan at 9 am!!! Never seen something like that, why can't it be regular calendar to select from? because of that I'm not able to include any day or tomorrow or yesterday...etc. in my task text, it will straight away captured as due date. Very annoying!!",
"Ad-free, sync with cloud, can manage recurring tasks (interface not suitable for beginners), widget is functional. Premium is very expensive, licence for home-use missing. However the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium. Greatest mistake: no way to backup / export my own data unless I pay. Don't be greedy - it is my data, and you lock it away. Missing auto backup in the free version is OK. But no way to export / download it is a no-go.",
"Editing my review now I've used this more: while I still think it's poor that the website says the free account supports 80 projects, when it is in fact only 5, the app, both on mobile and desktop is excellent. I've adapted to the limitation and found the app to very useful, I particularly like the natural language method of setting due dates/recurring tasks. Still, one star off for the mis-leading messaging!",
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,
"It's alright. The UI feels rather out of date. Moving from one view to another for example feels like a chore. This could be done better by swiping. Since reminders are a premium feature the free version of the app is kind of pointless. It also seems like there is no option for a free trial of the pro version. Paying for an app before I know if Its any good, feels very outdated. Some features are restrictive without reason. For example you cant sort tasks manually in the today view.",
"Slick interface, intuitive.",
A great balance of features without being overly complicated.,
"Can only see completed tasks from last week, not recent completed tasks",
Good app to keep my day on track. Syncs well with other devices.,
"I love the app - it's been so handy for my university classes, I can make a project for each course and subsections with all my assignments. It's great to visualise what is coming up. ONLY downside I have is that I've recently got a new phone and for some reason I get 0 notifications from the app now - I used to get my daily list of tasks for the day, and now I get nothing, even though all my settings look correct. Bit of a shame, and I'm not sure how to fix it.",
"EDIT: After the fair dev reply and reflection, I can't deny Todoist's top quality and effort +1 star :) does what it aims to do very well, perhaps the best. However, I feel users trying to ""become"" organised, aren't going to benefit as much as users who ""already"" are. A little counter intuitive but the app does feel like it's an all in commitment, or nothing (just IMO, after a couple years of use). This may feel like another stressor to some. Again, it's a brilliant addition for the right user.",
"The app is good, but the ""upgrade to pro"" indications are intrusive and distracting. The UI/UX could be improved, and the customization options are too complex. Features are added without considering how they will interact with other features, which can cause problems. For now, I'm better off with the bare bones Google tasks with an awesome calendar integration. Plus, there I don't have to pay for reminders. Would have loved to have todoist lite pro with just the essential features.",
Was a great app the past 4 to 5 years that I've used it. But recently it kept crashing I'd reinstalled it twice. But the issue continued. It's been annoying when the crash window pops up in the middle of a task. I hope that there's a bug fix,
"If you sign up for this app, understand you will received excessive emails, without the ability to actually unsubscribe. I have tried REPEATEDLY, yet still receive emails weekly or more. I just tried again, marked no to everything, only to receive a ""tips and tricks"" email literally one minute later. I will never reconsider using this app after this bs.",
"Personally, for me, this is the best app for organizing my to-dos and basically my daily life! Plus it's accessible from many devices, which I rly need and so I rly love this app! Suggestion: a like label that can be seen on the front screen with the task would be a great addition! And maybe for visual aesthetic, a customizable background? Overall, it's definitely a great app! 😄 thanks!",
"Best app I have ever used. Sensational. Basically I've always found it frustrating that neither Google tasks or microsoft to-do don't sycn up with Google calendar. THIS DOES! Also, what is great is that you don't see re-occuring tasks keep on repeating themselves on the task list (but they do appear when the day comes, and they show up on the Google calendar!!!). Honestly this app is amazing, what's more is that its completely free with no ads. You can also pay for the premium features!",
"Does everything i want it to do. Interface efficient and intuitive. A nice dark layout option that's easy on the eyes. love the feature of writing in the date or day and in automatically assigns it to that date. Motivated by the points system, as primal as that is. In short helping a lot on journey to productity.",
Todoist is my go to get-your-you-know-what-together app. It's super customizable which I really like. Also like being able to see my events/to-do's for the upcoming week. Only complaint is I wish there was a sort of calendar view where I could see a month at a time. I still use a paper calendar for that.,
"The app used to work fine for me until a few months ago I no longer get any notifications. I've fiddled with Android notification settings, app settings, reinstalling, and so on, but nothing worked. I'm able to fire a 'preview' from the app, but it doesn't come in on the time scheduled. Hopefully an isolated issue, but I can't rely on this at all anymore.",
You want me to pay $5 a month to use reminders... On a to-do list app? Lol,
"Lazy tech support. Just can't be bothered. Took down my initial adverse review to give tech support a chance to sort things out. They just couldn't be bothered. I'm using Nine email and having a problem sharing with Todoist when I want to create a task using an email. Sometimes it works, more often it doesn't. However sharing with Wunderlist works every time! Todoist tech support answer: sort it out yourself with Nine! UPDATE. After numerous emails to tech support they still haven't bothered.",
It has a bit more complexity than a simple todo list and feels more natural to use. I really like it. I just read eat that frog and i'm using my todoist to make plans and stuff. Plus you can make it pink or whatever colour you like and check on your activity log for a sense of satisfaction. The pro version is a tad expensive but it's important so you just have to put up with that. The free version isn't bad though.,
"The app is amazing and easy to use. I am finding that I am able to manage my time and activities efficiently and having more time on my hand that I am previously used to. Its also great because i can access it on all my devices. The app is an amazing concept, however it is disappointing that the free version is alot more limited that I thought. That being said it is an amazing tool to have at all times. I would recommended it to anyone and everyone.",
"I've found the app through Hannah Witton on YouTube, and have been using it for the past two weeks. It's really neat, you can setup an event entirely through texts, setting up priority, what category you want to put it under and when it should be done or to work on it. All those features are free, and there's more if you want to pay for it. (I'm a free user)",
"Just what I needed to Master My Day! I have been using Todoist for less than a year now and it has been better than what I had expected. It's constantly updated and useful new features are added regularly. It's easy to use, intuitive, integrates with most major apps or softwares you would need and looks great. The most important part to using it effectively is to be committed to doing the tasks you write down on this app (or any other app for that matter).",
"The widget scrolling messes up my home screen. I am on Oneplus, scrolling the widget makes me unable to use the swipe up gesture to open the app drawer. All other scrollable widgets work fine.",
I'm sure it would have been a great app but I'm tired of having to log in with e-mails and so on just for simple apps like tick lists. Sorry but unfortunately I'll download an other one. Good day.,
Free version doesn't have notifications for REMINDERS! What a scam! What is the point of having this app if it doesn't have freaking reminders? Like that's literally the entire point of this app. Shame on you guys.,
"The app shouldn't send a notification if no tasks are due today - there should only be a notification if there ARE tasks. Huge flaw to be unable to differentiate, functions more as spam and advertisement for the app.",
"Its a wonderful app, very helpful and organised, perfect and simple listing and task viewer, Just one more thing and the app will be 10/10, Would you please enhance the possibility to move subtasks to another project subtasks?",
"My tasks are done, done and done. The app is great.. really nice customisation has the features that help me focus on my tasks and finish them.",
I really like this app but printing tasks or subtasks feature is only available on desktop version app or web version only. Rest Perfect App for all Reminders,
Todoist is a really great Todo and Note app. It comes before Evernote in my workflow. You can make a Zapier connection to move a note from Todoist to Evernote. That's really great.,
"Wake me up when you finally be able to mark tasks as done in-place (Green check, Crossed out, greyed out, stay visible, stay in the same place) 😴💤 + Option to ""Reset"" my account to wipe everything clean as if new without deleting it.",
NOT FREE! You have to pay $77 a year for the most basic feature.. Reminders. That's right. There are No reminders! Unfortunately I am forced to go elsewhere.,
"If you're having trouble with the last update causing your widget to flash, just go into the app settings and log out of your account and back in. That fixed it for me.",
"minimalist, but also feature packed. doesn't push premium subscription stuff in your face either. all around great app!",
I've been a paying user for many years but looking for something better now. Reminders are only reminding sometimes since recent updates. Very disappointed.,
"Came as preinstalled bloat. Decided to open it and see if it was any good. I logged in, and immediately began receiving spam from them in my email.",
I'm really impressed. Full use of the features of this app has increased my productivity and satisfaction significantly. I no longer start things I never finish.,
"Todoist is a really good app and I think it is underrated. Since I downloaded it , it has helped me a great deal in not forgetting things . It is simple , fun and easy to use . Thank you for this app",
"It is great app for tasks listing and keeping track of things, but whenever i try to search for the widget my oneUI home keeps stopping, please look into this problem...",
Installed this app to see if I would like it and didn't use it so I uninstalled it the next day. Now I get emails and emails and emails. I don't need reminders about tasks I do not have. I don't even have this app installed nor do I use it.,
Just add full screen reminders like alarms and it will be perfect And if possible lower the price a bit just a little bit,
"So far it's alright, but the due dates are killing me. It literally says that you can do every 2 weeks, but it will not apply that or anything like it. Only certain days of the week, or a specific date.",
"This is a great app! The integration with Google Calendar is also a great feature, though it would be nice if it could ""strike through"" the event in Calendar once the item is marked complete in Todoist. In the way it is built right now you need to choose if you want to just keep or delete the Calendar events corresponding to completed tasks.",
Garbage app. The worst? Maybe. Clearly the result of Microsoft hiring for diversity not talent or qualifications which is company wide and why they haven't done anything good in 20 years,
"The best cross-platform to do application that works on all devices possible. Also, it's worth the premium subscription.",
"I was very much enjoying this app, then a new update came in that has made it almost useless to me. I thought it was a visual change but now I cannot even save my reminders or anything and putting in a date is so difficult because if it doesn't like the way you put it in it just does not register as a date. I may change my opinion if they fix these issues but I may have to find something else if they don't.",
"Non-usable Don't bother I tried this app as a replacement to my current tasks app that I've used for years. I was looking for a task list that was always up to date on all devices. However it has not stopped crashing since I installed it. Both my phone and tablet experience the same problem. Seems to be when I am trying to drag and drop. Anyhoo, I'm still using my current app which is heads and shoulders above Todoist, both in usability and features.",
The app is unusable due to constant crashes since recently.,
This app seems great. However I switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium. What the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually. They should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf. Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.,
"Great app, easy to use with friendly interface and customise options. But didn't stick to it for personal use as free version lacks essential features (like reminders, history, backup, limited labels, etc.). I think paid version has to offer something on top of free standard features (included to pre-installed Google apps) not charging for them.",
"the app is functional and the widget is very handy but the subscription model cost feels a bit much for all of the use I get out of it. I'd be much happier if it was a bit cheaper and when you consider some of the other free options that are out there, paying so much for so little feels like a bit of a con.",
"Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version. Gave up in frustration when I realized that to be actually useful I'd have to pay extra.",
"The functionality is excellent, it all seems good except the wearOS version does not have a tile, i want my watch with a list of the highest priority task and the one with the closest deadline, the first 5 tiles are the one i visit the most, and i NEED a tile, i need to have that list in front of me as much as possible, otherwise is very difficult for me to actually do my tasks and i just ignore them. This app NEEDS a watch tile or i will simply ignore it like all the other task apps i have used",
"The natural language processing is actually a game changer, not even kidding. I can type (or voice type) what I need to do and when, assign it priority if I need to, and set up recurring tasks eg ""for the next 3 Sundays"", all in a single field. You can edit it later but it makes it so much less effort to add things, which is important for something that's supposed to make life easier. Also the widget is really good, I have one home page with it full screen and I barely need to open the app",
"Why is it so hard to respond to a query email? I emailed you days ago to ask where ""completed tasks"" go, but to no response!",
"This app is amaizing. Best by far. I so regret spending money on other todo apps. For this one i am ready to pay about 20-30 euro per month, and it's only 3 euro per month. Everything is synced, app is constantly 60fps no lag no crashes. You can have it on PC, on phone, as browser extension and even on freaking smart watch. It has everything I ever would want from todo app. Documentation is very easy to read and takes about 2 minutes and you already know everything you need. It has a tonn of functionality but somehow manages to keep everything plain simple. Thank you for that app.",
"IMO, this is the best to-do app I have ever had the pleasure to use in my entire life! They have mobile and desktop versions for multiple platforms, and it also syncs with Alexa and likely Google Home too. Thank you so much to the developers behind this! Just wish there was an option for a pay-once lifetime premium membership. This is a great app, I really love it.",
"I like the way you're able to schedule the alarm using key words around the due date. Very convenient. Friggin awesome, man. This was the main feature that kept me from going back to any.do The alarms didn't seem to pop up enough for me to notice. Wat the fug. Tbh, I may have dismissed the notifications or I was put to sleep. Would try full version if trial was offered. Can't remember if it was offered with the account I originally created with :-)",
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist.",
"To do items, arranged into projects, can be one off or repeating and can optionally be assigned a date (e.g. a fortnightly reminder on a given day to put out your recycling for collection, a shopping list without dates). Relative days are automatically detected - e.g. ""tod"" for today, a generally helpful feature until you try to remember to call Tom, which results in an item ""call"" for the next day. Handy voice assistant integration to add items to your shopping list while preparing a meal.",
"I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me. It has too slim lines even without compact mode (compact is ridiculous, even though I have small fingers), the quick button to open the main app is gone and the WORST - it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them. Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track.",
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.",
"Awesome App. keeps me organized and helps me complete tasks every day. Also it doesn't nag me if I wasn't able to complete a certain task that day, it automatically moves the uncompleted task to the next day. Update : App worked fantastic until today when it stopped adding new tasks and continues to say in a pop-up message that I had reached the maximum limit and that I should upgrade to premium to be able to continue using app. I do not wish to upgrade!",
"I really like this app. I use if as a widget on my phone so I can easily see what else I have to do for the day. BUT, I recently got a fit bit versa 3, and the apps will not sync. I keep getting the ""getting started"" orange screen, asking me to allow permission for fit for todoist app on the fitbit app. Everyone is switched to on, and it won't work. Even paid for the Fitbit app. Deleted both todoist apps, turned off both devices and still nothing. I emailed the app yest., waiting on responss",
"You have to pay for reminders, and I think that's stupid. Every single other app in the world sends me push notifications I DON'T want, and now, in the context of an app that keeps track of tasks you have to get done, notifications telling you to do those tasks are a premium service? Seriously, give me a break... I'll just use Google Keep Notes after all...",
So it might not seem fair to rate this app based solely on how it runs on the computer but I need a to do list to work on both and the computer app straight up does not work. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and restarted my computer with no success.,
"Disspointing and unprofessional. No ability to restore deleted tasks or projects. Not even on Pro accounts. I accidently deleted my list. 100% user error, no doubt about it. My bad. There is no ability to either undo your deleted item or get it back out of a trash folder and restore it. The only method to do this is via a ‘backup’ which only occurs on Pro accounts… but EVEN WITH a Pro account the backup only occurs at 00:00 daily. Meaning even with a Pro account if you delete something its gone.",
"I was looking for an app that kept my to do list untill completed and thought I'd give this one a try. Install it, log in with Google, first thing it shows; my thesis as task for 2018. Well I'm sure the app does what I am looking for. e ✨ Edit: One star off, it misses one crucial function. A repeat button for reoccuring tasks. Esit 2: Thanks for the advice.",
"Exactly, you just focus on what we did (and it makes sense, of course). Although, I think that to give us more insight about what we didn't do would be really good. I mean, just an option to mark tasks as ""uncompleted"" and show that in the statistics and this app would be even better. To let the app know what I really did from all that stuff that I scheduled for the week, for example, or even for the month would really give us rich information about how productive we have really been.",
"This app has so many features that at first I worried it was making things LESS productive; with so many different ways you can categorize items, comment on tasks, add files, set reminders, etc., I wondered if I was spending more time assigning myself tasks than I would just writing stuff down in a calendar! But after playing with it for a bit and streamlining how to best use the app for my purposes, I find it hugely useful. The integration with Google calendar is also super handy.",
very useful for teamwork & schedule planning at work,
"Such an awesome app! I used it for a while and eventually moved onto something else trying out new features. I came back to Todoist after about a year and the experience on Samsung phones is so much better than almost every other productivity app out there!! I immediately went for the paid version, well done devs! Those late nights are really paying off! Very very good experience! 👍🏼",
"I liked the app, I wanted to apply premium but the problem was the widget, sometimes it freezes; whenever i click the task/note the options won't activate so I would have to open the app itself. And lastly it would be amazing if you can insert options to customize the widget settings, e.g. change default fonts, customize the widget line spacing and etc. If this happens I will surely apply for a year subscription",
"way too many buttons to press go get a quick list done ""automatic"" unwanted re-odering of sub-tasks, really annoying in daily lists ms to do is way more efficient",
"Great app, super-useful at what I use it for (reminding me to do stuff/suggesting good times to procrasniate until 😂). Even better if you use the desktop website with it too, if you spend time sitting in front of a PC anyway (like I do). Probably even better if you pay for premium (there are premium features, I don't pay for them). Just about the most recent update, is there any chance of getting some more in-depth notification settings? I really appreciate the ability to get both emails, and push notifications, cos i check my email on my phone and my PC hahaha",
"Best to do app I've used so far. I use it as a simple way to note down distracting tasks I want to do later as well as a pseudo-scheduling app. It's easy to stay organized using projects and the due date feature help me keep on track with upcoming deadlines. Overall, it's helped me from forgetting important things I need to get done, and also focus better.",
"A couple of questions before I re-install the app: 1. Do I have to un-install it first? 2. Will I lose any of my data if I un-install the app (I have entered a lot of tasks which I don't want to re-enter) Thanks for your help. Hi Doist! OK, I reinstalled your app and the good news is that all my ToDos are still there after I logged in! The bad news is that after turning on the Task Complete Tone on ""Mobile"", the app would make that sound about 3 seconds after I closed it, every single time. Turning off the tone did not stop it sounding each time I closed the app. But, after rebooting the phone with the Tone turned off, the app stopped sounding the tone when I closed it. So it's nice and quiet now! My phone is Android 6.",
"The concept idea is really good, but navigating the app is extremely confusing. Even after reading through their help page twice I could not figure out how to perform even the simplest of tasks, and quite a lot of useful tools are hidden behind a paywall. I downloaded the app in the hopes of easing my stress, the last hour has been nothing but stress with this app and I have accomplished nothing.",
"Something wrong with latest update? Android widgets are flickering, deleting and re-adding doesn't help.",
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards.",
"Super easy to use! I have the business account and I highly recommend it, especially if you have a team for projects. Also, I love the Google calendar integration, makes my workflow much better as I am constantly informed of my upcoming tasks wherever I look! Only thing is would be nice to have start/finish times but other than that great 😁",
"Is setting reminders and labels really worth being a premium feature? In my opinion the app is literally useless without them. If it was a $5 one time purchase then maybe it would be fair, but $48 per year is ridiculous. All of the premium features are easy to emulate with apps that came with my phone. I hate how even the simple apps have to be subscription based nowadays, even for something as simple as a bloody to do list.",
Best todo list app in the market. I've been using it for years and it's worth every penny that I pay for the premium subscription. Love this app.,
"Been using it for a day and love it. Already thinking of upgrading BUT the free version works perfectly fine for now. One thing i would change is to have a change to show added time of task on the note (you can see it under three dots for the task but if i could press an option to see it on the task itself without extra click would love it), like an option from settings.",
"Nice look and feel but integrations are random and hopeless. Syncing with Google calendar either doesn't work at all or creates endless duplicates. Which have to be deleted individually. The lack of integrated time recording is annoying. There are other alternatives with fewer issues. After a couple of pandemic years perseverance, I've moved on",
"It's so handy to be able to make notes on the go. I find the app very easy to use and I like being able to separate tasks into projects, prioritise and reschedule, as needed. I don't need reminders at the moment, so haven't gone premium, but can see how that would be useful.",
I think it is the best app I could ever tried It has helped me get more organized. in the short future I will upgrade. thank you Todoist.,
"The new update is hard to use. It is taking up more time to go through projects because the 'see all' is at the bottom and I have to click it. What usually takes 2 seconds swiping, takes 5. It may not be a lot but frankly, it reduces the enthusiasm to go through different projects. Not a fan.",
"Looking at the features and lots of accolades I tried uninstalled after just a trial. Reason: In the free version notification feature is missing. If the task misses the set time, there is no notification. We will come to know only if we open the app. Insanely Ridiculous. Not sure what have the product team thought while excluding such a basic feature.",
Perfect!!! This app is exactly what I was looking for. I purchased the Edge panel companion as well for easy access. It has all the features I was looking for in a to-do type app. The dark grey is great - only upgrade would be an AMOLED black theme option. Keep up the great work!,
"The best productivity app ever. After adding today's tasks widget to my phone's main screen (Android), adding a 1-click button to record a task into Inbox, adding a GMail plugin to convert emails into tasks and setting up recurring habits and prioritization labels -> I now have much more peace of mind and results on all the small errands that used to drag on and then result in bigger problems when not solved. Love how the guides linked in the app teach you to have a simple yet reliable system!",
"The homepage should have the option to view just the tasks for the day (without the overdue tasks - those can be in another tab/list). Sometimes what i want is just a clean canvas to plan my day but i open this app & am reminded of the ton of things i didn't do :'-) There should also be an option to select multiple tasks & delete them all at once (i forgot about the app, but the web version doesn't seem to be able to do this & i have to manually delete tasks one by one to get that clean canvas)",
"the app is good and I've switched to it from TickTick but then i switched to Microsoft Todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing. don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd. maybe fix the design, add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great",
"Excellent todo tracker! Very fast on start up, super clean and tidy. I especially love the karma feature, which compares the completed daily tasks. However having the reminder feature under the paid features (which is a fairly steep price) is a no+go for me. But i encoirage people to check it out, since apart from that, it's just excellent at what it does",
"Love the app.....had issues with it stopping syncing with Alexa ToDo list, meaning I had to delete items in both Alexa lists, and Todoist lists, then delete the lists in Todoist, and set up to sync again. Since doing that it seems to be working. Impressed the developer contact me to check whether it was working. The programme and app are both brilliant, and very customisable.",
"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list. It was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes.",
"Thanks god I found your application! I'm very satisfied with how I can manage multiple goals, not just daily but also long term goals in diferent aspects like work, health, improvement and so on. Your gadget is very configurable and I can sort as I want 🥰 the integration with google calendar is everything I could ask for. And all of this is free!!!! All the rest I just a great plus to a beautifly thought product. You rocks!!!",
This is a great app and I am getting a lot more done than I was before. The only downside is that the premium subscription is a little pricey for a todo app. Seems like a lot of companies are opting for subscriptions to keep the gravy train coming instead of allowing us to buy the app outright. I'd rather own it outright than pay every year or month.,
"I love this app! Easy to figure out, you can add tasks, sub-tasks, sections, and projects so you can organize everything into smaller pieces so your to-do list doesn't feel so overwhelming. The website is great but the app and widgets are equally useful. Would recommend to anyone who needs a new way to keep track of their to-do list.",
"Subscription is to expensive for supported features. It is not easy to oversee all the things gooing on. I could not create ""subsections"" in my personal routines section to keep things stuffed. Also it is not possible to mark something as ""not done"". Especially for reoccuring routines this would make perfectly sence. Another rather bad thing is, that it is not easy to analyze progress or precission. Especially for routines a statistical analysis would be good. Also a visualization for due dates.",
"I wish this app could STFU a little bit. The purpose of a to do list is to courage you to do your stuff, not to check every unnecessary pings and emails. I was looking around the app, making simple tasks to get the feel, and then I got bunch of emails every few hours. Two days later I finally had time to find email notifications checklist in settings. 4 out of 5 email notification types that help NOTHING with what you do. Wow. Just set it off on default, everyone hates spammy apps.",
"I was delighted by this app. Hence, i went for the premium subscription. There are two things i request the developers to look into. 1. There must be a proper notification. Better if we get some kind of alarm kind of notification. Right now, the notification feature is not that effective. 2. I have done integration with the Google Calendar. But if you put a task on a particular date and time, it is added in the calendar as an one hour task by default. Later, i go to the calendar to change it",
"I've gone through many apps. This is a very flexible app - really comfortable to create tasks, projects and goals! Has both web and app versions. I would probably call the projects section something different because it could be every day routines, study goals, work projects etc. Nevertheless I was looking for that category/feature and it's the only app that provides with such clever and simple user interface! Thank you!",
No notifications even after allowing notifications,
i love this application. it's very handy for your daily study routine. I'm sure others can benefit loads from this todoist.,
"On limited trial, it was not intuitive to use and the paid version is required to set a reminder. The app should just be a paid app only then. What's the use of this app without the ability to set a simple reminder? With so many task list apps out there, I've been going through trying them out and this one was a quick uninstall.",
"I use Todoist every day for work. It's easy to use and very handy! In one click, I turn a mail into a task linked to a project. I enjoy getting a feedback of my productivity at the end of the year, when Todoist gives me all the stats about the tasks achieved, the number of projects, etc. Keep up the good work!",
"This is the best to-do app I've used due to the subtask power. For example, I can assign due dates for individual subtasks in addition to the main task. This is extremely beneficial in managing one's time. Also, the inbox is, in my opinion, brilliant. I can input, via voice recognition , a task that needs to be done. I don't know when I can get to it and I don't know how I want to categorize it. So, I put it in the inbox to be scheduled and categorized when time permits. Projects are great also.",
"I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product.",
"I love this app! It's exactly what I needed for my new business to keep me on track. It's really easy to use and has so many features. Because my tasks are so complicated I signed up for premium, but it's only a few dollars a month which is so worth it to me to keep up. I wanted the color coding and labeling for tasks within a project as well as the notifications which is what premium gives me. But even just the basic one I think would be really good for just regular every day to do lists.",
"Have been having issues since last update, when adding a to do, it defaults to go to the inbox folder, instead of going right to 'today' list. So have been forgetting to do stuff because I didn't see it lol. 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed. EDIT: Sane thing happens when I am on today tab and have it set as homepage .",
I absolutely love this. Especially the karma thing. It just makes me want to get to the next karma level. Almost like a video game where I have to try max out my character by completing tasks. What would be cool though is if there was some kind of seperate thing where you can tick off your breaks. (Because breaks are important),
"Wonderful app I've used and happiliy paid for for years now. Unfortunately, the quick capture is not working effectively. On my phone (android 12) it tends to crash when trying to quickly create tasks, for example: - click shortcut to camera -> make picture -> click on share into task -> Todoist crashes. Or seem to get stuck in loading task info, for example when: Create new task via widget -> go to task via shortcut 'show' that appears right after adding a task. Help is appreciated (:",
"A nice, solid, basic app for tasks. I enjoy the features of being able to have different projects, priorities and easy scheduling. The push notification doesn't seem to work unless I've recently opened the app, so usually I get a notification of the day's tasks after I've already opened the app to check manually. I'm on a Huawei android. That's a big minus unfortunately.",
The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.,
"Fantastic app and the best on the market for to do lists! I've not come across a platform that automatically groups my tasks for today in one easy to find place. Not even Google or Microsoft can do this! I link my account to every device I have including my WearOS watch. I used to use Google Tasks and you'd think Google would include their own tasks app onto their watches but no! Since then, I've converted to todoist and I've not been disappointed! I use it daily to keep up with all my tasks!",
"Been using the app every day for years to track everything I need to get done from day to day. One of my favorite apps. It's likely my #1 most used app. Easy to use. Update: Since the radio buttons were added to mark tasks as complete, Im findind that sometimes tasks are accidentally being remived from my list. Not a fan of the radio buttons! - too easy to accidentally click in them.",
"Love the app. I especially appreciate being able to drag and sort so easily. Completed task can be hidden or displayed. The options on how to organize projects are wonderful. Filters, labels, color coding, it's all there. Def would recommend.",
"Great way to keep track of what you need to do. Task streaks and karma are a good incentive to get things done. I use the standard free version which is good for setting, planning and completing tasks. My husband uses premium because he thinks its worth paying for a well made useful app. Our productivity has gone up significantly since we started using the app.",
"You need to pay to get something as basic as reminders (specifying time of the task). Just make the app fully premium. Disgusting, how phone app creators try to squeeze anything out of you for the most basic things, that no one in their right mind would ask money for on a pc. 50 eur a year for this basic app! That's half of what I pay for Photoshop.",
"I used the app for about 3 days before realizing it wasn't a good fit for me. I wanted to use the widget more than the app itself, but I was frustrated with the way recurring events and subtasks work. I even checked reddit and online for a solution, but without success. Instead of listing subtasks as same priority as the parent task during scheduling, I wanted things to remain nested and recurring. After attempting to make things work, I gave up and tried TickTick instead, which has been better!",
"Needed a good list for Wear OS use only (no phone), and this was almost perfect --- except there's no confirmation when marking a list item complete, so it's really easy to accidentally remove an item unintentionally, and it's impossible to undo a completion from the watch interface. So close, and yet so far.",
This app is great for helping me to stay organized. Seeing the number of overdue tasks plus tasks for the day helps me to look realistically at how I need to manage my time to avoid getting overwhelmed. It has been a game changer for me and I would recommend Todoist to anyone who struggles with time management and staying organized.,
This app has changed a lot since i last reviewed it and has done life saving properties. The recurring properties are the most helpful and also on desktop smart date recognition. The options for recurring dates has allowed me to schedule so many things and then just forget about them until later... it has made me more conscientious .,
Really helpful and awesome tool to have. Love that I can just reschedule things to different dates when I don't get around to them! Has definitely made it feel like life is more manageable when I can just add something as I think about it and schedule it to the most appropriate date... helps me not feel overwhelmed under an avalanche of things to do! Great app :),
"started using the app recently so I thought I'd give a review of my first impressions!! really useful, not very simple to use at first, but gets easier as you understand how it works. I really wish there was an option to see done tasks?? I could be wrong but I'm under the impression that when you select ""done"" they're gone for ever.",
"its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list",
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.",
"its kind of odd, imo, that a todo app doesnt automatically include notifications unless you pay for premium. however they do offer integration into my calendar app, which DOES notify me, after a fashion. the widget allows you to switch between all sorts of views. love the natural language for setting thibgs up, general ease of adding a task and categorizing it, the ""postpone"" feature i just discovered, ease of editing, reoccurring subtasks can have different intervals than the overarching task..",
"I have been using this app for over an year and I haven't found any feature that I wanted to use but couldn't find in the app. You can create projects, timelines, set priorities, sync tasks & schedules with your calendar, set reminders, add sub tasks, put up task description and so much more... Just start using and you will never be disappointed.",
"It is the BEST 'lists and tasks app' I have used. As a person who functions around organised lists, I would say it meets all my needs in a 'lists and tasks app'. The schedule settings, subtask options, sections are all very helpful. Even the free version is great. It would have been perfect for me if it had a 'notes' option (I haven't found such an option). Overall a great app. Will continue using.",
"This app makes my life easier! Very comprehensive features, consistent, stable and, above all, easy to use. I had been long searching for a powerful, networked, yet straightforward app to do project management that would include my team members. Nothing fitted the bill until I found Todoist. The fact that I can use it on mobile or desktop makes it even more versatile! This one is among my 3 favorite apps. Big thank you to the developers... keep up the good work, guys!",
"Best to do list app! After wunderlist, anydo and others Todoist is the simplest and best one. The interface is minimal and clean and adding tasks is a breeze thanks to the many shortcuts and smart text recognition of dates. Premium gives some nice extra features but they are definitely not required to use this app.",
"I'm now having issues with the widgets. When I click any button on the task widgets it does not pop up any main program or settings menu, it was working like yesterday and suddenly stopped working now. I tried to remove and add back the widget and restart my device but the problem still exists. It does not affect too much on using the app but now I have to find my app in my folder instead of click it from the home screen. Bit inconvenient :(",
"I regret not using this app sooner. It felt so relieving when I know I can integrate it with other apps, it makes me easier to track my tasks, not every to-do list app can do this 😣. It has a simple and pleasing design but with various and powerful features, it's a complete all-in-1. I've been a fan of making to-do lists for years and Todoist is by far the best app for it ❤️",
I love this app. It's very well thought out. One suggestion is to have a bubble that can float over other apps for adding new tasks. Quite often I'm reading from texts or emails and having to bounce back and forth to/from the Todoist app. A floating bubble would make it much easier.,
"Pretty good app for task management. The natural language processing makes it really easy to add new tasks on the go without having to do much to keep them organized. The all already supports Material You internally if you're into it so it looks nice too, it's a shame It hasn't adopted the dynamic icon yet, it's one of the few missing on my home screen",
"PREVIOUSLY: The best to-do app by a million billion miles! I have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability- excellent system. 26/10/19 UPDATE: This major update to your app is, for me, unfortunately counter intuitive, poor and makes my life harder! I like enhancements to apps but sometimes, as in this case, fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse. Many of the new ""features"" make the app worse!",
"Please get rid of the check mark boxes or give us an option to opt back to swiping. Other than that, I've been using and loving this app for years! It is exactly what I need as a college student, worker, mom, and just someone who likes keeping household tasks in order. I could only love this app and widget more if you got rid of those check mark boxes, please! I accidentally hit like 5 items in one day alone. thanks!",
Desktop version is not native software. I think it runs on electron. No desktop widget features. Ticktick desktop version has more features than this one and also bit cheap(not much just saying). Also there is no reminder for free version. So no chance to see if reminders works perfectly before subscription. Anyways since it lacks so many feature I uninstalled it.,
"By far the best task management app I have used, and i have tried A LOT both professionally and personally. The integration with google calendars is a life saver, there are a lot of options that I always wished for in other apps (sharing with other people, repeating tasks, multiple projects, easy to move between projects, SUPER low maintenance). Bought premium immediately and deleted all my other task apps.",
"Has almost all of the functionality I wanted out of a to-do list. The sentence interpretation towards repeated tasks is intuitive and well implemented. More nebulous tasks such as ""first weekend of the month"" don't seem to work, but that's a minor issue given the robust nature of the rest of the app.",
"Great simple app ! I have free version now. I probably need to get the premium version to duplicate and move tasks. Some questions : Does it allow the moving or duplicating of subtasks to another task ... or the elevating of a subtask to be a task or vice versa. Also, are reminders sent as notifications or sound or both.? Also, does it keep a log of completed tasks and/or subtasks. and if so, can you view or export it in some way? With these features it's a 5 ⭐ app❗",
"I tried all calendar and tasks apps to organise my lists before finalising Todoist! Todoist manages to assign subtasks and is flexible with way you schedule them. The interface is just right for engagement and it is available for all modes - web/browser, windows and android which worked amazingly well for me for now. Hope the app design doesn't change much. Kudos!",
"It's a great productivity tool but with reminders behind an expensive per month paywall, it lacks probably the most important function. I'd try something else, despite the great UI It's a good app, I'd pay for it if it was a one off payment but €30 a year? That's too much.",
"I have a notes app built into my phone that I use. I researched and found an article where someone tried 4 different to do list options. This one sounded best to me, as most people, like me, usually have their phone right there. But my notes app also has where I can put things in the order I'd like to do them. If you can add that feature, I'll try again.",
It checks the devices network connectivity before attempting to connect to the service. This causes an error which prevents people with perfectly functional internet from connecting to the app for no reason. So few apps have this issue & I didn't expect such poor app design from a large company like ToDoIst. This could be fixed in 10 - 20 minutes.,
"I deleted the app(because i was not using it) but right after I deleted the app it starts sending me emails on my account almost, one mail daily ""You have no tasks due today, but you do have 6 overdue tasks. It's okay to reschedule, delegate and even delete tasks! Give it a try. It's liberating...""",
"I've used Todoist nearly every day for two years. As a student, I start every semester by adding sections for my classes (plus a misc section) and filling them out based on the syllabus. I tell people ""if it's not on my todo list, I will forget about it."" I love how I can make tasks in seconds or spend more time to add a due date, section, label, priority, and subtasks. I can add an assignment when a professor mentions it then add details later. I couldn't get my degree without this app.",
"Unintuitive. Every day tasks get scheduled one day over if you didn't complete them. Sucks for daily routines. Also sorting doesn't carry over to ""today"" list and subtasks will be displayed separately on ""today"" tab, so you cant check them off under main task one at a time. No options to fix those behaviours, nonsense.",
"I have the premium version, but the app doesn't show the (added future) repeating tasks. I've tried typing in, ""every 25th"", ""every 25th of the month"", etc. and I only end up with the one reminder displayed. However, Google Calendar DOES work--consistently and easily--with setting and SHOWING repeating reminders. Please tell me how to have all the future reminders appear in the upcoming months. Once this issue is fixed, I will consider 5-stars because it's an otherwise nice organizational tool.",
"Todosit is the great to do list in the market... It's native typing based creation is the my favorite one.. But, still I am looking some additional feature which are mandatory (imo) for better scheduling. They should extend to show the repeated task for atleast week rather than a day.. I am bit struggling whenever I am looking weekly overview. The second one is, time boxing.. Always I need to search some other tools for time boxing",
Great app but too pricey for students unfortunately.,
"This app has been indescribably useful to me. Todoist brings a multifaceted solution the daily struggles of ADHD–struggles that are hard to convey to the people around me. They have a library of helpful guides, templates & intuitive features that together create clearly defined structure I so desperately need–with the flexibility to move on when I inevitably become stuck. Plus, these ingenius shortcut keys give me the speed to keep up with my ever-changing train of thought.",
"Update; The app crashes after the update, any update soon regarding this problem? I just wanna say that this app really deserves every bit of 5 stars. I love how the app was changed but in a good way. The free feature stuffs is really amazing. The karma mode is what makes this app attractive for me. It motivates me to finish my task and achieve the most high. Been using since 2019, and I can say that I have really improved. Finished 1560+ tasks. 🤗",
"Everything is just *chef's kiss* you people'always try to keep the app up to date and perfect almost all the times. I'm an advocate of this app. I would further more appreciate it, if you would give a better experience for android tablet, the web app is perfect, its just that the application doesn't takes use of the more screen real estate in a tablet it looks like a stretched version of mobile app If you could etter optimize it for tablets to give the that todoist experience they get on web app",
Having one place for all my lists and projects has been really enjoyable. I would probably like the premium better for more accurate and times reminders but otherwise the basic todoist app is really nice. Being able to share a project with my hubby is helpful so we can split up during shopping while checking off the same list.,
"Too greedy on the premium features. I'm not going to pay monthly for the ability to add a description/comment to my task. Without this, you have a one liner for the task. There are tons of alternatives that do the same things as this app. I tried this one, the premium features don't interest me and the rest isn't worth a subscription.",
"I love this app, but it's not as user friendly as on a laptop.",
best to do list app EVER !! i've often switched between apps but i had this for the longest time. it's very friendly and easy to use and i lovee the design. it's perfect as a phone widget too and it can be accessed easily. what i like the most is that it syncs to different devices very well and quickly. also has nice features to help organize things so it wont be cluttered,
"This app really is my favorite task list. I previously used todoist a year ago but wanted to try out google notes for the sake of keeping all the services under one google product. I really made an effort to get used to google notes but it just wasn't cutting it. todoist is so cool and awesome, my favorite feature is the option of a widget when you swipe down from the top, anyways, just wanted to say IM BACK!!!",
"I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.",
"you must be thinking, it's just a note-taking app. how different can different note taking apps can be at all? Nope. it's the subtleties and details where they've really worked up. instead of selecting the project i want to enter, just add a #. and it detects reminders very well also. Awesome app.",
"It's an okay app but not what I was looking for. Very complicated. Also don't think it's a good idea to send emails to your customers every single day, tips or anything, they're really not reading those and it's just flooding inboxes.",
"Hi can I have an OPTION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE NEW AND OLD DESIGNS OF THE WIDGET? The previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks, while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width, which disables full reading of the task(bad). Also, subtasks cannot be seen WITHOUT CLICKING the main task, which kinda defeats the purpose(again) of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything. Thanks",
"I am a firm believer that task management tools have to fit in with one's personal style of thinking and checking off and organizing tasks. For me, I spent many weeks or months trying different tools and chose todoist. Been a while now, and it has made life so much simpler for me. The projects/labels/filters etc work perfectly for the way I organized things. The quality has been pretty good too.",
"Todoist has been my go-to app for keeping a track of my tasks. What makes it my favorite is the way you can just type ""buy bread tomorrow"" and it automatically sets the reminder for tomorrow, rather than you having to manually set the date. The only issue I have is that when my Samsung phone goes into power saver mode, and then comes out of it, the Todoist widget doesn't load. I thought it would be fixed with updates, but it's never resolved. Hence one less star.",
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.",
"This app was good to use for a while, but when it started to glitch on me, tech support was not helpful. They kept telling me they were working on the issue but never fixed it. The app was nice to use and helpful, but if it ever stops working customer service is no where to be found. It's not worth the money or the headache.",
"DO NOT BUY the premium if you need Alexa and/or Outlook to integrate like they falsely claim this ap does or you need any support from Todoist. Outlook integration has never been a synced integration, it only forwards tasks one-way & only works with limited Outlook paid platforms. They have Alexa issue notice seen only when you try to set it up, no warning before buying believing you can integrate both. No Support response yet. I want my money back. Such waste of hours. I feel scammed",
"Just one thing: The physics behind the functionality of grabing a task are inaccurate. Personally, it takes me several attempts to get a task in the right parent when there are multiple levels of tasks in my list. I think the horizontal placement should be more responsive and less delayed(ish) Thanks for the app which is great tho.",
Great app! perfect for work where I have a lot of moving parts. Without it I'd be scrambled. I'm able to sync this on my desktop and it integrates everything from my app seamlessly. Please consider adding a feature creating a separate area for work and personal task.,
One of the Todo apps I have used for the longest time without having made the attempt to try any other out there. After a few months of basic I upgraded to the Pro and I can say Worth the Money for sure. Syncs on all devices and as a great web interface too which make sure all my tasks and reminders and captured instantly. The Windows app is a bit faulty... But then I think Windows itself has some complaints most of the item. The web interface helps in those cases.,
"Amazing app for personal task management. Input is stupid easy, it can be accessed from any device, and the layout is extremely intuitive. I've used this app for years, and have even tried to migrate to other apps only to keep coming back.",
"Almost everything great. Sugestion: when I edit a subtask and I click ""done"" the app sends me back to the board or ""project"" screen, is better if after clicking ""done"" we could go back to the task screen because sometimes I have to edit many tasks within a project and is annoying that it kicks me out every time. In android",
"I tried a bunch of the other top todo apps and like this the best. The simplicity of creating tasks and tagging tasks in natural language is great, as well as the ability to deeply customize your taxonomy with labels and sub projects. I'd probably rate it 5 if the note taking experience was better. ""notes"" are just ""comments"", and look terrible outside of mobile. They're given tiny real estate on web UI. Feel like it be better if projects/tasks had a dedicated ""summary"" field.",
"I've been using this app for like 2 years for personal use, haven't tried the premium business looking version. 🤔 it has been very useful,for my day to day and longer projects. Totally recommend for 2 reason: 1) Constant updates and improvements 2) I'm quite sure this is the smoothest task manager across platforms available in the market. (from what I know)",
"I'm currently using todoist premium, and unfortunately it ain't worth it. There are lot of restrictions in free version i.e., a simple thing as reminder option (really? Any free app allows that function). Also, it doesn't have any proper calendar view like Google Calendar. The Date parsing and natural language works fine. Other than that, I didn't find anything worth buying premium and free version doesn't provide much functions. There are other apps like TickTick that's same but better. 👍🏼",
"I tried multiple list/schedule apps this week, this one (fingers crossed) is working out great. I am using the free version for 3 days so far, easy to understand and if confused, many little videos to show the different features. I also have fallen in love with the complete for the day, I battle with depression so keeping lists helps me know I am accomplishing things but this app goes above my expectations with the graph showing how you are doing, thank you programmers",
"A wonderful app, for me it lacks only one, but importthing: a recurring task counter. I remember writing an email to you like 4-6 years ago about it, still not that much progress in this regard:) Sometimes i want to complete a task after 50 repetitions, not up to a certain date. Can't do it on Todoist though. Also would love to know how many times I've completed a certain recurring task, can't do this either:( i am considering switching but all the other stuff is so good I am still in doubt.",
This app is so amazing for planning! But it would be even better if we could color code and add a bigger calender for our tasks/projects! That way we can have a much better oversight of everything that needs to be done and what is what depending on the colors. I still highly recommended this app for those who are constantly busy! The developers did a wonderful job with this.,
"I give it 3 stars as the design looks good and the customization is also good. It allows you to create project, and add sections to avery project then add tasks. It lets you set a dat/timeline but the free version wont even allow you a single reminder. That seems like a very basic function to have in a Todo List/planing app, so not being able to use it at all without paying (meaning I couldn't test the basic function of the app for me) was what made me uninstall it.",
"12/1/20 edit: All of my previous grievances have been corrected and improved upon including being able to add new tasks with due dates in the widget and having them auto-sort. Props on the improvements, keep up the good work :) March review: New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.",
"Huge pain to delete. I immediately realized I would not use this app, and tried to delete. It took forever to find out how, and then I was told I needed to set a new password to delete everything. I did that, and then it gave me a random error saying to try again later. Very frustrating for something I literally do not even want to be interacting with anymore!!",
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.",
"The app works just fine and helped me a lot. But recently the widget has been creating problems. It refuses to show me my tasks on the widget. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this is the third time. I hope it is fixed, if on my end then be it that but I really don't want to move in from this app.",
"Overall it's a great tool that has helped me better organize my projets and plan ahead, and not forget tasks anymore. The only critic I would have concerns the reminders : I don't understand why it is not possible to simply select a time and date, rather than writing the reminder. It feels more tedious to write ""next Tuesday at 9 AM"" rather than simply selecting it.",
"I find the app very intuitive and robust for my needs. I love the various thoughtful integrations (i.e., Outlook and with my Google Assistant). My one minor complaint is the frequency of updates to the app and desktop version. I've worked with software developers before and standard practice is to bundle updates together in less frequent releases. Here, it is not unusual to have several updates per month.",
"Just getting started and this isn't very intuitive and I can find no where to set up recurring tasks. This looks like it's just a copy of Planner from Teams. Not a good model to copy. Edit from dev feedback: Based purely on how bad an idea that recurring tasks would be set by the task name is, I'm deleting the app. 🙄👎",
"This is a marvelous app, trust me I have installed almost every app, nothing comes near to this. One of its kind. Now that being said I would like to give some improvement suggestions. Please add separate notification for separate task, make them ""sticky"" so that someone can't just push it away and add ""completed"" or ""later"" buttons on the notification so that one can update tasks without opening the app. And please don't make it a premium feature. Thank you.",
"I'm doing what I decry - leaving a bad review even though I didn't try the product. I just want to say I don't mind paying for an app if it's worth it. Developers should get paid for good work. This one, however, requires a subscription. I had to install it and create an account before I could find out the upgrade cost. The cost isn't terrible for a good app, but I'm not buying another subscription for for another thing. I'm really getting tired of everything requiring subscriptions.",
"Holy cannoli I freaking LOVE this app! There are so many features and tools to get me organized!!!!! I do have the premium version which has already paid for itself in value. I've been watching how to videos to get more familiar with the app, without watching them I would say there is a bit of a learning curve. This app will be used more than any other app on my device. I love that you can use it on phone and computer. I did a lot of research before choosing a to do list app and it paid off!",
"Quite a helpful app. I rate based on my overall experience of Todoist. I give 4 stars since I've come across misc bugs, mostly in the web app...the Android version has never bugged on me actually. the web/desktop app bugs are usually very small and usability impact is quite small. the todoist team is responsive to bug reports but when I see bugs I don't report, they seem to linger for quite a while",
"It is an amazing app. Helps you list down task, prioritise it and schedule reminders for the same. The themes to have multiple options to choose from. The only issue I face sometimes is that I can't check off a task from the widget list created on my home screen. That is the only reason for the 4 star review.",
I find the app super useful. I have a young baby so I will think of things I need to do but then have to change a nappy etc. and I forget. I now just bang it into the app and do it when I can. I feel like there could be more features like the ability to add lists to tasks. It may be there are more features if I pay.,
"I've been using todoist for years and it's gone from strength to strength. This app runs my life and I wouldn't have it any other way. Whether complex project management, medication reminders, payment schedules or shopping lists everything is simple to structure in an intuitive way that has kept me organised and on task.",
"I'm increasing my review to 4 stars after experiencing a very frustrating issue with the app and widget in the last 2 weeks. It seems to be fixed and actually functioning better than before in the last few days. As long as it stays this way and doesn't have further issues, I can strongly recommend Todoist, and I'm glad I don't have to find a new app.",
This app is fantastic!!! I have anf will continue to recommend this to anyone eho is trying tobetter prioritize and organize their lives. I especially like using this for my college courses. I love being able to get the full course syllabus in ahead of time to organize and keep up with everything else in life as well.,
"Some issues with the widget in Android, the rest is perfect. The app is minimal and has perfect functions. Best part about it is *no ads*. Please do check why the widget isn't functional in android phones without the app itself being open in the multitask pane. That is the only issue, rest is perfect. The widget isn't clickable or accessible unless the app itself is open in the task pane.",
"Task sections with a ""/” in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",
"App generally works, but it's impossible to include any time or date information in a task name, which is incredibly frustrating. For example, if you want a task that says 'tell family I need the car tomorrow', you're out of luck because 'tomorrow' is not allowed. You can't 'prepare for meeting at 12' either, or any such thing. Very annoying system.",
"The app itself is very good, and doesn't require Premium to actually be your daily task manager. It is great to see developer providing for desktop/iOS too, and all for free. The aforementioned calendar integration should be done through the web page or desktop (not the mobile app). It works just as advertised, but instead of a ""timeline"" with tasks it's the tasks window with calendar events/tasks. So, works really well, just maybe isn't for me. An exemplary simple app.",
"I love the depth of customization in this app! I can do so much in it! I love it so much! Thank you for creating this. I only have one suggestion and that is to view completed task in each labels/filters in that day, week, or month. The current completed tasks shows it each day and it can be messy. It would be lovely to see them categorized. For example, the label is ""gratitude"" it would be nice to see the achieved tasks there which indirectly tells me to be grateful for.",
"I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!",
"I love this app ❤️, this makes my day exciting, the satisfaction of marking done on the app after completing a task is on next level. The UI and everything is so good in this app. I reduced one point because there are no many options to snooze tasks when they pop in the notification area, rather here in this app we need to pick one snooze time from the settings and it sticks with all the tasks. To the Developer: Please fix this by giving multiple snooze options directly in the notification area.",
"Simple to use but superior functionality & UI - best app for staying organized across all devices. Unbeatable for getting things done at the right time, especially when used with Pomodone app. Anyone who doesn't pay the small annual subscription isn't serious about their own success, and is unappreciative of what the Todoist team have achieved. Support these people!",
"This app is as useless as Google Tasks which doesn't send any notifications to remind me of the tasks it asks me to pay for it to send notifications, useless.",
"I liked the simplicity of this app. It does lists with tasks and sub-tasks with our without due dates and that's all I really want it to do. It doesn't try and complicate things, it syncs simply with my PC and laptop and doesn't bother me with annoying notifications.",
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.",
"The sub tasks are really a great help in organizing thoughts and tasks. I also love the Projects section! It gives me the freedom to just dump all the stuff in my head, allowing me to have a space for other stuff to think about. My mindspace is feeling a lot freer than ever before, the simple reminder apps just don't work for me. I like the Karma feature too!",
"So far so good. Looks good, easy to use. I am still learning and haven't worked out how to set up templates. Great reminders to email - which is very useful. Love how I can reschedule to the next day if I havent completed the daily todoist list. Notes section on daily task is very useful.",
This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.,
"The app is too complicated and has too many features that are not intuitive or user-friendly,too expensive and requires a premium subscription to access most features1too buggy and has sync issues, data loss, crashes, and glitches,The app is too restrictive and does not allow users to customize their tasks, projects, or labelsThe app is too slow and consumes a lot of battery and memory",
"I like it.its simple and has most features i use daily such as boards which are buggy tho. Id really like a separate calander feature to assign each todo to a certain time with different views of either day, week, month. Would be useful to know when to do this task since the current schedule feature is uncomfortable to use. A note taking feature would be a life saver tbh and adjusting the width of sections in board view would be cool. Customizable priorities would make things easier.",
"Update: As a big user of sub-projects, I was disappointed to see their usefulness go when they no longer appeared in the main project. However, I have recently been pleased to notice the new ""Sections"" feature now allows me to replicate that functionality, and being able to display them a board is a nice touch. I also appreciate how the functionality of the Wear OS app has come along when other developers have been dropping watch support.",
"Well, i thought it's the best in the market as they clearly have 13yrs of experience now but i was wrong. I so wanted to avoid that (Ticktick) app but there's no alternate to it. Pros - Amazing sync & interface Cons - pricy, no calendar view or sync available within the app (like ticktick), no habit tracker.",
"I read that users complain that the functions are too limited in the free version. I used the free version only so far and i can't complain. Adding notes, links and labels is sth that works only in the premium version (and would be nice to have) but the free version is fully functional. i enjoy it a lot!",
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.",
Downloaded today and the app generates an error when I try to create an account. Not a great sign!,
"I've looked hard at many to-do apps and Google Tasks & Reminders. I think Todoist is the best of them all, and easily worth the small subscription fee. Custom filters and the Android home screen widget are a great combination. I do wish for a minor UI fix for the widget, but no other to-do app comes close!",
"todoist is the best I've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later, while syncing with Google calendar. Unfortunately, it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries, especially those that repeat -don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event!",
"Usually this is a great tool. The widget is very well designed and helps me stay organized. Unfortunately, the software has been crashing since the most recent update. This makes rearranging and organizing my day very difficult. I use a Motorola, so it may just be an issue with my type of phone.",
"Completely spamming my calendar with recurring tasks that I never created. Update: Yes I connected to my google calendar. Then your auto generated recurring tasks like ""review the day and plan ahead"" were filling every day of my calendar. It was a total mess. I had to carefully go over every task in todoist and had to remove the due date, then save, then delete the task. Because just deleting didnt work because they reapperad the next day. Now I deleted the integration which solved the issue.",
"This is the only app I use for my time and activities management because it does everything I want and need. For example, it's extremely important for me to be able to track my past appointments as well as accomplishments. Other apps I have used in the past did not keep such an easily retrievable archive. When you get to be my age, remembering past doctor and dentist appointments as well as recording important notes about them is invaluable. I gladly pay for the premium upgrade; well worth it!",
You need to purchase an upgrade for it to be at all useful.,
"Love the smart interpretation of list items, correctly identified dates, repeats, etc. Available on multiple platforms. No annoying adds or push to premium subscription. Integration with Google calendar is really useful. Better suited to tasks tracking than groceries lists, I would say. Easily recommended.",
"Constant bugs - breaks functionality or UX that worked previously. For example, reordering tasks flickers for a second while it's updated to and from the server. Last update for disabling reordering of tasks while they're ordered by priority made the app unusable for me. Almost every time everyone adds the tasks of urgent priority (don't we? ;)) And it's very hard to order it to be in the top in case you have like 50 tasks in the list...",
"Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone",
"I generally love this app. It's quick and easy to use. Looks good too. I just wish you could make the widget smaller. I'd like to have two widgets next to each other, one for today and one inbox (I know you can switch what you see, but I forget that and would love to be able to have a widget for each without having to take up more than half of my screen). I would also love if Google calendar could be seen in todoist too & not just todoist in Google calendar.",
"Can't share in typical fashion. Can't easily flip through attachments. 1. No share menu option on item-level. Android design pattern users expect ""Share"" item. Share to Google Photos' Share button great example. App MixNote's great Share example: popup ""Share by text"" or ""Share by picture"". Your ""Add reaction, Copy, Edit, Delete"" isn't cutting it. 2. Attachments, ugh. Can't just swipe through item attachments. Have to back out of view, select next photo to view. Yuck. MixNote does right, IMO.",
Integration with Google assistant is pathetically bad even when it works. It stopped working completely after a couple of kludgy weeks. Customer service never figured out the problem and I stopped using todoist in favor of anylist which integrates seamlessly with assistant. Prepaid todoist annual plan and basically never used it.,
"Great experience so far. Only wish that the subtasks remain in the main task and does not show up in all task list with no due date. And a calander view would be nice. Shifted fr Ticktick to this one, and working out fine so far. However my really important notes (comments) suddenly disappeared. This I'm quitting the app. This is really critical and disappointing",
"It was working before and now things have moved around and I have to figure out how to use the app again... Productivity apps aren't supposed to slow you down! I preferred the hamburger menu being a swipe in from the left, it didn't take up space at the bottom of the screen before. Also had to uninstall and reinstall because GCal sync wasn't working and the whole app just showed a spinning circle.",
"I LOVE the new widget! It's finally useful! Please let us change the time when the day changes... For example, I go to bed at around 3AM. I consider any time before that to still be the technically previous day. That completely messes up tasks that repeat after completion...",
"Enjoying this app so far, it offers more sorting and organization options and easier due date editing than Google Tasks, which is what I used before. I like how seamless it is to move items to different projects and dates. However, I wish there were more options to see my completed tasks, though: at least an option to show the tasks I completed this week or today... It means a lot to me able to see my completed tasks (I like to SEE my productivity without having to dig for it).",
"great tool to track my tasks and activities. I can read from any place my tasks and they are synchronized even with my outlook. Private or business tasks are so easy to track. I tried different apps before, but really, there is nothing that is better than Todoist. This app has a lot of features and it continues to be improved. 👍 Good job to all the team and developers!",
I have to say that I completely love this task manager app (it's a winner above all the others that I tried mainly because you can set subtasks and sub-subtasks almost indefinitely). I have an idea of a feature that could make it even better (nothing groundbreaking though. I would like to be able to set percentual progress in any given task based on my own subjective estimation (so basically I could decide to make the progress on a task 50% or 20%). Keep up the good work,
"Been using this app for long time now. Almost bought the premium version twice :P but the cost is too high. Great UI feels great to use the app. By far the only app which has solved recurring tasks use cases properly (beats Google Tasks). Only complaint is in ""Today"", when I have overdue, I would like to have an option to either see today first or overdue first. I always get overdue first, it made sense previously, but now that i have a lot of overdue, i dont want to miss out on today's tasks, its like paying penalty twice (paid once for having the task in overdue and missing out on my today's tasks). Reminders should have been in free version (this has caused me to look for other apps and will slowly deprecate this app on my phone). Overall a great app. Kudos to the team.",
"Downloaded this app in the year of 2020 and I gotta say, this app is exceptional when it comes to jotting down tasks, planning events, and creating projects for bussinesses. Never in my life have I seen such brillance in design and organization, all in one tiny icon! Keep up the good work, developers of this amazing app!",
definitely keeps me on top of my tasks and helps me feel as if I'm being productive. the way you can categorize and prioritize tasks according to your goals and projects definitely helps me stay on track and focus on what I want to focus on at certain times. the only con is that the constant updates makes it hard to keep up with how the interface works and I'm constantly having to learn where things have been moved to.,
"Literally just started using this app and really like it so far, it's pretty easy to use, but I wish there were more options for making tasks due. Specifically, being able to make something due ""every 2 days"" or ""once a week"" without having to pick a particular day would be *very* helpful.",
Push notifications don't work on my phone at all. What's the point of having a to-do list app if it doesn't send notifications when something is due? Permissions have been granted. My phone is not on battery saver or do not disturb mode. Notifications simply don't work.,
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it.",
"I really like the structure of the app. I was looking for something that would reinforce deadlines and having the widget on my homescreen, and the fact that it doesnt get rid of overdue assignments helps me so much. Edit: the suggestion helped! Thank you!! [the widget didn't update the day / what is due today unless I open the app or the widget settings]",
"So I have been hoping around in the Todolist apps for a while now, and I think I might have a winner, Todoist is a clean and simple app to use, I like the fact that it can go in the notification shade, makes it much easier to set reminders and tasks for yourself! Thank you for a great Todolist experience!!!",
"For me the widget is the biggest strength. You can custom it to blend with the background. You can see your upcoming week easily (+ today) . You can create a task in one tap and add a date just by mentioning it (ex: tomorrow, in 3 days, every Sunday at 2pm etc). Everything is fast, simple, clear. And you can also add text and images to a task.",
"Todoist has been a big help for me getting organized and I love using it. Unfortunately I can only give it three starts due to a problem I've been having for months now. Long story short, my weekly streak doesn't reset when I fail to meet my weekly goal. I've contacted their customer support team twice since the problem started and both times I was told they were checking with the dev team followed by silence. No explanation or solution.",
"I love this app, *but* with the disclaimer that I don't like how it syncs with google calendar. When I synced it, ALL of my todoist entries showed up as calendar events, making it impossible to use my calendar. And, I couldn't un-sync it. So I ended up having to completely delete that todoist account and make a new one with a different email. That was some time ago (two years?) So it's possible the sync function is improved.",
"Not able to witness due date for repeat tasks in the latest update. I use the app on my iPad and my Android phone and didn't face any such issues until the latest update. Given that I use a daily checklist, the dates on each item are usually displayed below the task. I now have to manually click on each task in the Android app to see if I'd checked them off. Please fix this immediately.",
"They improved the App on PC since last time I tried it (like 4 years ago or something) and I can say I'm glad I downloaded it back. Free Version is good if you don't need to track many projects, and the subscribtion is a fair price that I might pay in the future if I need it. Highly recommended",
"Great app, very helpful for me. I have a very mentally demanading job and have to keep alot of tasks organized. Todoist help me keep everything in order so I dont forget anything. However, I'm using it on my Samsung Note 10 plus. I've done some research and I'm being told that android will not sync to the Google calendar. I just have the free app on my phone, and know I can still use it with the dex, but if there is a way I can sync it to Google calendar please let me know.",
"It is a lot of fun. I used to use the memo's app that came with my phone but that took a lot of designing. I liked it because it was digital and I could easily erase it. This has a comments section, cute icons, you can set dates and times and get email updates on your projects. You can also create projects and color code. I am getting so much accomplished with this app. I absolutely love it!!!",
"App is really good; very helpful for listing my recurring and non recurring tasks. But looks like an ordinary task when being made a recurring one, the key words dont work. Also, request you to bring in more motivational cues like stickers or display points achieves on a daily basis.",
Terrific! Couple of things: 1. If your choice is to sort your list by Date - it should do this automatically when adding a task (instead of having to select Sort -> Date each time). 2. For the Widget it would be nice if you could have a little coloured circlet/dot next to the Project name (as it shown within the app itself).,
"This app is absolutely amazing. I'm a STEM college student at UC Santa Barbara, so I have a lot of homework, studying, and places to go in a day and I've been looking for a good to do list app for a while and this hit the jackpot! Even without the premium you can label your list and that is extremely helpful. I highly recommend this app if you need to sort out things in your day :)",
"Great app ,it just worked very well for my personal needs, even in the Free plan, Great work 😍❤️ Edit: There is one issue, the reminder is not in the free plan and I think this is a must have feature in to-do list app so please consider this. Edit2: I was able to fix the reminders issue by linking my account with Google Calendar, and then using Google Calendar reminders for free. so for me now the app is really great even in the free plan.",
"Commit to it. It is amazing. I don't know all of its uses but it works for me and easy, quick, and smooth.",
"This app has been great for synchronising our chores and lists in the family, but wince several updates ago the process of completing checklists is completely unusable. The app re-renders several times every time you mark an item as completed. We have been unable to use it since, as it's way too slow.",
"This app has a cookie-cutter UI so it at least looks nice, but they put the same amount of effort into the app's functionality. They even cover some buttons with popups that you can't dismiss. I can't believe I paid $36 for this. The reminders feature is cuttered and they clearly put very little thought into UX. I just want a refund.",
"Wunderlist was Waaay better. Too bad that one got bought out. I need an app that syncs to another phone, and that let's me organize things the way I need them. This app is okay, but they reserve a lot of features for the paid version (subscription required). Not gonna happen. I've used this app for several months, but I'm done.",
Todoist really arranges my life for now and the fact the basics are free is what made me rate it in the first place. This is absolutely gorgeous and I really like the facts the premium stuff is extra additions to the free basic needs which allows broke people to still use it and be satisfied. I think that I will upgrade to premium at some point because of the good quality app and the fact that the basics are completely free. Not all companies do that; I would rate it 10 stars if I can.,
"I love todoist.... I have stuck with this software longer than its competitors. I gave it 4 stars because I want more themes( nature, full dark mode themes, more colors like even soft pinks, lavender, powder blue) I would love an alarm on my tasks because reminders just dont catch my attention. I would love to be able to make list with checkboxes or numbers in comments on a task. I wish this app had a timer on each task as well. I love this app.",
"This app has completely changed my life. I want to thank everyone who is somehow connect with To-Do List. It works like a game and seeing your progress makes you work even harder)) Besides, it doesn't take as much time (and paper, which is also important) as a bullet journal, so it's easier to stick to this and make the app a part of your routine.",
"Widget options are very minimal. Doesn't allow pulling in calendar events, so you'll still need to manage those obligations in another app. Subtasks on recurring tasks behave in a disconnected way in that you have to set up their recurrence separately and it can easily get out of sync. Date/recurrence input is unintuitive.",
"As of version 8602, all the issues I was having with crashes, duplicating items, and the Add Task button in sectioned lists have been resolved. App works great now. Not a huge fan of the bar on the bottom instead of top, but it's not a big enough issue to knock a star off.",
"The latest update adds an extra step to switching to a filter. Normally clicking deeper into more menus is only mildly inconvenient, but after 2 years, there is still no real kanban view. I need a todo app that saves time, not becomes a time consuming activity in itself.",
"EDIT: Changing to 5 stars, turns out you can set up gCalendar sync, you just have to do it via the web client. Original review: brilliant app, very customizable and also can be synced with other devices and has a browser extension. my only gripe is that it desperately needs calendar integration so you could sync events with your Google calendar. besides that, amazing app.",
"An awesome app with lots of integrations. The only feature I'm missing is the ability to set a permanent order (when I have the tasks sorted and then add another one, it ends up on the bottom and I have to press the sort button again)",
"I'll always miss Wunderlist, but I'm very grateful that I found Todoist! 👌 My only problem is that I keep exiting the app when I try to go ""back"" a page after entering a task. Am I missing something, or do I have to get used to it? 🥴 Reply to developer:Thanks for responding! I usually hit the home button to leave, but when I want to truly kill/exit other apps, I go ""back"" from the *main* page. I see the page that lists all projects as main. It's the top of the tree & has the settings gear.",
Such an easy to use yet effective app! I've burnrd through so many organisers and planners over the years but have finally found something that works for me! The free version gives you everthting you need to get started and I've been making progress on personal projects like never before! Helps you set realistic goals and not to try to achieve too much in one sitting. Would recommend!,
"I'm pretty sure I have two accounts, one through apple and one through google play. i tried to follow the instructions to deactivate one and I'm missing the button that's described in the how-to. I've reached out for help with no avail. I'll probably cancel both accounts. Two starts for lousy customer support on a decent product. UPDATE TO ONE STAR FOR NO REFUND UPON CANCELING.",
"Buggy, unusable, lost all my work. On each run it showed me a different list, even duplicated stuff. When I deleted a list it duplicated, it also deleted the other one, which made me lose a lot of time. Learn to code!",
"It's an effective Todo list manager, but for some reason the widget won't display anything, just an empty list. This has been a common issue with most Todo list widgets I've tried, though. So the problem is most likely with the phone. Any insight would be appreciated",
"I love this app and use it mainly for a to-do list/remember this list. The only problem that I have experienced is, it's quite sensitive. When I mistakenly touch something and it deletes, it is gone. Sometimes it happened so quickly I don't even know what I just deleted. I wish there was a ""deleted files box"" that it went to so that I could restore that which I mistakenly deleted, which could be emptied later at my decision. Other than that, it is a wonderful program and I do recommend it.",
"it's an app that allows me to make a task repeat itself without paying up, that's already a bonus.",
"I am extremeky disappointed with this app.  I lost a lot of information with the last upgrade.  Now, i am wasting time constantly updating this app.  I am currently looking at other applications.  If your improvements risk functionality,  it is not worth it.  It makes me believe that your designers and programmers do not actually use the app. I use the app for health issues like medicine times.  Could have been very detrimental.",
"What is point of giving the trial if you can not try the most basic features! If users schedule a task and leave the app, they will not even get the notification of the due task. User can only unlock this by having pro version of the app. One more thing for the UX team, there is just a single difference between a reminder and a notification (alert). And this app not even give you a alert in the trial version.",
"The interface for rescheduling tasks is terrible and the signup process is so frictionless that it's actually not very secure (easy to create fraudulent accounts under someone else's email). That said, the app is very good at what it does, which is organizing your tasks, projects, and lists.",
"I've tried several organization apps. Most of them were fine, but they would always be missing a feature I needed when something came up and would get me off track. Todoist is so versatile with its features that I can figure out how to put these situations into my schedule without changing the whole system. Keep it up!",
It's really awesome for organizing and scheduling things! I loooove it! Also it lets you plan stuff daily weekly monthly are even yearly. Really awesome. The only thing that is lacking is a weekly calendar viewing or something to keep your week more organized and have a better arregement if your tasks. There is that last star.,
"I wanted the ability to create project, and categorized to-do lists, and this app works perfectly. I really like the home screen widget, and when I've had questions about how to use certain features (i.e. setting a recurring task) a quick Google turns up helpful results.",
"It is an extraordinarily designed app. However the subscription price is high. Please reduce the price so that more & more people can enroll Please add the option to have ""end time"" for each task, I mean the ""From"" and ""To"" time for each task. Also the unfinished tasks of ""Yesterday"" can automatically come to ""Today"" since tasks showing in yesterday's list does not make sense. Reducing one star for this. Once these changes are done, I will surely re-rate as 5 stars. Thanks..You guys Rock!!",
"Best part is: It understands pseudo language and we can easily manage our todos through drag-drop, labels, priorities, project, auto and custom reminders etc...  Everything seems perfect and very easy except few things:  It lacks time tracking, motivation, easy individual todo and project progress, AI to schedule the day according to our todos.  It offers various time tracking integrations but none of them support other platform than web and even if some integration would support mobile platform, we will have to keep multiple apps for single purpose!  Looking forward to see time tracking and progress for both individual and group todos!  Kudos to Team!  Best Regards, Sagar",
"Was pleasantly surprised with nice UI and ability to add and organize tasks. Got everything moved over from G Tasks and set to use Todoist. That was until I was waiting for a reminder to notify me a task is due. A notification of a task due is an integral part of task management. Unfortunately you must purchase the premium version for this to work, which in my opinion makes this app completely unusable.",
"Badly needs an alarm as a notification option. I keep missing tasks with the current status bar notifications all the time. For such a well designed app, I find the exclusion of such a simple feature surprising. Other apps have it, and it's almost making me consider leaving Todoist for them.",
"Please revert to your old version & interface! The new widget has made the app completely unusable. It used to be my favorite task management app and now I'm searching for alternatives, on the verge of uninstalling it! P.S. Please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself, when you add a new task. I have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date.",
"This app has replaced my chaotic stream of notebooks, carted around in my various bags until their covers fall off and I no longer know where to find anything. I upgraded to the premium version after using the trial month and never regret it. In addition to syncing with my GCal, I have the tab pinned in my browser so I can organize and share notes across my phone and computer with ease. At the day job we use Asana, but Todoist is my choice for both personal projects/hobbies and freelance work.",
It's great! Honestly the best project management tool that I've been lucky enough to find. That being said I do have one gripe. I can not for the life of me figure out where an up to date list of free and premium features are. It says that 80 projects are supported in free(total overkill but hey) I got stopped at five. How many are in premium? Does the alert work in premium? Gcal sync by labels? Edit: good info in reply. Upped stars to 5/5 from 4. Rest of review unchanged.,
"One of the best personal or business task management apps for mobile or desktop use. Paid version is inexpensive for the value. Extensive integrations through such platforms as IFTTT. Very versatile. Very easy to use. While I regularly evaluate most others on the market, this is among the top five. And for the last 4 months, it's my go-to app for personal and various small businesses with up to five other collaborators. A simple calendar within the app is the only feature missing.",
"Subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous. I was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app, but having to pay nearly $5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd. Once I saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall, I had to stop using it",
"Whenever the app get cleared out of the RAM and I try to open it, it just crashes and then works fine. Also I wish reminders was a thing for free users as well. To get access to that one feature (Atleast that's what I'll use) paying for such a heavy subscription just doesn't make sense to me. Great tasks app otherwise",
"Good app, could be truly great if one more thing was baked in. Imagine if there was a difference between true due dates for tasks and planned dates for finishing them by. I'm envisioning features similar to Trello where you can drag and drop tasks with due dates onto a planning board calendar. This would be excellent for any college students with hectic assignment and exam schedules, or those simply trying to get ahead in their work.",
"It's so confusing. Why does my keyboard stay up so randomly when adding a task? On some forms you can't hide it, on others you can but it's shown by default even when no text field accepts input. And why can't I choose a period for a task and instead I have to type it? The app really lacks integrity.",
"Thank you for adding the ability to make strikethoughs on mobile via markdown. Much appreciated! 💜 But, after the newest task view update, everything is just too big/overwhelming for me. I like things more compact(?) sometimes, and the layout before the update was perfect for my needs. Maybe a Settings feature for those who worked best w/ older, less ""streamlined"" Todoist layouts to switch between (or alt. layout modes—think a ""compact mode"" like how Discord & Gmail do it) would be best? 😢",
"This handled tasks exactly as expected. Due dates sort into categories, with overdue tasks exposed as well (a simple thing that Microsoft To Do continues to botch). The best replacement for Wunderlist, even if you have to pay for access to simple things like comments and reminders (worth $5/yr at most, but I'll pay the extra to avoid the UX issues in other apps... for now)",
"It's excellent except for a really significant flaw. The option to complete recurrent tasks infinitely and not be able to reset them is frankly a terrible, terrible idea. I now have 50 tasks completed in the first day! Accidentally. Please, please, please fix it, I beg you",
"It is the only app I have found that integrates 2way with Google calendar. With this, tasks can show up as events in my calendar and I can edit them in both apps. Apart from that, it has many great useful features that I regularly use, such as: categorizing tasks (project level as well as section level), prioritizing tasks, sub tasks, comments within tasks. A minor complain would be that you can't move around multiple tasks at once and that there is no native Linux app.",
"I don't write reviews. However, when Todoist, my most used App prompted me for the first time to rate them, how could I say no? This app has basically changed my life, giving me an outlet to bettet manage my schedule and my time in a simple, yet effective manner. Personally, I do not use the more complex tools like ""Projects"" but, even for the free users (I'm one) this is a wondeful tool. My favorite feature is the ability to flag different priority levels for different assignments.",
"One of the best Todo list app on the play Store. I use it daily for my School, work, appointments and personal tasks. It works perfectly no bugs disturbing ads, the app is easy to use even if you are a beginner. What I wish to see is a better ui design that makes the app not great but perfect the app does look a little bit old so a new theme would be amazing and I would really love to see an option to sync the Samsung Calender with this app. Spacial Thanks for the developer and the whole Team.",
pretty good if you can do all the things you put on it,
It's a good app but ever since yesterday the app will open but kicks me out.,
"I love this app! I can't believe how powerful it is. A little learning curve, but after that, it's also quite easy to use. Suggestion: certain tasks I want to do every day, but they're not important. I would love a separate widget for repeating tasks without seeing them on my daily (and not seeing the ones due tomorrow in project view) ya know? P.s. as someone with severe adhd, highly recommend, esp if you like Routinery",
"I had been using tasks in Microsoft Outlook, as well as in my case management software. But found them not very effective in helping me achieve task completion. Then I was recommended Todoist. Todoist has been a game changer. It has a unique approach to task creation, follow-up and completion, that is effective and motivates one to actually get the task done. I also love the fact that it focuses on one thing and 1 thing only: tasking. And by doing so it is extremely effective at it.",
"I like this app, it has helped me organize my day",
"The best project management app I've ever used! I have used many different apps and methods to help organize my life. But when I found ToDoist, it had everything I needed and then some. Their help articles and support are the best so it's easy to get started; and they are constantly coming up with new features to make the app better. The free version has all the necessary features for the average user and the premium version is cheap compared to other project management apps. I highly recommend.",
"LOVE IT. as someone who is all about organising things and checklists, this app is really the best thing for productivity. And most of all, my mental health. :) And it's so intuitive, very easy to use and sort things out - and design of it all, is also another favourite thing of mine.",
A basic feature like reminders is paid.,
"Great app, gets the job done and helps organize assignments, only thing that I would like would be if the widget had rounded corners and maybe have an option for a sort of blur background to make the widget look more modern and appealing. Everything works perfectly, definitely recommend.",
"Kept getting ""an unknown error has occurred, please try again later"" .... Tried on several devices on my T3 connection, had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one. Uninstalled. Sad cuz it looked great. In re: dev's reply, yes I did that. I made sure it was plugged in and turned on too. I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks.",
"Im a notorious list jumper (always trying to find the best app for managing my to dos) and ive been using todoist for over 2 years. The only downside for me is a lack of dependent tasks and id really like to see it incorporated in the future, along with ""hide until"" or "" start dates"" both available in other apps and would increase the clean interface for those that care to use them. despite that, still the best app out there. Kudos as well for keeping accessibility in mind during development",
"App is quite good overall and I use it everyday. Reminders shouldn't be a pro feature, but I guess they have to make money. Biggest issue is general bugginess. Latest update means I can't add tasks to any section in sectioned view. ""Add task"" button does nothing. The only way to add a task is the hold and drag the ""add task"" button into the list above, then you can add a new task. Very buggy though, please fix.",
"This is a great app, and I love it, bit I have two small issues with it. First, I don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks. Second, I wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in. Since fixing one would fix both, this is still a great app",
"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?",
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list....",
"Great app, very mature and scalable. You can use it any way, as simple it as complex as you need to, any type of custom workflow can be built via Todoist. I've came from Evernote in August 2022, and instantly realized what I've been missing in terms of tasks functionality. I subscribed to premium plan on day 1.",
"This app has been life changing. I'm more productive than I've ever been, and feel less stressed and on top of things. The app is reasonably intuitive, and I picked it up really quickly. I'm considering springing for the premium features as a lot is locked out in the free version, but I feel like it will be worth it.",
"I gave this app a 2nd try after it not working well for me the first time, and it's been awesome. I actually pay for the $2/month premium now so I can make more lists and projects since I use it so much now. I have ADHD, so organization and sticking with a system for longer than the initial ""new and shiny"" stage has been a big challenge--it still is, but using Todoist along with my paper planner has helped me be a more reliable human. Recommend giving it a try!",
"I've tried a dozen+ task list apps in the last few days (and many before that), looking for certain features. I don't know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it (no ""skip login"" option). Nowhere did I see the creators/reviews say an account is required even for starting/basic use. One star: non-web, non-collab, non-premium features should be accessible without account. Then I finally read 1- star reviews, now glad I didn't sign up: apparently the spam emails never cease.",
Really helps keep me accountable. Overall a great organizational tool. Better than calendars alone and other platforms like Trello or similar. Would be great if they had templates to choose from or tutorials on how to set up projects. Luckily I have PM experience and was able to map it out.,
"They have a premium version for $4 a month!!! REALLY?? Why don't you offer a FREE TRIAL?? Apps that have a ""Premium"" version you can't try until paying is shady and tells me, clearly hiding something. I'm guessing it's not worth price and you'll find that out with a trial, so they don't offer it. Uninstalling!! Way too many similar apps for free or cheaper paid version.",
"LOL greedy app devs. They charge $36 annually or $48 if you select the monthly option. If you get the premium version, it'll allow you to receive push-notifications for a scheduled task. Like, to set a timer / alert for something on your list. Uninstalled. For $40, the app better be making you breakfast in the morning.",
"This app (and Google add-on) is amazing, even the free version. However, the new widget is worse than the old one. One major reason I say that is because the old version allowed overdue tasks to be rescheduled with a single touch. In this new one, so far, you have to go back into the app.",
Once again you've made this worse by redesigning the widget. It was fine as it was. Now I can't select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item. If this carries on I'm definitely not renewing my subscription. Please restore,
I run multiple businesses and so far this has helped me organize my days tremendously. A lot of initial decisions had to be made about where I want things and that took a while but now I'm really glad I took the time to do it because it's all coming together and actually relieving some stress. Hopefully I can come back and add the 5th star after I've had more time using it!,
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it",
"I've been a Pro user for a while and Todoist is almost perfect for me as it's really fast and easy to add tasks and keep track of everything, however- the fact that I can't rearrange tasks in the Today tab as I wish is almost a deal-breaker to me. Some tasks may have time or priority set and I would still need to move something above them and I can't. The possibility of manual rearrange overwriting time and priority is necessary. I already sent a feedback and I hope you'll implement this",
"I don't always write reviews, but when I do, I really love the product. Todoist just send a newsletter that they providing amazing new features to the free version. I took the time to write what I love about their product on the survey, I thought it would be good to share it here as well but apparently 500 signs are the limit and I wrote.. A lot. So I will have it shortened. Todoist made my life a better one. 'It feels like I forgot something', well that's a thought of the past. Thanks guys!",
I am beginning to discover the power of this app. Keep finding hidden gems of good ways to organize and track what's important. Love the extensive integration. There's lots of good tips and examples which help immensely. I like the natural language scheduling feature. Easy to move things around to fit. Pretty awesome.,
"Love this app! It really helps me with the long list of things I have to do daily. It also has features that allow you to keep a certain task on loop which saves time. I love the little side projects that you can add on to help you keep track of things, it would be good to be able to write lists in those instead of just tasks to tick off.",
"3.5 stars out of 5. This is so far the better of the 5 to do list's I've tried. Make setting/linking tasks easier and more seamlessly synced with the rest of the list. Make it possible to like with my calendar and alert of of schedule conflicts, allow me to send task collaboration invites to others via text or email and be able to coordinate with other tourist users on joint tasks, finally a place holder for brainstormed tasks that I'll prioritize at a later date. This will make it a 5 star app",
"Only the best action tracking app ever. Simple and effective. The mobile version is great, and allows for on the go thought/action collection. I use this in conjunction with the web app on my laptop. The mobile and web app are both intuitive and stable.",
"Far too invasive in terms of notifications and company ads on your phone, and worse on the email address you register when creating a todoist account.. And that continues EVEN after uninstalling the app from my phone! Yes it's a multi device app but then one should have the option to uninstall your whole setup on all devices and your registration account Totally fed up from that from most of the apps you can install on your phone...",
"Life changer. Love being able to make nested subtasks and being able to assign dates to them! Web app, and windows app work incredible well and feel native. Great Google Assistant integration, but wish it was default for reminders which is probably something Google needs to do to support it. Only complaint is wish task descriptions were free but pricing plans are quite reasonable.",
"I didn't even get to use this app because ""reminders are a premium feature"". Anything to exploit money out of people. Basic functions of a planner shouldn't be a ""premium paid feature"". You want fancy backgrounds or other personalization? Charge for it. Special notification sounds? Charge for it. But a simple reminder (the whole point of a freaking planner) should be free.",
"Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.",
"I use this for GTD. On the premium version and I think the best benefit is file attachments, but the price still feels a bit high. Reminders being a premium feature is silly tho. My main gripe right is now is the difficulty in deleting completed tasks, you have to do them one at a time 🙃",
"It's free, and even without a paid subscription, you get a lot of helpful qualities, like easy organization and reminders to complete tasks or projects. The only reason I didn't give a fifth star is, you can't ask for reminders on certain days of the week, like every Tuesday and Thursday at noon or something. You can only do one day a week, or daily, or every other day reminders of tasks. Other than that, I would highly recommend it. I'm using it to organize my homework. 👍",
"It has a nice layout and I enjoy how you can separate tasks into projects and sub-tasks. My main gripe is that the task has to have a set date, instead of just 'x times a week'. And I can't make recurrent tasks, instead writing a new task when the other is finished.",
"App is great so far. Only used it for a little bit and I'm trying it imout but I'm very happy with how It understands language terms like ""clean dishes on Friday"" and it sets it for you on Friday and gives you a reminder that it's coming up. I noticed that when I tried to re-arange sub tasks in my boards it glitches and closes the app. Maybe this is something you guys can take a look into. It's not a huge deal for me. I still love the app so far.",
"EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS APP IS AWESOME! I love to be busy, and this app helps me so it. I love that it instantly syncs between my phone and my laptop, and it even had a browser extension. This Android app is fully featured with everything a good app should have; it's all implemented really well. Drag operations feel natural and the design looks good. I love the colors and the ability to color code my tasks/projects. This app was clearly built by passionate developers for engaged people!",
"I love this app, use it on a daily basis to keep track of everything and sync it with my calendar. For me a todo app like this is essential for getting things done, and I'm yet to find a better one than this. Premium version adds a lot of features, especially for business and collaboration, but you can easily get by with the free version. Highly recommend.",
"Very good, I've been using this app a long time to manage my tasks and keep track of lists. I have one issue with one of the recent update and that the change to the today widget. Previously was able to mark off tasks directly through the widget. Now if I click on a task it opens a little popup and then I can check off the task. The purpose of having the widget was to minimize the number steps. Why was this a decision made?",
"Love the lables(only on premium). Like that it works with Google assistant. Would like it if it integrated the functions of the Spen from note9... Be able to jot down nots and view them, as well as attachements, in the list instead of having to open up the list first.",
"I have tried many to do list apps out there, but this one seems to fit my needs, most of it anyways. The only gripe I have with this app is that it's not integrated properly with good assistant. So if I am busy or driving and want to add a task, I end up using Google reminder. But it could be Google's problem as well. All in all its good.",
"Using the free service: Nice simple app with easy sharing capabilities. I wish there was an easier way to umbrella small projects under large ones without having to share a whole bunch of individual projects. Not a perfect match for my needs, buy very adaptable.",
"I like how easy it is to use ToDoist. The UI is intuitive, options are lean, but useful, and this app encourages me to get things done. it would be nice to have a rich text editor for tasks, rather than one line, and other options to change the colors/font of the app. maybe those exist in the paid version?",
"The whole point of a to do list is to remind you to get things done with the help of a numeric badge count. Since they can't be bothered to add this feature, the app, is useless to me. You just loss a potential lifetime user who would have even paid a subscription to have that one feature. Other apps can offer badge counts through launchers such as Evie. Don't give me the excuse that Android is not developing this feature.",
The update makes no more crash,
"Thanks, all sorted and I'm able to see my lists again :)",
"This app has revamped my traditional to-do list approach. At first it may seem weird but once you get into it, it's great. I just wish that the desktop client would sync properly but other than that issue, the app is great for task management.",
"Great interface and perfect for everything! From school to personal things, this app is great to keep track of your tasks and projects. Also another great thing is that it let's you connect to your laptop and Google Cal, which is efficient 🙏😊 Try it out for yourself !",
"My favourite productivity tool ever. I've used it for all my task managing for years now. The app, browser and outlook plugins are all consistent and work perfectly. The support is easy to reach out to and quick to respond. Bought premium after a year of using it and never regretted.",
"I like this app. It is very easy to add new tasks with dates, projects, priority. I love also search, filters, possibility to move with tasks in the list, sharing and integration with Alexa. The best todo list app, which I have tried.",
"This app is really helpful, it helps me a lot in my studies. It gives me reminders to complete my left tasks. We can also set a time for a task as well as priorities for different tasks which is pretty satisfying. I haven't seen any faults so far in todoist.",
"Doesn't meet my needs. I'm looking for a to-do app that allows me to see the tasks on my smart watch, click them done, then restore the tasks. Wanting to create a task list that I'll do repeatedly. I do not want to have to touch my phone. This app doesn't perform in a manner that supports that.",
"If I remember correctly, I have been using todoist for over 5 years now. I really cannot imagine everyday life without it. I keep using the free version, as I find the pricing of the paid version too steep. Still, it does the job very well - if there was one app I'd take on a deserted island in shark infested waters, it'd be todoist. ;-)",
"Sync across devices is pretty much seamless. The interface is awesome. UX in general is very smooth and pleasant. The functionality is sufficient for me in terms of customizabiluty. On the other hand, I don't like some things. 1. Themes available for premium accounts are not outstanding. 2. You can't connect Google calendars from > 1 account. 3. Some of the functionality is only available in the web app. Also, integration with Jira would've been awesome (yes, it's a hint).",
"Nice app, great features, good design, however the pricepoint on the monthly fee is ridiculously high and is a must for core features that any to-do app must do, things like 'reminders' and 'labels'... Would try it out properly if the price was right (like 1/12th of what it is now?) but for now it's a pass.",
"NOT SAFE FOR BUSINESS: Hits maximum of 20 sections per project, even if some are deleted. When hit, nothing stops you from wasting hours of work that will ultimately disappear when you close the app because it's attached to an unsaved heading. This cost me money using it as a tool for brainstorming with a client. Todoist responded to this review before responding to my ticket (#680407). It's been over 2 weeks and there's been no news. Technical & customer support nightmare. There are better apps",
"Great app. Alas, I'm constantly reminded that ""Hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for : ) "". This is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense. Plus hey! Its expensive.",
"It is very easy to use, and it has all the tools I want to manage my tasks. The design is very sleek which I like. And I can even add it to my phone's home screen (Android) as a widget so I could check on my tasks easily everytime I open my phone. I am a very pleased user, thank you Todoist team.",
"Brilliant app. The main driving factor for me is its incredibly clean interface and just how intuitive it is. I've upgraded to the premium version, and I'll never look back. I use this everyday for just about everything, couldn't ask for a better productivity app!",
"This thing makes me productive by default. Its almost addicting. I wouldn't knock out a physical planner just yet. Todoist, from my understanding has only complented any type of schedueling sustem I had and made it more effective by allowing me to fill it up with things I need to get done and want to get done without any sort of complicated U.I. although. Dredful priorities are still dreadful regardless of what you write them on(paper, elctronic, etc..), todoist is definitely an ally.",
"This is fantastic, since i started using this app my life has changed dramatically: i quit drinking, my wife returned to me, even got a raise - the app is a blessing! I could only wish that it had an option for recurring projects, spending my - now amazing - life recomposing the same checklist every week, that's not right.",
"I am colour blind and dyslexic. Not able to read anything. I can't zoom in and I need to pay in order to see the colours better. [update] As I said, I would have to pay the app in order to have the right fonts and colour so I can actually read and make use with it. I've tried WeNote, and it's the app I need, without having to pay premium.",
"the only thing I don't like is all the goal-meeting stuff. but it can be ignored fairly easily. everything works great and is nicely customizable to make it pretty :) and so far, they haven't submitted to our Social Media Overlords, which is nice--no constant demands to share everything I do, say, or think! much appreciated.",
"The best out there, that too for free. I have a suggestion though, I know this app is free and I really like it, but if possible, including charts graphs and a timer option to monitor the time spent would literally blow the roof off. But excellent app anyways.",
"I saw this recommended and tried it. I really like the look of the app's widget. Some of the stuff is free and some is premium. I reviewed bout five task apps, and this came down to the finals but I don't want one of the features I need being behind a subscription. So I will be choosing something I can only pay once. Thanks for allowing trying this app!",
"I wish there was a way you could tell the app how much time is available for tasks in a day (changeable) and that the app. Would assign tasks according to priority given to tasks, allowing also for time assignment. Ie, task 1 has a high priority and takes 30 minutes. Oh and such a pity that you can't sync with your calendar on Android. However, very glad to have found this non linear planning tool.",
"I previously gave 5 stars. New feature forces 1 star. ""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" is TERRIBLE. please allow it as an option or revert! I set up all my stores (Costco, Walmart, etc.) now there is NO WAY TO LOOK AT MY ENTIRE SHOPING LIST!  I know I could drag sub tasks, but... 1. It's too easy to complete the parent task thus completing all child tasks. Not good...  2. Moving tasks from one parent task to another is also very dif",
"Love it. It's intuitive, simple, works and synchronizes across the platforms I use. On a more personal note, it helped me organize myself - I have ADHD and task management always have been a major issue for me. Other apps were too basic or too complicated",
"The Widget has problems I have faced for so long. First is the shortcut Todoist Icon on the widget does not work after a while and it is being consistent. I deleted App and Widget and try again but same problem. 2nd is the widget does not update to the task I put up. I have to manually go to the app and click on 'Inbox' then 'Today' again to get it updated den the same problem will start later on. Other than the widget problem, I love this App and have been using it for a long time now.",
This is a to-do list/reminders app and you have to subscribe to get reminders? Without subscribing you get no push notifications which defeats its purpose of being a to-do list/reminder app. Im immediately going back to TickTick. Their subscription based pro features are genuine for pro users and allow you to receive notifications for tasks.,
"Not a good first impression. Too easy to press a wrong fuction (e.g. check boxes) thinking it initiates a section when it clears the section instead (confetti streams down and section dissapears). No way to undelete. Also, when selecting any ""help"" or ""contact"" info, screen clears and shows, ""Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).""",
I really like this app. Getting to know all the little features that are included in the free version. It has helped me with my productivity as a sales professional and given me more control of task that need to be done daily to often get forgotten. I recommend this to anyone that find using a to do list helpful.,
"This app drains your phone battery. I got this app as I was recommended it by a reddit post however I realised I preferred the traditional method of to do lists. Ultimately, I left it alone and forgot it existed. Since I've had the app in my library it ruined my phone battery. Today I got a notification saying this app was causing battery drainage. Be careful.",
"Makes To-Do Lists fun and easy. It syncs up to the windows/pc version, which is also a great touch. Simple but effective design. Can get a bit annoying with reminders, but that's honestly a good kick for a procrastinator. Has never had bugs/crashed.",
"Its nice when you have someone managing your list for you, and all you have to do is do the work of completing the tasks. Lots of functions that i needed. You can create separate projects and subtasks and color code things. Also it automatically schedules the tasks if you writea due date. All around helpful app. And free!",
I figured this app should be pretty good since its 2019 Editors Choice. However the app lacks basic functionality like reminders unless you pay a monthly subscription price. I probably would've paid a flat one-time unlock price but a monthly subscription for a To-do list app??? What a joke.,
"Rated this app higher in the past. I've been a long time user loyal to this app. That's because I've found it to be a good product. The new update is becoming a problem as the new HUD limits the amount of screen space I have. I have upwards of 10 tasks some days, I use this app religiously. Now with the top and bottom HUD, I can only see about 5-6 tasks at a time. I'll have to use this app less now unless there are changes. They removed the scroll up to hide date function. Unfortunate.",
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.",
"Great app for managing tasks. I use the service for a couple of years but this time I did not like the design interface. It is weird, not match the screen as I would. I prefer the old style. Please doist, change this hud/layout please. It was great!",
"Note: Changing to 5 stars because (a) they responded and (b) they provided a quick fix! Love this app! Original Review: Great app BUT, as one user already noted, the task completion notification lasts entirely too long, blocking the task option buttons until it disappears. Used this app for YEARS and it didn't used to be this way. Again, great app but please fix!",
"Minimal features to force premium purchase. This app advertises itself as a an alternative to Microsoft for people forced to migrate from Wunderlists. Wunderlists was an excellent, fully featured list app with reminders, repeatable tasks, folders to group similar lists, and the ability to share any list with anyone via email or the Wunderlist app. Todoist allowed import from Wunderlist and mostly supported these features until summer 2020 update made every useful feature ONLY be in premium.",
"I've tried em all and this is hands down the best to-do list app out there for me. Easy to use, intuitive, great design, syncs across platforms... it does it all. Definitely one of my ""couldn't live without it"" apps.",
"Edit: Sync issue that could only be solved by logging out and in again. Android App did not notice the sync issue. Faq did not help. Tasks did not show up in activity log. Had to search all new tasks on phone and manually add them again on web app. Not acceptable. Simply brilliant, they put a lot of effort into a quick and smooth user interface (keyboard shortcuts, keywords, date detection) that allow me to implement GTD (almost ;) ) at the speed of my thoughts. Keep up the excellent work!",
"Definitely deserves the title of editor's choice. Amazing app, Could you please add a monthly calendar? I love that it's connected to Google Calendar, but having it's own monthly calendar would be even more useful as I can see exactly when I'm most free this month. A calendar widget would be great as well.",
"A bit inconvenient interface when adding and asigning date to the task. Other than that pretty cool intuitive UI along with minimalistic style. My first choice of todo app, even free version is good enough to keep your plans out of your head but in this app.",
"This app was great, but now in 14.1.0 I can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub-projects and their tasks at once. This is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how I use the app. Why not make this a setting I can change back, OR leave it alone altogether? I will be manually rolling this app back. Thanks for making more work for me guys. SERIOUSLY STUPID ""UPDATE"".",
"just what i needed. Trust the system. Combined with GTD, I now have a reliable method of tracking, organizing, sorting, and ranking the MANY areas of my life that need it. When I show my colleagues how I use Todoist, two things happen. 1. They say ""Ooooo, what app is that? It looks cool"" 2. They then say, ""no wonder you get so much done, you're so organize.""",
"I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
"Very good app but so many bugs present there. For no reason at all my task duplicate multiple times and all of a sudden my 4 daily tasks turn into 16. I dont know if its supposed to do this but the daily tasks im not able to complete it shows twice, one overdue and one for today. If these bugs are fixed ill gladly give a 5 star.",
"Its perfect to organize my todo list. I use it every day. I would buy a premium membership, but the only thing I would actually need would be to create more projects... So I dont think its worth it. Also its very sad that you can unlock more themes, but none of them are black. So when I would buy premium, I would still use the black theme. I dont know why there arent more themes with a dark background.",
So far so good. I like using the app better than the extension on my chromebook. It's a lot easier. It has held me accountable about making sure I'm on task for the day and allows me to set timeframes. Love that! Still learning the app but I'm pretty sure I'll figure out the rest of the features.,
Nice and simple. Works and synchronises well having had nightmare issue with Apple reminders. Thanks also to todoist team’s response to original review showing me how to view completed tasks! (It’s not obvious without the link as when you try to search completed tasks you get a pop up saying this only available in Pro so may be an idea to make the pop up more informative) Anyway I love the app!,
"It does exactly what it says on the box and it does it well. Good help documentation guiding you to finding a method that works for you. Both app and website are clean and responsive, and functionally equivalent. Regular updates and comparatively few bugs.",
One of the best to-do lists that I've ever tried. Pros: 1. Task priority arrangement; 2. Intuitive interface; 3. Variety of color schemes; 4. Every task can be arranged to a particular project; 5. Possibility to send/get tasks from other users. Cons: 1. Requires premium subscription to get notifications from the app.,
"This is a great tool to keep track of task lists. I like that it is available on Android and Ubuntu. It is fast, stable and easy to use. I'm reading Atomic Habits and plan to use the tool to track all my tasks. No more google calendar or written to do lists!",
"Recurring monthly payment for no ongoing benefit. I would be happy to pay a one time premium cost for the full version, but charging a monthly payment when there's no added value, well I'm sure they're enjoying the revenue. This one's not for me, friends.",
Really loved the app. The only reason why I'm not using it full time and using the pro version is that I can't filter what tasks go to google calendar. If this is done would be great to have several calendars with different filters like for having several projects in different calendars.,
"Excellent Todo app I was looking for to replace my paper one 🥰 simple and efficient ! It misses just 1 thing : a quick possibility when creating a new task to automaticaly recreate (or repeat) the same task every day/week/month/year. (For example i'd like to create ""pay electricity - every begining of month"") Then it's perfection !",
"No matter what other apps i try, i keep coming back to Todoist. It has the right amount of flexibility and functionality for my needs. Organizing and tagging is easy and super intuitive. Props to the Todoist team for creating an excellent app experience across all platforms!",
"Seems a good app, but can't use the basic functions without paying for premium. Eg can't have a reminder at a certain time of day without premium. Surely the basic function of a reminder app is reminders on a certain day or time. Premium is £36 so expensive, loads of free alternatives out there.....",
"No ""Undo"" button. I thought this would be a basic feature on any organising app. You can't recover an accidentally deleted task/ project, etc. I accidentally created 2 of everything and had to remove them one at a time. Needs an ""Undo"" button as a basic function.",
"Starting out this app was ok, but then I started noticing how limited this is for the free version. Only 10 projects, and where did my completed tasks go? Those should not disappear until I manually delete them. A week into using this, and the workflow I was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up. These are recurring tasks I do daily. I don't know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for ""daily"", but it's lame!",
"still getting used to it.... to having goals at all really. it's one of the weapons in my new ""Grown-Up-Arsenal™"". and by gawd, I can't think of a better tool to keep me on track. tons of details to (micro)manage, IF/when you need. share any part of your agenda with teammates. add links, and use natural language to set due dates. automatically update your calendar and vice-versa (grt pwr->grt rspncblty, blahblah). list mode<->storyboard mode. on and on. worth every ¢ for premium features too",
"After trying multiple to do list apps I found this one to best suit my needs. Its simple and effective. Unfortunately, it is rediculously buggy when syncing with google chalenders. While Todoist claims 2-way syncing, after multiple attempts my tasks kept getting deleted on Todoist and all of my chalender events on google were also deleted. I now have to waste a couple hours manually re-entering all of my google chalender events and I HOPE I don't miss an important appointment.",
"I live by lists. I've used so many apps, and nothing has the functionality of Todoist - especially for free. Slight learning curve if you want to use it to full capability, but the web site teaches you. Stop looking, you won't find better.",
"Still getting used to the UI of the app and exploring customisation. The main reason I installed this app was to set a daily routine, ways this could be easier for me is: - not having to re-type tasks everyday (not sure if there's an option for this) - having the option to keep a task crossed out/completed in the widget but also shown in the widget without disappearing (greyed/crossed out) If these features exist, that's great, how do I activate them?",
"Why do you get rid of things after making users use to it?? What happened to the press and hold to multi select? Why can't I type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like I was able to before the update. Thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones, or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same",
"I'm new to this application and so just using it for basic reminders and to do lists at the moment ... it seems simple at first, but it's full functionality (not exactly intuitive) is yet to be understood and utilized; and like most things there is a learning curve involved that must be taken into account.",
"Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick.",
"Inability to view all open-ended tasks on widget have the winning edge to one last competing app. Would also love option to check tasks as completed via checkbox to avoid two clicks. Again, as an option. Will likely reevaluate again next year in my next run of shopping apps.",
"Nice task management app...JUST cheap enough to subscribe (I do). I got it because apparently wunderlist was going down the drain, but it doesn't seem to have done...however, this works great, shared lists work nicely and it integrates well with Google Assistant. Well...it does if you go via IFTTT. The 'built in' Google Assistant Todoist interface is beyond awful, totally unusable, hence 4stars not 5. Honestly, if you use this with Google Assistant you HAVE to use IFTTT...I'm a tech guy and I make technology work for me but spending an hour trying to get 'talk to todoist' working for me was not pleasant. So frustrating...its so hard to just add a task to the project you want to add it to. It keeps thinking you're saying 'at task' not 'add task' (why would you say that when talking to a task manager?) and it can't seem to do really simple things without a 10 line conversation.  Comparing it to Wunderlist is a bit unfair since I haven't used Wunderlist for a couple of years, but compared to what I remember, this is cleaner, smoother, works better and is generally a better product. Although, if you're sticking to the free version, Wunderlist lets you do more.",
This app has come a long way in a few years. I have used a lot of task managing apps. Todoist is clean simple and it has actually replaced my whole calendar app I was using. The free version is more than good enough for everyday life managing. Highly recommend giving it a try.,
"Not super intuitive, you definitely have to spend a bit of time navigating it. Also, no function to view all to do's regardless of date; it's either ""today"" or ""future"", but you can't see entire list ranging from past due to future, which would make it easier.",
"I am very happy with this app (also the web version) and I use it daily. I really like the text parsing into project, time etc. What I would appreciate is the ability to add a place to a task and then to have a map with the tasks.",
"This is a fantastic app, and I'm thrilled to have found it. It has all the features I need. I save time every day because manipulating and updating my to do list(s) is SO fast and easy now across all my devices (PCs, Mac, and Android). Highly recommended. Many thanks to the Todoist team!",
"Two things could be improved. 1. There should be a option if I want to view the tasks organized into sub-projects in a project view. (Concerning the last update) 2. The sub-tasks could be better organized. Maybe nested inside the options, just like in Microsoft's task app.",
"Excellent app. Works without any bugs that I've found. Great way to keep on top of things. I use this for work, personal, everything. Removes stress from remembering what to do and when. I can literally throw it in the inbox and forget until my morning breakfast ""organise my day"" routine. 6 stars out of 5. Great app. 😁👏👍",
"Pleasant app to use! The application is very simple and I find it very intuitive. It is quick and easy to create new tasks. Adding time and dates to task is streamlined by using the ""auto-detecting due date feature"" within the app. I am pretty new to using ""to-do""/organization apps, and I find this application as great starter and/or a great addition to tools you already use!",
"it has all the practical features that I need in order to just keep my tasks and projects organized. it is useful and user-friendly. I might go for the premium features if I see the need for them. But even without premium, it is still a very helpful application.",
"Just getting started here, less than a month in. But this app and the cross platform features make a great prosthetic executive function. A little bit of a learning curve to get even this far but the sheer power of this system rewards climbing it. I'm hooked, and transitioning to this as one of my main tools for keeping my life moving forward. No doubt I'll be bugging the community for tips soon, bit for now I am happy.",
"The main app works great but the widget has gotten worse and worse. It now has to refresh 2, 3, and sometimes 4 times when marking a task done. And because of the delay between refreshes, it often leads to accidentally marking the wrong task as done with no way go undo it.",
"Awesome, I didn't find any single downside, everything I need can be done in an elegant and effective way. And since I have installed it, I encounter more and more excellent references for Todoist in different lists, articles and courses regarding productivity and tasks management.",
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us,
"Really great app, helped me with keeping track of school work, do wish there was an events feature to keep track of up coming events amd such, there are probably other areas of improvement as well, but for a personal planner it's pretty good, would recommend to anyone else who needs a digital planner/task manager of some sort",
A place to put those end of day things that would keep you awake; to remember or reschedule; to get organised; to feel productive but less stressed: you get the picture. You know you want a to do list organiser. This one is dynamic and helpful and a pleasing UI... and i don't normally do reviews.,
"Easy way to sync google calendar with Thunderbird calendar. I was looking for a way to carry Thunderbird task list with me. Todoist allows me to sync tasks between devices. The only thing is that the Todoist tasks end up syncing with Thunderbird ""all day"" appointments, rather than showing up on the task list. The good thing is, when you log into Todoist on phone and mark tast as completed, it comes off the Thunderbird calendar.",
"It was great at first. But after the recent update, there's problem with adding new task when using it as widget. When new task is added, it will not shown unless if it was remove and added back as widget on the screen. I couldn't find any apps as best as this. Can you please fix this :(",
"I wanted to like it, but when you download it starts populating BS ""tasks"" for you. Presumably this is meant to be a tutorial, but there is no obvious way turn it off. You have to delete the routines and tasks. I downloaded this to make lists, not to spend time deleting autogenerated garbage from my notifications.",
"Been using this app for a couple of years and overall it's been solid. It's not only a life-saver but it also provides a clean minimalistic aesthetic and intuitive options throughout the ENTIRE app. High quality developments. Seems only natural to have bugs here and there, or else they'd never be able to improve the app's functionality and innovate as a result. Attentive helpful customer support team, devs, AND they provide guides,templates and very helpful tips on their site. Keep it going :)",
"Great app, intuitive interface. You can really make it work according to your needs. I love the easy recurrence setting. A small glitch that I've been getting recently is that if I've completed one or two tasks in a day, I get a popup congratulating me on completing 3. Above 3 it counts correctly. This is with productivity turned off (goals set to 0).",
"Fantastic replacement for Wunderlist! With Microsoft finally shutting down Wunderlist, I needed to find an alternative. I tried about 5 of the most recommended Todo apps and found Todoist to be the only one that truly gave me everything that I wanted. Ive been relying on this app daily for a couple weeks now and it has not let me down yet.",
"I don't like that completed tasks disappear. There's a way to show completed tasks in your inbox setting (not your daily setting) but if you want to personalize how your tasks are sorted you cannot also see your completed tasks. So for instance I'd like to see my incomplete tasks in order from soonest due date to latest, and I also want the satisfaction of seeing what tasks I've completed today. It won't let you do both at the same time though.",
"Todoist has always been one of the most useful apps for me. I have migrated to offline world recently and have decided to plan my works in my journal (instead of Todoist and GCal). However, still I needed a listing app. After a bunch of search between the apps, Todoist is still the best app I can use for making lists 😇 (by the way, I should ignore some of its features like daily goals and replace the term of ""project"" with ""list"" in my mind! But it is a perfect choice for me 😊)",
"This app saved my academic career. Without it, I was neglecting my time-tracking and coursework. With it, I cleared the metaphorical bar instead of tripping over it. Its features are well-explained and easy to use or ignore at your leisure.",
"Great app, very helpful for to do lists and projects. Note to the team, I do find confirming a time for a task difficult. I can choose the time easily, but then there is no ""ok"" button or something like that.",
"nice app but the notes function at least should be free in order for this to really work for people. and it'd be a good idea to actually see the project's color when we're inside the project. other than that really good app, even made me plan stuff and i've never been much of a planner. i hate planning but it made me enjoy it, great for jotting down new ideas and stuff you wanna do whether big or small",
"Overall very good. Just a but frustrating that features such as reminders and notes are premium features. Also, moving sub-tasks about can be a bit fiddly but I understand they are working on revamping that system. Has been perfectly serviceable it spite of these things though.",
"Enjoy the app a lot, use the mobile and web version, as well as browser extension. One thing Id like to request from developers is Linux account integration. I'm pretty sure this function existed in the past and allowed to integrate Todoist with, for example, built-in Ubuntu to-do app. On the other hand, native Linux application would suffice, too. All things considered, the app offers many features one could want and subscription offers even more fine ways to tinker and tune one's experience",
"Good app. However, no means to minimize lengthy notes in the inbox. You have to scroll through the entire notes to move from one task to the next. Let there be ways to minimize / expand lengthy notes.",
"Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again ! Updates have now cleared the problem, and we're back to normal.",
"Just think of this app as your brain 🧠 🤣Anything you think of put it in the inbox. This is your RAM( Random access memory ) power. No storage required, give ur brain the much needed space 🙌🏽. Take a look at YouTube video tutorials. There are a lot of people using this app with really good setups. Definitely set this using ur computer. I believe this is the only way to link ur calendar. Gmail has the best integration.",
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!",
"I think I like this app, and have only just begun to use it since download 4 days ago. Yet I've recieved what feels like 40 emails from them. I just need a to-do list on my phone, not a community of todoist's to be part of- that's just too much to do! I got this app to help organize my life, not clutter it with emails. Edit: I was too quick to judge this app. There is a reason for is excellent reviews. It goes deep and the programming is excellent. This free software could benefit a business!",
"I used to use Evernote and had no intention of ever changing. Evernote updated their app and it was a mess. This led me to try Todoist. I didn't know what I was missing. Todoist is unbelievably easy, fast and effective in helping me manage my life and my business. Thank you, Todoist!",
"I can't believe some team can write such a beautiful app..you think and this app have that feature for you...of course you need to explore this app a bit... fantastic...I would have rated 6 stars is what my feeling is..I am a fan of this app...try plug in for outlook, sync is very fast..comment is very powerful...tags, filters, projects, smart schedule....wow!!!!",
"Good app. a lot of useful features. As a premium customer, I would like to have the ability to export to an excel or spreadsheet program for reporting purposes. Also, the app freezes a lot on Windows",
"My bad. You have to be on a Wi-Fi network that your watch recognizes in order to refresh the projects. Still, I would like for Bluetooth to suffice. Otherwise great concept. Good way to organize tasks. I have yet to unleash the full potential of this, without paying, for now.",
"My favorite to-do app out of the insane plethora of to-do apps. I tried a lot but this one stuck with me the most. The key for me was how simple it is but powerful at the same time. A quick ""Water plants every other Saturday p3 #House"" correctly identifies the list it belongs to, sets up the frequency and marks its priority. This app seriously puts me in control of my day so nothing ""slips"" my mind any more. I have recommended it to my boss and he also loves it.",
"very disappointed after i got premium, i was hoping to be able to set goals on a weekly schedule planner but none of that. instead, it keeps tracks on how many tasks i completed overall. but who cares about that? it isn't gonna help me at all. the fact that there isn't any trial to see if we like it or not and we have to pay just to regret it is disappointing.",
"Useful, though there is a learning curve. Getting tasks to nest properly under a single larger task can be fiddly. A lot of features are only available for pay, which is fair. The free version serves its purpose (i.e. keeping track of large numbers of small tasks across multiple devices).",
"Came highly recommended. Tried it. HATE that I can't see the subtasks in a project(why even..), and apparently that's a recent update! Well no one seems to like this feature, or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not, so hope you guys bring it back. Will use it then. Another observation- most of the top-notch features are unavailable to non-Premium users, and not many are willing to subscribe. Seems a bit unfair. One time payment would be great. Will that change?",
"Best Project/Productivity App: The premium version of the app has been well worth the $. I have ADHD and struggle with being overwhelmed by the amount of things that need to be done. This app is becoming my ""second brain"" where I can throw everything in, organize it in a way that makes sense to me, and if I only want to look at what I need to accomplish that day I just look at ""Today"". The ability to create sub tasks for my sub tasks is what I've been looking for in other apps but couldn't find",
"After almost two months, I'm hooked. I can't believe I haven't found this app till now, really helping me get over my hare-brained organization skills. One tip is to start small. 6 tasks per day should be easy, with each task not taking more than an hour. I've now built up to 10 tasks per day and usually accomplish 8. Here's to progress!",
"Amazing app, been using it to manage most of my routines. The auto date recognition is superb, though for some reason they don't give you the ability to view a particular day's completed task, it's not much but I kinda missed that satisfactory feeling that I get when I tick off tasks in Any.do.",
"Since the latest update, the widget I use to check Today's tasks does not update the tasks from one day to another. It's a quite annoying bug, and I can manually force the update by switching to ""Upcoming"" then back to today. Please fix it and I'll gove it 5 stars, this is quite a good app if it wasn't for this issue, which affects how I mainly use it.",
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.,
"I've been using this app and the GTD method to stay focused and organized. My life is pretty crazy. I have 4 young kids, a husband, a house, parents who live with us; I'm a full-time student and a part-time massage therapist. I've also started grant writing on the side. I love being able organize my tasks lists and calendar in one app! I could not have completed a 19-credit course load plus the rest of my life responsibilities without Todoist!",
"After almost a month of daily use, I love it so far! Especially in widget form where I can add tasks, reschedule, edit, etc right there on the homescreen without having to go to the app itself all the time. The added themes/customizability is an added plus as well.",
I'm paying for this and just discovered 41 tracking events in the past 5 minutes. No thanks; I'll pay someone else.,
"Perfect app to help you organize your day and goals. I'll take some time to look at the premium features because there's a whole lot! Sad that all the in-app links with useful info always redirect you to the main page, forcing you to search for them manually.",
"Amazing app. I'm using Pro plan, since I have many projects with different tasks. The app became very handy when developers added board view. The only thing for me missing is a notepad. I would love to have a notepad in the app, so I can make some notes withing my project in overall. Let's say, a wider version of comments feature. Thank you!",
"Initially I was really impressed, and I like the app, but there seems to be one big problem... The search feature. It does not search comments at all. I use comments to keep detailed information of the task, without being able to search and find information in the comments it severely limits the functionality of the app. I was hoping filter would work, but it does not either. That pretty much eliminates the functionality for me.",
Simple and comfortable design. I think a calendar section can be handy (I use 'Upcoming' but it's not so intuitive) and also when scheduling: It's prefer to choose day+hour at the same session- in Todoist it's seperate. But overall it's great.,
"I like it. Wish I could change and reorder events on the widget. Also while typing out bullet reminders for my next projecr, a burst of inspiration came over me and I typed for a while in the subcategories to later organize in word or docs. When scrolling down, I realized multiple paragraphs disappeared with no way to get them back. Wish it auto saved AND added a link or page for typing like converting to word or Google docs if the note reminder winds up being an essay report.",
"Great for setting my to-do list and managing a team. Definitely makes it easier for me to keep pace with all the things I have to do and ensure that everyone on my team is clear on their responsibilities. Would be great to be able to name a manager for each project so that the owner executes, but the manager can know what to follow up on. Also, a reassign feature would be helpful for when a task owner plans to be out of office for any reason.",
"Remains very useful. Only minor irritation is icons for premium features are visible, so occasionally click on them to be told they are not available, leading me to shout at the machine. Also if a task shows as overdue because I forgot to mark it done, I would like to be able to mark it completed yesterday",
"One of the best apps I use. Less buggy than Facebook. They think of useful features, like having a button that takes me into the app after adding a task in the home screen widget. Shows that features are well-thought out. It's the little things 🙂",
"I've been using this app paid version for years. I use it to manage projects, employees, work task, personal tasks, grocery lists, etc. It's amazing. You owe it to yourself to at least try the free version. My only suggestion would be to add some sort of easy integration to add emails or copy/pastes to a to do item.",
"Constantly buggy. I've used this app for five years, and they are always pushing bad releases. Right now there is a crash expanding lists, which would have been found with some quick testing. Several years ago I filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists. Every few months I check in and out still isn't fixed. The web app is not letting you expand sections. The windows app was scrambling the order for months. They must do zero quality control.",
"Excellent app, takes a little bit to understand all you can do with it but once you do, even without premium it is fantastic. I use the widget to organize everything i want to do and having it has been a huge help in increasing my focus and productivity.",
"Recent major update has strongly impeded on usability of app. I understand and appreciate the focus on subtasks and some other features, however I think the developers have severely misjudged the actual most common user stories. Was always a big fan, paid subscriber for many years, but this update was a major letdown. Unnecessary changes for something that was working almost perfectly.",
"Not all tasks reach completion, some need to be deleted and rightly so. But by design delete action is tucked away under three dots menu and then behind confirmation message. Thus making deleting tasks in bulk deliberately harder, probably to keep fake karma number high and jack up usage statistics.The swipe action on the list should be customisable so delete action can be set when its swipe left. Also since recent updates the upgrade to premium nudge is slapped everywhere.",
"A perfect, simplistic GTD tool that works across all platforms including wear watches. Has just enough features on the free version, that is very much appreciated. I'd be happy to upgrade to the paid version if I need the advanced features.",
"The app is good and user interface is simple. The thing is in free version, the projects are limited to 5 and you cant add descriptions to tasks! Tick tick give 9 projects and can add description even to sub-tasks! Would be nice if we have a merged version between them :"")",
"Need an option to default show the completed tasks. And a Kanban like board view.. like trello with thumbnail support. Overall it's a very good app.. and I have got 1 year Premium.. The best part for me is the notification and reminder syncing across all my devices. All mobiles, laptops and desktops.",
"With my ADHD, this app is a godsend. I use it for a multitude of tasks and it almost certainly makes me better at following through. Lists are handy but Todoist takes it to the next level. Five stars are definitely earned. For me, it's worth the few dollars/month to go premium, but even without all the additional features this app is a must-have for anyone who is in need of that extra mental shelf-space.",
"Great personal and project mangement app. Allows me to see the big picture and smaller supporting steps in an intuitive way, helping me to easily break down overwhelming intersecting projects and plug them in my schedule. Simple and straightforward, easy to use, no glitches.",
"Works as described. Few things I think would improve... Screen widget: Don't delete without confirmation. Plus sign to expand task to show comments. More customization of appearance (individual colors for background, text, etc. not just the included fixed selections)(background transparency).",
Android syncing does not work,
"I use this app everyday and upgraded to a subscription plan. The UI is pleasent enough especially with dark mode. I appreciate how modular the app is: you assign tasks for the day, have them repeat on specific days, assign tasks to projects, and add subtasks. This app has enhanced my productivity. My only complaint is that repeating subtasks don't visually disappear after having been completed that day. I do hope the developers make repeating subtasks behave identically to their parent tasks.",
"Awesome! Was using Wunderlist, but they are going away. I tried a few others. They are all so similar now. But this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads. Also, it is as simple as Wunderlist. I did have to pay $29 and Waunderlist was free for the most important functions, so that was different. But after using the app for a week I'm sold. Not a better app out there for my purposes. KISS- keep it simple stupid. And this app does that.",
"Of all the apps I had like google calendar, tasks and other stuff, this has stood out of all. It's easy, fast and simple. Also, the UI is what appeals me the most and the widget is quite a good feature since I can quickly look at my whole week just by swiping the list from widget. Overall the best in its category.",
"This app optimized my college workflow. Having separate categorized lists for each subject is great. Previously I was using an app that only let you make a check list, this lets you have separate checklists for each category. So for example in my stats class I have separate dated check lists with homework, readings, and reminders. Great stuff!",
"On the widget, you should have make it able to open the app when we click the task (make us easier to do the editing). And also when input new task, I prefer it was put on top instead of below so we can keep track to avoid double input. But so far still ok. Thanks.",
"This is without a doubt one of the best apps I have. It took me a year (2016/17) switching one productivity app to another.. google keep, evernote and google calendar all to keep my tasks and reminders the way I need em. This blessed app gave me all these in one, and a lot more. It helped me get weekly status reasults, boosts and karma, labels, prioritizing feature, Filters, the awesome widget on home screen... i just love it. Funny there're still features i havent digged yet",
"I've been using todoist for almost 6 months every day, it's perfect for my ADHD addled brain. With Todoist I can manage day to day little things without being bogged down by an over-complicated UI. My work has improved, my habits have improved, and my girlfriend no longer gets annoyed because I forget to do the dishes 30 times.",
This has saved me from myself! I feel like I am always so disorganized I can never find my tasks or set a schedule. Being able to write it all in one place🥳 is phenomenal and having it auto organize based on various things has been a life saver. my ADHD brain will never be able to live without this app!,
"Amazing organization. It helps me a lot organising my day. I used google Calendar earlier but didn't find it very friendly (no offence). However, this app really helped me a ton. One star less because i have a feedback to share, which i feel.is a downside. Some tasks might span over days, say from Monday to wednesday but this app only takes specific days. It would be nice to have an option to let it spread over days.",
"Todoist is extremely helpful with my productivity; its layout is intuitive and it's organized very well. It has a minimalistic design while still having many features that other apps do not have, given that I've tried many agenda setting/to do list apps, and this has worked the best for me.",
"Nice app. Does the job it claims to do really well through a simple, intuitive, and easy to learn UI. Also, does not overwhelm with ads. They are placed well and do not continually interfere with app usage.",
"Best to do list app I've used. Super seamless and easy to learn without forcing you to learn their paradigm. Lots of features available to organize, but you don't have to use them if you don't want to. Highly recommend, especially as a UX Designer and Researcher. Very flexible and so quick to get started.",
"I tried the free version. I liked the way, that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself, but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus. I prefer to use Google task app, that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task.",
"I have a tendency to be a scattered, distracted worker. This has helped me focus, plan, and write down things when they occur to me (instead of spending energy trying to remember). This also utilizes my phone being on me all the time as a strength in productivity instead of a hindrance.",
"The app has helped me alot be more productive, the interface is good and everything works nicely. To todoist team I would love a functionality to track my habits, i.e. the tasks I repeat on daily basis, currently I use another app for that(habits loop). Cause adding a repetitive tasks daily becomes tedious. So if that can be added to it'd be just awesome. Anyways keep up the good work. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",
"Incredibly intuitive to how I think and is even better than how I would've designed such a product. Looking forward to enjoying additional features this company incorporates into the app as I can already see from existing features that they make smart business and technological decisions. Would love a calendar view, but I understand that it's not really a calendar app. Would love to be able to make entire ""sections"" recurring and remove character limitations. Keep up the good work! 👍🏻",
"Free version does everything I want - handy reminder list, easy to move tasks around, smart recurring tasks, clear way to organize home, work and other tasks, smooth transition between mobile and desktop versions. Switched from my old task organizer to Todoist a few months ago and have never regretted the switch!",
"Love Todoist! I love that I can remove all the clutter of my projects from my head and put them in the app organized. Besides normal ""to-do"" like paying Bill's, or dog to the vet, it helps me organize hobby projects, automobile maintenance, shopping lists, projects at work, and even listing fun things to do around town (like a bucket list). I haven't used some of the advanced features yet.",
I've been using Todoist for many years now dor both professional and private tasks. I paid early on for the full version and it's worth buying it eg. to set reminders and for many other important features. I have no idea what else could I use as effectively as this app for this crazy problem of managing my tasks all around... Good job guys! Thx!,
"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",
"Used Todoist years ago, then went on to MS TO-DO. Couldn't get To Do to sync with Calendar. went back to Todoist and realised how awesome it is. Simple, professional, smooth, efficient. It syncs with everything and the Ul is just perfect! Seriously, I've tried them all, Asana, Trello, ToDo, etc. Todoist is the 'sticker'",
"Very good at helping me stay organized. I would like the ability to make expiration dates for tasks so if i don't do them by a certain point they disappear, but that's really the only ""missing"" feature that i'd want and use.",
"Life changing. Worth the subscription price. I have tried many task apps. Love the sub tasks, labels vs projects, sharing, app integrations, color coding, repeating task options, due dates and clean anesthetics. The ability to enter due dates in abbreviated natural language is so time saving. Encouragements for completing tasks also cute and fun.",
"Todoist is great, no questions about it. Well built, nicely designed, regularly updated. I've been a premium user since Wunderlist was on the chopping block. However, I realized I'm paying $36 each year for essentially one feature: task reminders. Additionally, 2 users in 1 household on 1 budget pay 100% more for both to use the app. I think that's ridiculous so I'm out.",
"I love this app, but would it be possible to Sort the tasks in the widget according to the already set preferences? It's quite irritating to add a task from the widget which has higher priority than those on the list, only to see it added at the bottom of the list (off screen), thus obliging me to then open app, choose Sort, and manually reorder tasks (with same preference, Priority) so that the new task will go straight to the top of the list on the widget. The widget should automatically sort newly added items according to established preferences. Thanks!",
"Great app, but needs to be able to switch accounts easily. I have an account for personal life, and work life. On my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist.",
Easily the best app I have EVER installed. I pay for Premium and I probably will for the rest of my life but it is beyond worth it. I recommend this app to everyone I meet that I think could benefit from knowing about it. I love the new features that have been added such as sub-tasks and the organization tools and predictive tagging make this app 10x better than even it's closest competitor. No other to do list app can even hold a candle to this one.,
"I needed a To do app, after trying 5 or 6 this is by far the best. I have it installed on 5 phones within my family now as well as pc's and Mac's to make sure tasks that were forever being forgotten are no longer left behind. The only drawback I have found so far is that you cannot set a reoccurring event. There are many tasks that I do for work or home that happen weekly, monthly or annually. I can go through and add events in the future but this would be a huge task. Am I missing something?",
"I'd like it except the widget is the most important feature for me. It displayed my inbox for about a week and now comes up blank. The tasks are there tho. I can read them if I open them, or open the app. :-( You're not the only organizer with this problem tho. Android 9.",
"It lets you takes notes provided you've payed for premium. In any case, it's one of the best apps I've tried: it lets you stay productive, doesn't have other things that would affect your overall focus by spending too much time doing things within the app, and creating tasks couldn't be easier.",
"Todoist is absolutely amazing and completely love it after switching off Wunderlist once Microsoft started breaking it and completely love it, which is amazong since I liked Wunderlist so much (I stopped once Microsoft started breaking it). The only complaint I have is that the annual cost for getting all of the features is a little high so my liking, hence the 4 stars. Make it a little lower or male it REALLY worth the $$ and it'll easily jump to 5.",
"Edit to my original review: this issue has been fixed very quickly by the devs! Working beautifully again and extremely happy with the speed of their work. Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days. Edit: I have emailed details of the bug to support.",
"Update: notifications have returned. I would go back to 5 stars but my four day interaction with customer service was disappointing, including telling me there would be no prorated refund for loss of service. >>I've been communicating with cust service and every time they say ""try this we think it's fixed"" it isn't. SUPER disappointing, unfortunately will be canceling my annual premium subscription if not fixed today.",
"Easy way to organize myself and my family. I'm looking forward to continued use. I'm currently using the free version, so I can't rate the full version. There is enough usability with the free version for personal use. I assume the enhanced features would be beneficial for project planning with a team.",
"I particularly like how it transforms normal sentences into scheduled items, such as, ""Clean the washer filter every two months starting this Friday"". I upgraded to Premium after using this for a couple of years, because a few of the remaining features (like Notes) seemed useful, and the app developers had earned to right to some of my money, as I saw it.",
"I've used the app for a few weeks now and I'm very impressed! Usually calendar organization and planning is a drag for me, but this app has made it so much easier, even on the free version. I just wish I could see a full calendar of the month with tasks/colors.",
"at first just a couple things needed to get used too but this app has seriously saved me mentally- I get very overwhelmed even when theres not much to do so being able to write it all down and tick things off is very helpful and is helping me destress!!! i seriously recommend this to anyone who has similar anxiety/depressive feelings of being overwhelmed no matter the task, and/or executive dysfunction... its really helped me.",
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.",
"Life changing! Very much needed for 2021! If I could give this app more than the limited 5 stars, I would. Beautiful interface. It didn't take me too long to get a hang of it as well. So much more more organised than the other planner apps I have come across :)",
"TODoist is a FANTASTIC app! It is one of the better apps that I have worked with in business, yet to be honest I first stumbled upon it by looking for a timer app that would interact / syncronize with Trello. It was then that I read that ToDoist DOES sync with many other apps, and that if I were using Pomodone (a pomodoro timer app), then all that I do in ToDoist would be readily synced into Pomodone, allowing me to not only schedule and prioritize my time but ALSO to discipline myself to accomplish it through timers. If you are using ToDoist than Pomodone seems like it was built purely to enable your productivity goals in ToDoist! Together, these apps are unbeatable! Having said all of this, ToDoist is alone ABSOLUTELY worth the time and money to learn and to purchase! I have used MANY different scheduling or GTD systems, and ToDoist is far and away the best that I have used! Do yourself a great favor and learn the keyboard shortcuts!! These are very powerful in action. The app’s ability to understand common language / phrasing is simply uncanny! REALLY WELL DONE!!! I highly recommend ToDoist. I mysefl committed to changing the system that I was already using, (largely because of the tie-in between ToDoist and Trello and Pomodone), and I can certify that it was WELL worth my investment of time!",
I like this app because it erases things that you checked off when you click the circle. There are other to do lists that do not do this and you have to go to multiple screens to delete what you did. Very easy to use and a very happy,
"As I've gotten older, those ""Oh, I must remember to xyz"" thoughts get forgotten more readily. Short term memory isn't what it was. With Todoist, I can schedule, verbally, by Alexa, or by simply typing, any reminder. Such as ""take garbage out every Thursday at 7am"", ""change bank passwords every 2 months"". Todoist software is a great add-on to my life because it supplements my normal productivity engine. My productivity has always been a sense of pride. Todoist let's it continue to be so.",
"I was using Todoist for more than 3 years now. Mostly free version, since its enough for me to track my tasks. Todoist is very intuitive and easy to use productivity tool. it helped me a lot, backing up my memory and reminding me of important actions. 5 out of 5. Thank you for a great app and service!",
"This is a great app. It can be as simple or complicated as you want. Upgrading gives you access to labels which can help with context and filtering. Depending on how you organize, this can be a big help, but the app works great even without upgrading.",
Its a very good tool for keeping on track but I have adhd and its difficult for me to use sometimes since It doesn't include reminders or alarms unless you pay which I can't do. Overall its a very good app and can be used on desktop too but I would like if it was free to get reminders,
"Coming from Wunderlist, this is the best one I found. There is one thing which I find irritating. The added item goes to the bottom of the list. Can you add an option to sort by reverse date? That would make it perfect list for me.",
"It's a great app with a bug that occasionally unmoves the task you just tried to reorganize the order of. It's frustrating to have a full day of tasks, try to put them in the order they belong in, and have each one undo itself and need placing twice.",
"Largely a good app. The beat To Do app I've found. -1 Star because the app has started to put out a ""Turn on location reminders"" notification, and there is no way to disable that (I can't even find the setting, even if I did intend to turn it on, which I don't).",
"Can no longer set reminders without upgrading to pro version. Defeats the purpose of the app. This was a great app, very easy to use and the widget was so much better than other similar apps. But they just had to ruin it. I'm uninstalling.",
I love thus App! We use it as a team at work and it helps us get things done! We dont forget projects plus we can see who has completed what and it does 85% of everthing I want it to do and it does it well. The two things I hope they add is the ability to wtite notes and have monthy views with out the need of your calander. If they do that it would do everthing that I want 100% of the ways I wouf like to use it. That would bring my rating up to 5 stars,
Todoist is by far the greatest app I have ever used. It runs my entire life and I can't imagine parting from it ever. I have probably used every major productivity app across every platform and I always come back to this one. The flexibility and feature set it provides is completely unmatched by anything else.,
"To doist is wonderful app but it lacks one major thing, that... we can not insert a new bullet or line in btwn lines. Dynalist has this feature. If todoist implements this feature it will be lot beneficial for end users. for now new task always goes bottom of the last task n then we have to move it and reallign or readjust the sequence.",
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.",
"Todoist has truly changed my life! I am far more purposeful and productive from using it and the sense of achievement and fulfillment from this is great. I use the projects function to organise all of my work tasks (I'm a primary teacher) but I also make sure to schedule time to spend on hobbies, skills, interests and personal goals, and I'm making far more progress on all of that than I ever was previously. I'm pretty much hooked for life now, Todoist! 😁",
"I was really surprised at how effective this app is. As a incurable procrastinator I had little hopes this app would have any positive impact on my persistent lack of motivation to do anything. But it worked! I load the app with things I need to do at the start of the day and by the end I have done them all. I often add items to my list throughout the day and manage to get them done too. This may not sound like much , but to me it's been a miracle.",
"I've gone through many To Do lists apps and this has been my favorite for over a year. If you haven't given this a try then you are doing yourself a disservice. Clean, night mode, not glitchy, and the free version is 5/5.",
"Might be slow in adding more features compared to other apps, but I think, it's because of their focus on the app's reliability - which is very much evident. Long time user, tried other apps, but I keep coming back to todoist with how useful and functional it is. It's worth trying and keeping.",
"I really enjoy todoist. I have to compartmentalize my task lists and being able to create separate projects, sections, and add labels helps keep me organized. Having the functionality to add reminders, comments, share, and put priorities on tasks further makes this a useful app.",
"I reviewed the software to provide 80 projects in free version and collaborators. On installing the product today, it has reduced the projects and collaborators all of a sudden. I was so confused looking at the pricing page show different things all of a sudden to understand there has been an update. Though the app is good, but it's targeted towards premium users more than the basic users. Wouldn't serve the purpose. I guess I would have to program my own to get pretty basic features in an app!",
"The problem with most todo apps is they overcomplicate it, making it hard to use. This app excels at being simple to just add a task but also contains the power to be truly customizable. The app has saved me multiple times. Worth the subscription.",
"It's a great app. Thank you. I wish it would let me to write time and cost of each task I list, so I could calculate how much I need to invest, also it would be nice if I could organize my tasks based on priority and change their priorities if necessary.",
"App is great, one thing I would love is a calendar view of a whole month with tasks. It could be really helpful at planning. And maybe some sort of a habit tracker where you can see when you completed your habits and when you failed to do so :]",
"So far, really great app. Keeps everything organized and not overwhelming. I love how it is available on multiple platforms as well. Great productivity tool. I wish I didn't have to pay a subscription for extra features. I'd like a one-time purchase for the full version.",
"So i dont understand, I just installed this app *on my phone*, so why do I need to ""continue"" with an email account, Google, or Facebook? Can't I just open the app and check things out to see how it works without ""signing up"" for something? Update: Okay, everything is stored in the cloud. Well I guess this App isn't for me then, since I want my data stored on my local device. But that is really too bad as it sounded like an interesting app. (I don't want to use a fake email address).",
"I've been a dedicated ""To do list"" user for decades and Todoist is literally the online app of my dreams. I've tried several and all had shortcomings. From desired features to seamless integration across multiple platforms, Todoiest has it all and does it all. I'm loving it! If you use To Do lists daily I highly recommend Todoist.",
"After starting to use todoist I've seen subtle, yet real improvement to my life. Some productivity boost, but the biggest betterment is in my mental state. With a solid service like this I feel secure and confident knowing that I can outsource remembering my responsibilities and deadlines, and know that I will get to all tasks I enter because it just works that well. Todoist also has an open API, so I set up a script to email me the most important tasks of the day every morning 👌. Bonus points",
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium",
"This app can potentially change your life, and that's not hyperbole! It's intuitive to use and seemlessly updates your data across devices. I'm deducting a ⭐ because it has a paid subscription rather than a one-time payment.",
"I use this app everyday for work and home. It really helps keep me organized and keeps me working to priorities. Todoist continues to make usability improvements that add icing to the cake. I have a paid subscription...as a bit of a miser, that pretty much tells what I think of it. Thumbs up.",
"Great tool for implementing the ""Getting Things Done"" methodology. The sub-subtasks under subtasks, options to label, and add due date to each task (including subtasks) are excellent features that are present in TODOIST. It's integration with Google Calendar is again amazing that help you to remember and review all your tasks at same place. I recommend this app to users who intend to efficiently multitask.",
"This looked promising, but I literally had no welcome or intro to using this app whatsoever, and it came across to me as too fiddly and time consuming to work it all out. Honestly, sometimes it's best to keep things simple - writing lists and goals shouldn't be made this complicated. I've uninstalled and found a more basic app, this 1 isn't for me.",
"It's good, but everytime I mark a task as completed on the widget I have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again. You guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime. Cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way I dislike constantly.",
"Great app but need a calendar & a timer to make it complete. Im a visual person and I love time blocking so long lists overwhelm me, for todoist to shine at the top you guys need to implement a calendar and then a timer at some point. Visually and speed of entry are outstanding but need just those to make it complete.",
"I once rated this app and company a five star. However long, with their recent updates they have utterly failed to test the user experience. All the alerts.settings are changed so you get texts, notifications and emails when you had turn them off. The suggested time zone change so their app ""will.function correctly"" breaks the assigned due date times. I like to see companies trying to improve, but if they are this lazy with the user experience who lazy are they with customer data. Lost of all trust here.",
"The widget, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app, doesn't seem to be updating anymore, even when I click the refresh button. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed.",
"it's a great getting things done app, can be simple to use, can be very functional. Cross platoform and just nice to use. 4 starts are because the premium which unlocks features that calendar has, costs £36 a year, which i think is too much for what it's offerring.",
I got tired of keeping paper lists of things I had to accomplish & having to write the uncompleted ones over & over. Then the irritation of carrying the list & keeping track of where I put it. Now I carry the list on my Todoist & enjoy marking them off but reminding me what I need to work on. Great tool!,
"Giving Todoist a 2-star review because the sync issues are so frequent that it makes the app a pain to use. Real shame because the interface is really sleek and there are some great features. Sync issues I've encountered: - I try to add a task and it doesn't actually add because it didn't sync for some reason - I try to add a task using the laptop app and it doesn't add because sync issue - I try to move a task up in the list and it doesn't work, goes back to initial position",
"Organized, takes a slight bit of getting used to, but highly recommended. Have gotten several people into using it & is effective to the degree that I may push for my company to embrace its use as well. DEVS: Can we get a slightly different visual indicator for the ""Today"" & ""Inbox"" screens? I often edit my own tasks & those I have collab'd on, & often catch myself forgetting what screen I'm in. Colored bar down one side, slightly tinted background to match project color, etc. KEEP IT UP! :)",
"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.",
"Essential to my sanity. I can sync to-dos with my calendars and send tasks from my email (with attachments) to my to-do list. This app is the one thing keeping me sane and somewhat looking like I'm on top of things. Well, mostly sane anyway.",
So far has been a great replacement form Apples Reminders. I always used Reminders app to sync all my tasks between phone table and computers and switching to Android I was worried. But this has worked perfect. Even better. It syncs with everything and has a nice and clean organized interface. I'm digging it.,
"The only way this would be better is if there were a built-in calendar and notifications for items with a time deadline. But overall I love the app, especially the seamless syncing between desktop and mobile apps.",
"If you want to track tasks via a todo list interface, this is the app for you. Having an inbox to dump stuff into is a god send, allowing me to focus on what needs doing today by getting everything else out of my head for processing at a later time. Highly recommended.",
"This has to be the best free app there is. It is thoroughly AMAZING and it does everything I need it to do. I love recording the things I need to do--getting them out of my head and into the app gives me so much peace of mind. I use it to organize and schedule all kinds of tasks, both personal and professional. Highly recommended!",
"I had been happily using Todoist for over a year until it started sending me junk notifications (an attempt to get you to open the app) on days I didn't have any tasks scheduled, it wasn't possible to disable these without disabling the notifications for my actual tasks as they had them under the same notification category. This rendered the app useless to me so I've uninstalled it, nice work team.",
"Easily one of the most useful tools I've discovered in my lifetime. For me, the cross platform functionality and simple UI just works. I also love the brand and the company, and how they support remote work and promote design philosophy.",
I made the switch from post-it notes to this app to be more environmentally responsible maybe 2 years ago and haven't looked back. Great free app that has all the basics and then some necessary for keeping things in check. Highly recommend.,
"Very intuitive and easy to use. The scheduling and recurrence features are great for setting up daily drumming practice sessions, as well as getting other life stuff done. Karma points are an added bonus that help keep me motivated.",
Your reminder system could use some improvements please. If we could just click the clock and a watch would pop up where we just input the time or you suggest intervals of 30 min or 1 hour. At the moment we have to type out the time and it's not efficient. I use the app for my sales team 8 hours a day. Please do something about this.,
Editing (changing) the timing and frequency of recurring events is infuriating enough for me to give it only one star. This should be one of the most fundamental and easiest things to do in an app that bills itself as a top notch time management/ PM tool.,
Lovely App. A perfect app. I had gone through a lot of apps but this one is just awesome. I am using it and it's very useful. Very simple and I like the way it reminds of pending uncompleted tasks via phone and e mails. It's a very important tool for me on daily basis. Bravo to the developers of this app.,
"I have lived by Todoist for the last four years. I love tgat it syncs with my Google calendar and how easy it is to set recurring items and reschedule. My only complaint is that i have to go to my Google calendar to look more than 7 days out. I havent tried any other to-do list apps, but ive been quite pleased with this one!",
"This app is easy to use and has good options to schedule and organize tasks. I got it because it was recommended by Tim Challies in his book Do More Better (a Christian book on productivity). Adding, scheduling, and organizing tasks is easy with this app. The trick is to consistently do the tasks that you add to the app!",
"Todoist is the best. I've been trying to change to other apps, buy todoist is easy to use, has many options to manage tasks and projects. It has also nice and clean UI. Creating tasks by natural language is really making it fast to create task.",
"2/11/23 - Recent update doubles down on gamifying the app. I had to delete my goals to keep from getting daily and weekly pop-ups when reaching them. There should be an option to stop these pop ups for the people who don't want a full-screen celebration everytime they do their normal day-to-day functions. Not everyone wants a cheering section all the time. Glad it's here for those who do, but I want to be able to turn it off.",
"Really useful app, i like that i can set repeating reminders. It would be nice to be able to do something like ""lunch prep sunday-thursday"" and have that repeat, rather than ""lunch prep every sunday"" ""lunch prep every monday"", but it's a small thing. I'd also like reminders, but that's a premium thing and they have to make money somehow so oh well. overall i do love this app!",
Love everything about the app except the new swipe animations are awful. I swipe right to complete and the task used to just completely swipe off the screen but now it bounces back and just fades away. It makes me feel like I didn't swipe correctly every time.,
"Great app!!! After I used almost all the apps for tasks and events. The enhancements almost every week/month 👏 👍 👌 The support team is excellent, well knowledge and contribution. I have more than a year with the premium version; I won't think to go to another app.",
"Mainly using it because it integrates with spark email app but the chrome extension is great and features like filters, labels, and search are pretty good but can be better. No task descriptions which is weird but task comments make it work. Overall pretty good.",
I have nothing but good things to say about this app. A few months ago I started using the desktop version and it's helped my productivity a ton. I'm a former sticky note addict and todoist has been the cure lol This app is entirely what you make it though. Put in some effort with creating tasks and it'll pay off with time saved later on!,
"App is very easy to use, with a simple guide when you first download it! Only used it for one day so far, but found the organising quite efficient and helped me to streamline my brain quite easily without the mess of pen and paper! Very happy so far!",
buy the premium version! i have tried many apps for my gtd. but this is the one that works. its got an easy UI so you can add and edit tasks without going into different screens. you can priortize itsms which i find very useful as it shows you what is your primary focus,
Great app for managing my ever growing to do list. There is the option to add tags to separate between work and personal projects. There is also a great feature that allows you to rapidly prioritise tasks by typing p1 p2 p3. Would recommend.,
Great little app that does exactly what you want it to and more! Helps in my job to self-manage and organise tasks as well as setting individual goals for myself. Even started using it as reminders for things at home! Very handy and super useful,
"This app is a great to do list app, and it makes a great homework planner. I use this with the board view at school and it is awesome. I have a school Chromebook and the PWA is top-notch, and the Android app is great at sending notifications for homework assignments. Also, the widgets are great and the free plan. 10/10 experience!",
I love this app as a simple way to keep me on track and help me plan out what needs to be done. I only wish that i could configure it to a modified day structure. Since i work 3rd shift i stay up all night and once it goes past 12 it complains that i missed a task. When in fact I'm just barely halfway through the day.,
"Bought a premium as a gift to my friend on 21 Dec, had soon many issues with getting this pro to her account!!! At the end, my money was reimbursed and her pro cancelled. With a second try they gave us a link to pay, but their price was 25% higher than initial price (we were trying to arrange annual subscription). Bitterly disappointed with their service. Was left without pro. Thankfully, got my money back. But they have spoiled mood completely.",
The free app works but is too basic. Upgrading to the full features (with little detail on what these are) costs $30 PER YEAR. Insane pricing for a to do list. Only a complete budgetary idiot would load up on app subscriptions that steep.,
Awesome app. Would give 5 stars if: Capability to add lists outside of Inbox for items that are processed and organized within my contexts (I use labels for these). That way inbox is just for new to-dos fresh out of my head with no processing only. Using projects for this is a work around.,
Thank you so much for this app. This app helps me so much in doing my everyday tasks because I'm so forgetful about what I should do the next day and this app is so easy to add task that I don't feel complicated when I need to add a task quickly. The home widget button is also pretty and easy to use still. Doing daily/weekly/monthly task is so easy. The shortcuts really helped me.,
I cannot live without this app! It's the first and only list making app I have been able to actually use and ditch paper. It is rich in easy to use features and I love that it syncs everywhere. Super well done and never any glitches.,
"Great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw. Every time I create a task, it goes to the bottom of the list. I always want the task at the top so I can see it. That's the whole point of using a to do list. So I have to drag the task, one by one to the top. Makes me crazy.",
"I like using the app, but unfortunately it crashes every time i reschedule large amount of tasks at the same time. (I had 170 tasks yesterday and i did only 70. Today i woke up and rescheduled the 100 from yesterday and it crashes) There's no such issue when i do it through the web version.",
"This app is so clunky to use and the premium fees would be a complete ripoff. So bad I tried another by Pocket Brilliance. Huge improvement, even w the free version and paid is more reasonable. Steer clear of this one, just a ploy to force you to upgrade to premium. Free version doesnt even let u see completed tasks older than a week. Just one example of many where they fall short here or try to force premium sales.",
"I have found this app very helpful for keeping track of deadlines in university and staying on top of responsibilities outside of school. I would suggest adding the option to configure what time the day resets. For example, I like to write out tasks for the next day before I go to bed, which may be after 12 am. Adding this feature would prevent accidentally schdeduling tasks a day later than intended.",
Conatant sync problems. Throwing errors when trying to view activity log. Not all actions of collaborators are logged. For example collaborator completed a task and it doesn't show in notifications. But sometimes it does. All in all very unpredictable app.,
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.,
In the last few weeks I can't see any of the font unless I put in dark mode. If I click on the name of the item it just pops up and disappears right away. I didn't see any updates but not sure what changed it's not very useful anymore. Issue resolved.,
"I'm impressed by the clean interface and straightforward approach - it has exactly the features you need for TODOs without bloat, complication, or distraction. The price point also works for me ($3/mo if purchased annually; no additional charge for my wife to access my projects on her device).",
"After using this product for a month on the computer and my phone, I have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with. The free option isn't as good as other options such as Microsoft To Do and the paid solution offers little more than these either.",
"I didn't get even the access to add lables and reminder which done for free by many others. I look forward for doist to include at least lables and reminders with the free plan. I really loved but without the mentioned features in the free plan, I don't want to make it my to do list app.",
prevuously I would have given this app 1000 stars... I love this app but it just updated and now the widget isn't functional.. I've been using this app for years and never had a problem.. I'm very sad about this.. This app has been so beneficial to me and having the widget made my life easier and was a good reminder that I had stuff to do.. now I have to rewire my brain to actually open the app instead of just seeing it on my home screen... Also the view all isn't working for me.. ☹️🫤,
"Todoist is the cornerstone of my organizational system. I am an undergraduate student and use this app to manage my reading assignments, exam schedule, administrative deadlines etc. sync with windows 10 desktop app is awesome. I am a free user and would gladly pay a one time price for full features here but a monthly subscription is a turn off.",
Great app. Use it basically every day. Would love if there was a way to 'select all' items on your list when your on your phone. Gets a bit annoying having to select each item one by one when you want to make batch edits.,
"An incredibly robust task list app. I love the natural language dates. It makes entering tasks super easy. I use it in conjunction with the desktop app. One thing I'd like to see imoroved is the subtask handling. Overall, its great",
"New update ""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Who the hell thought this was a good idea?? Why have you removed a feature people use?? You have made your app far more inconvenient, especially your widget. Please restore this feature. I have been an avid supporter of your app for well over 2 years, recommending it to everyone I know. This is a very disappointing decision.",
"After years of using many different checklist apps, Todoist remains my favourite for its compatibility with the GTD method. It has just the right amount of features. I have alternated between Premium and free, and am currently a Premium user as I really wanted the Label feature.",
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used.",
"I've been using Todoist for several years. I an engineer and like efficient tools. I stumbled upon the app myself when trying out many others. Its definitely the simpliest, best layed out and easy to app I've used. I really love it. Intuitive. Also it sincs on web so I can eaisly share accross devices and computers. Highly reccommend.",
The only problem I (and as I know many others too) have with this app is that I can't see periodic tasks in upcoming days and can only see the upcoming one. This makes difficult to handle and distribute tasks considering available time. Other than that its excellent and complete.,
"So many features and sub categories to keep you organized at all times. It is the best app that I've ever used for tracking important dates. I even use it to track all my bills, and it just gives me the peace of mind that I haven't felt in a long time. ☺️",
"This app is perfect for my personal task management. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I like how easy it is to quick add tasks, schedule, and how I can integrate with Gcal. Every idea I have to do anything goes in here. I need reminders for everything; I even use Todoist to remind me to change the sheets :)",
"This app has served me well for a long time, I love it, but its free version is missing one crucial feature for forgetful people like me: Reminders. It's hard to part ways Todoist, but I keep forgetting to do things lately. I'm gonna have to find another task app!",
"Great app that helps me get organized! I love the different projects I can create, plus the inbox and option to set a due date. This has helped me get more done and not lose things like I was before with one long list.",
Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.,
"Downloaded the app several months ago. Was a bit confused at first. Tried again a couple of weeks ago, am now incorporating the app in my daily task toolbox. It's pretty awesome so far! Now I just need to clone myself, and it would be nice if a pocket sized task demon would come give me a slap when I get distracted! 👹 😅",
"I hope the ""completed task"" can be still seen on the list. I also hope new feature will be added: a journal, a habit tracker (literal) and a note-taking feature. Overall, it is a neat app.",
"This app is changing my life. I know it sounds dramatic, but for someone who grew up playing video games (specifically RPG, MMOs, or any other form of roleplaying) this is all sorts of up my alley. I would absolutely recommend this app to any one looking for a great to do app. It's worth the money, especially when you know you spend it elsewhere.",
Just starting to use this. One instant improvement .. the two cogs on the profile and productivity overview LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME. They're also in virtually the same place ... So my brain tells me they'll trigger the same thing. The fact they don't is super confusing. Change one of the icons to something different. I'd be willing to bet you'll get better usage metrics.,
"Wow... A To Do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring. I won't lie, I am absolutely baffled that this is omitted. Maybe it's in the web version, or the iOS version, but I'll never know... You tick a date in the calendar and... Where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx'? Maybe it's a premium feature, I guess I'll never know that either...",
"Very useful for me. Appreciate being able to create projects that I can export/import, but wish I could create recurring tasks as well. I use to keep organized between work and home, and switch between the app and desktop.",
"Arguably the best get-things-done app/online service out there. it runs on every screen, is quick and easy to jot down an idea or task, and is easy to review/ edit. Brain dump - organize - assign - calendarise - complete - celebrate I highly recommend.",
"Some features are not available unless you upgrade, but I'm still testing out the service and not sure I'll need those features. The upgrade is not expensive and the service is pretty slick overall.",
"I'm trying to find the right program to use, not only to get organized but to stay focused on what's important to my business. Todist works great and integrates with other applications I'm using like Trello. I upgraded to premium and will continue to explore and grow using Todist.",
"I'm loving this app. The web browser version is equally amazing since you don't have to go find a bunch of buttons to press to make repeating tasks and can just type ""everyday at 2 pm"" and it very intelligently sets up the reminder for you.",
"Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY.",
"Absolutely essential. I use todoist every single day to keep things organized. The app offers lots of flexibility and an intuitive UX. I have an IFTTT automation that makes my calendar events ibto todoist items, which makes it even more useful.",
Best To Do List App I've ever used. Had multiple other To Do List Apps installed to test which work best for me and this app come out on top. Highly recommended to anyone searching for To Do List options. Even without the premium version this app is ahead brilliant. Nothing is unnecessary complicated and the ability to set daily/weekly goals truly pushes me to get more done.,
"Useful but flawed - biggest issue for me is adding subtasks to recurring tasks. If I mark the subtasks done in January, they are still marked as done when the main task comes around again in Feb. Having checked the help centre, this appears to be intended functionality and can be worked around, but it's really not practical to do so when you have a lot of subtasks",
"This app has helped me become much more organized in my work life. As a construction project manager I value the ability to quickly add the many different tasks and to do items I have from any work station or my phone. Easy to use, plenty of ways to use it well.",
"2022-07J-13th - Over a year later, still using & still a solid 5 stars. I also take back my previous remark concerning being able to set a reoccurrence by typing it. It is incredibly handy. 2021-06J-25th - So far, so good. The ability to set a reoccurrence by typing it in is clever, but less useful than I suspect the developers think it is. I'd rather have a field to pick from. At the moment it seems to have all the functionality I'm after. 2021-06J-24th - Installed & evaluating.",
"I have tried every todo app in play store and this is the best. I am managing an entire project and solely depend on todoist for everything. My only suggestion is, please sort the tasks by priority as default, so even if i add a new task let it get added to its priority order, or else a top priority work i recently added will go unnoticed at the bottom of the list.",
Grate app for people that like lists and bulletpoints for daily tasks and long term goals. Not much I can say in terms of cons. Except it's kinda annoying when it automatically converts associated letters to weekdays and schedules task for that day. Aside from that cool app.,
A nice little app. Liked most aspects of it... But had to uninstall because of just one feature - reminder. I dont know why would someone decide to ship this very basic feature as a premium one! If an app like this reminds me after two days in an email that I have overdue tasks than there is absolutely no purpose of using such an app.,
"I use the free version. There's good integration with Google calendar. I make use of recurring tasks, projects and subtasks. Would be nice if the duration was an attribute of the tall that can be modified",
Great task managing tool. But I looked it better before the update. I used to be able to see all the sub-project when I select the mother project. That makes it easier for me to manage my teams. I wish it at least gives us the option to view those or not.,
"I liked a lot this app, the only problem I'm having os that I don't get any reminder or notification, even though I marked accordingly on settings. I wouldn't mind to pay for the app with I was sure that if with the paid version that would change. That's the only reason I'm looking for another app.",
"I think Todoist is the best ToDo app out there. The free version is pretty awesome by itself, it contains no ads whatsoever. I've recently started using the premium version and I find it perfect. Also the Doist team is very friendly, they answer to all questions via Twitter.",
"after being a dedicated user of a different productivity app for many years i made the change and am now kicking myself for not doing it sooner. I'm already achieving a lot more than i ever did. Constant updates, excellent support files, cross platform. No brainer really.",
"Great app, love it. The downside is they charge 4 euro a MONTH for the optional use of the alarm on the reminder, which is crazy expensive. 48 euro a year and you don't even own the app for that. Not wise charging that much during a pandemic so that's why I'm deducting a star.",
"Easy to use, Nice UI, Dark mode, Active development, Free and Paid, Free offers very nice amount of features, Multi platforms, Syncs, Very helpful for people looking to create a routine, need structure, or just simply to keep a grocery list. I use extensively and love it, plus you can invite and give permissions to others you collab with, like Mamabear ☹️, she can't help her self with just loading it up. 🤦🏼",
"I live my life by Todoist! The iphone and Apple desktop apps are great, but I would really like to see an improved desktop app for Chromebooks. The interface is designed for Androids, which makes it clunky and inefficient on a Chromebook.",
"The app is kinda glitchy. My list has lots of tasks that are sub-tasks under a main task. When I press the carrot to expand/collapse a main task, it expands the list, but displays everthing twice. I have to press the carrot again for the list to display correctly.",
This app is easy to use and very helpful; especially since I difficulties in remembering. It reminds me of tasks I didn't complete and I can move unfinished tasks to another day without retyping it. This app has simplified my life. Thank you,
"An extraordinary, life changing, app. There are several excellent YouTube videos on how to really maximize the app under GTD type systems. I use three ""time based"" projects-- This week; Next week; Next month. Additionally, I tag things as ""Today"" when appropriate. Also super important is forwarding emails to my inbox and syncing google calendar. No kidding-- this app changed my life.",
"Recent versions drain battery like crazy Upd: sorry, this message was kept from previous review (with less stars), it looks like you fixed this issue. Currently the only unresolved need - is how to hide irrelevant task until specific time of day (like Snooze in GMail). When I set specific Due Time for task, it always appears above all others for current day, it is quite the opposite of what is expected.",
"It seems a bit complicated, at first, but once you start setting up tasks and projects, the utility becomes more apparent. I went ahead and bought premium. It's not that much and probably worth it for the reminder feature.",
Poor program. Installed it and on first start asked for email or google start up. Clicked on email address linked to phone's account. Waiting and wheel spin for 30 minutes without anything happening. Had to shut down via Close All in Recents. Tried it twice. Recommend other users not to install it. Uninstalled it.,
"Phenomenal organization & deep intuited interface. Love the ability to stream-of-thought tasks in via abstract language. Swipes and movement interfaces really play to the strengths of the mobile platform. Shame the premium features are a subscription. I would spring some $10-20 one time, but I despise subscriptions.",
"Ridiculously stupid user interface. Eg. I could not figure out why the tasks I was drafting would disappear mid-air when I tried adding a reminder. Today, I finally realised that if I set a reminder for a task, I have to use the back button of my phone to be able to go back to the menu where I was writing the task and complete it. However, if I use the back arrow button in the app, it erases the task I was writing with no warning. Makes no sense at all. Would not recommend.",
Very robust to-do app. I love the ability to collaborate and work on to-do items without finalizing or finishing that item. Also has various ways to organize to-do items to make it very organized and neat.,
"There are glitches in the Android app that aren't in the web app. (I love the web app) Would give this 5 stars if Todoist fixed them, and introduce a bug reporting feature so that bugs like these don't remain unfixed. Dragging subtasks is often glitchy and doesn't parent under the correct parent task, or just reorders back to original placement after I drag it to a parent task. The @ and # symbol rarely actually pops up with label auto recognition as I type like it does on the web app.",
"Let me keep this simple, I paid for a year. Then tried to find something cheaper. Spent a year trying out various task apps. Have now returned to Todoist, bit the bullet and paid £35. The free version suits most people but I wanted the extras.",
"While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.",
"Paid version probably is good, but.... free version is seriously restricted. Does not live up to reviews, which I am now guessing are mostly premium users. A simple example, reminders cost. 4 colors included, but a simple other one costs. Etc",
"Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!",
"Wunderlist was better. They've ruined what was a great simple list app. It annoyingly emails you to tell you things each day that you havnt done, I was. using it as a shopping list!!! So Iv deleted my account, uninstalled it and gone back to Google notes. Shame, this is what happens when conpanies buy good independent apps and then stuff them up",
"The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated.",
"ive used it personally for 2 years. fantastic app works on my iPad, android and windows 10 machines and has a handy chrome extension. seriously has helped me stay organized and even become more disciplined with my time. cannot say enough good things. 12/10 would recommend.",
"I very rarely rate apps but I just have to show my appreciation for this app - it's fantastic. The recurring tasks are a great way for me to keep calm and not have to remember all the small things I need to do every day in my head. It's so easy to use and having it as a widget for a daily to do list is so helpful. Amazing job, developers! :)",
"I really like this app. The fact that there is no way to set the calendar display either as a widget or as the first thing that opens when you click on the app, really impedes my use of the app. If I could set the calendar as the first thing that popped up when I click on the app, I would be the happiest camper.",
"The developers understand the ""stay out of the way"" concept and it makes this a really great tool. Bonus points for the unified cross-platform experience and integration with Spark, very cool! Would live to see text labels added inside the swipe action so you know what you are about to do.",
"It took me a few tries to really implement this app. I have always loved Todoist, but I didn't have enough going on in my life to put an app like this to good use. Lately though, I've needed to organize several personal projects as well as tasks for work, doctor appointments, etc. So I turned back to Todoist. It's only gotten better... I will continue to use it daily! :))",
"Todoist is the best personal calendar and TODO list I have ever seen. It is also great for Shopping lists, reminders, appointment tracking, etc. It is especially useful if you want to see it on multiple devices.",
This has really been helpful. Having the extension on my chrome browser connect to the app on my phone is very convenient. easy to keep track of my assignments I need to do. It automatically syncs between the two.,
"Great app. Very useful and anyone in the team can input things to be done, sign dates, times and team member responsible. Lacking the ability to assign multiple people to a task rather than just one person, but that may be because I'm using the free version.",
"Working well so far, im using free version and it has many features that are helping me to stay organized. The multiple projects and levels of tasks (parent/child) are handy way to organize further. I am working three prat time jobs that i have to manage my tasks and time myself, and this app os helping a bunch!",
"I loved the widget but they removed a very useful feature: to be able to open the app from the widget. It's not possible to reorganize tasks from the widget, the only way is through the app. However now it has become bothering to open the app. I hope they will bring this feature back",
"After using every single famous to do app out there, in fact after creating my own webapp. I found the best thing out there. Pros: 1. Extensions, Add-ons: There is an add-on for everything under the sun. Extension for chrome, extension for opera, add-on for gmail, heck add-on for outlook as well. 2. The regex feature of adding deadline by just typing ""next Wednesday"" Super cool. 3. Ability to add repeating task like ""read a random chapter from Statistics by Kirk every six days from next Fri"" !",
"I like it okay, so far. But I'm flabbergasted at one behavior. I entered the task ""Do house clean this early evening"". Todoist DELETED the words ""this early evening"" and arbitrarily scheduled a time. I didn't want that. I tried to read-add the text, but it kept deleting it and scheduling the job for 7 pm. The only way I could have time information remain in the task name was to misspell it! I changed ""early evening"" to ""earli evening"". It worked, but it's ridiculous.",
Great app! I get more done in my day. It helps me remember things that I need to do during my day that I usually forget about. I get to focus on one thing at a time vs feeling overwhelmed. I purchased the premium version and I think it is worth it. I can even assign a task to a someone who is collaborating with me in a project.,
"So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day.",
"I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?",
"Horrible. I have MS and bad memory issues so was hoping this would help keep me on task. Put about 15 tasks in, didnt ""swipe"" to complete, but they disappeared and were marked as complete. Couldnt see them again unless I get Premium version!",
"This is the only to do app that I've kept up working with for so long. So, it's really handful for someone who's not accustomed to ""to-do lists"". However, there's a minor problem to it: when you put a colon in front of a task, you can't mark it as done anymore. I'd be happy to see it fixed up in the next updates.",
"Please allow more complexity in setting recurring tasks for example daily routine go to bed at 10pm ev weekday and go to bed at 12am ev fri, sun. It's frustrating having to create multiple tasks for the same recurring task just because I want it set to a different time. Will leave my review at 1 star and upgrade to 5 once fixed. Look forward to any updates from Devs on this one.",
have been using the app since my undergraduate days in college. I wish there was an audio feedback while ticking the checklists in the task just like in wunderlist. There's a need of more integrations special with Microsoft business account.,
"This app is my best bud! I've been using this app for almost a year now and I'm very satisfied. However, there is a lit bit issue in using the Todoist widget, I can't directly open my todo's from the widget sooo I had to go open the app instead. Though, it's not a big issue for me but I hope this can be solve hihi. (but maybe my phone is the problem?) Anyways, Keep up the Good work!✋",
I've never been very organized and todo lists often go blank. Todoist is easy enough that making a list doesn't feel like a burden or a waste of time. I've been using it for about 3mo now consistently.,
it would be incredible if we could set up when our day ends instead of auto reset at midnight. For those of us who stay up late it would help tremendously with the gamification of the app. Thats why i put 4 stars. Thank you for an amazing app regardless 🙏,
"The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great. Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
"Still learning how to use it, but so far so good! I like how you can set up daily, weekly, etc. tasks to be recurring so you don't have to constantly re-add them. My one complaint is that setting tasks for specific dates that aren't tomorrow or next week is a bit tricky.",
beautiful app. very simple to use but also has a lot of features. I especially love being able to subsubtask my subtasks and subsubsubtask my subtasks. the only criticism is that the reminder feature is hidden behind paywall. it would be better if only customizations were a paid features or if there was a one time paid option instead of monthly.,
Todoist has been great. But what would be great is to not be faced daily with a to do list widget that's incapacitated by a refresh circle. Never was a problem until recently. Now I'm in a spot where I would just leave the widet in its useless state because of how much I just want the widget to show me what I need without a prodding from an opened app. Looks like I'll be trying some other means that has never disappeared on me this whole time.,
"App is not for me. I paid $4.00 for 1 month of Premium service and is still shows I am using the free app. I immediately contacted customer service (twice), and it's been more than 2 weeks into the 1 month I paid for and I still have not received a response from anyone at Todoist. I'm still trying to figure out how to customize this app to suit my needs, but since I don't have the Premium app in order to do that, I will be uninstalling this app.",
"it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick.",
"This app is life changing. I'm terrible at organizing and keeping myself on track, but Todoist has changed all of that. With a little bit of habit building, I'm more organized than I've ever been and less stressed. I cannot recommend this app enough.",
"I am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks/projects I have scheduled, so I end up missing out on things I want to take care of. I have it turned on in Settings. Why is that?... I utilize the Smart Schedule tool, but still no notification. Pls help or fix.",
"Great app, now I put down every single plan which comes to my mind and there is easier to manage it and make it complete. I haven't tested premium yet, but I think it would be even more helpeful to reach the goals.",
"I thought this app was just ok, then I learned about the smart scheduling. Being able to schedule a task in for 'every Tuesday' or 'on the 25th of every month' really revolutionized my to do list. Now this app is indispensable.",
"The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you.",
"It works pretty well, particularly in shared tasks and in linking to Android Assistant. I find the interface to not be as i would like, but that might just be me not knowing how to use it the most efficiently.",
"The UX for this app is way beyond similar apps like Google keep and one note. The user interface is also very intuitive. the organization system is also to an extent is manipulable to the users need, which is fantastic. really well designed",
"It looks like it will run smoothly with helpful features, and I like how clean and simple UI is. I'm a bit disappointed I won't get reminders without Pro though? I'm worried this app will be near useless for my goldfish memory if I don't pay for the membership. :/ Am I missing something?",
"This app is changing my life! I started slow but once you get going it's almost addictive and karma points for completing tasks on time were a real nice surprise. Enjoy this app alot and highly recommend it, very easy to use and convenient.",
"App is easy to use and helps me stay focused on my goals, both personal and professional. The reminders are a great bonus and syncing with Google Calendar makes it so I can track my Todoist tasks alongside the events recorded in Calendar.",
"Todoist was good enough for me, but I was a free tier user. Recently I discovered that my todo list is growing because I eventually forget things that are in the list. A feature to get reminders is behind the paywall. Todo list without a reminder? Please give reminders for free tier too, you can monitize in other ways like advanced stats etc",
"Don't know if there's a paid version, but the free one is fully functional and without any ads. It would be exactly what I need... if not for the fact that whenever I add new item or try to change order of tasks on a list, some other tasks also randomly change their place on a list. It is a dealbreaker for me, as I sort things in specific order to do them in that exact order. edit: I am talking about a bug in project view. others have the same problem from what I've gathered.",
"Maybe it works for some people, but this was absolutely the worst 'to do list' app I have tried! Every time I opened it, therr was a 'feature' blocking my use. The ultimate problem was finding no task delete function.",
"its easy to use and works across multiple platforms. you can colour code and add as many categories with the premium version. i use it for work meetings and for personal use, it has helped me manage numerous projects so far! highly recommended",
"I had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks, 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens. Also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk. Poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers.",
I've tried a bunch of these to-do apps. This one gives you the most for free. You can sync two devices on the free tier. Phone and laptop are enough for most people. No ads no pushy upgrade messages.,
"Intuitive UI, nothing essential is stripped away for free use. Would be 5 starr except for no calendar view for events, or any view with easy-access more than 7 days out - makes it difficult at a glance to see jf setting up a meeting a month away would conflict with, say, a Doctor's appointment.",
"This App has really transformed the way i go about my routine life. it helped me declutter and minimize daily stress.it can be improved further however by letting users reorder the day's tasks and setting deadlines to individual tasks, which offcourse require more time to be completed. it should also introduce its own calender within the app to enable users to look at their activities in a broader context.",
"Paying a monthly fee is not acceptable IMO. I would gladly pay a one time fee for it. I still use apps from years ago that are still used from one phone to the next. If I had to pay a monthly fee to keep those this whole time would be way too much for what they're worth. This is a good app, with plenty of features, but not worth $36 a year.",
"A task management system is crucial in my system so I don't forget things and Todoist fulfills all of my needs, even with a basic account. The smart auto-text recognition when typing in tasks is also very useful at reducing the time it takes for new tasks to be entered so I'm more likely to keep updating and using this system.",
I am very satisfied with this App. I does what i expected it to do including reminding about the things to do ans repeating tasks every month. I also love how it is super easy to use and even easier to type in the Task with predictive dates and stuff Overall great app!,
"This app has pretty much the best NLP system from all competitors, very easy to add new tasks quickly. One of the places it could improve is for notifications. Having quick actions for notifications (+15 min, next day, etc) would be very useful (similar to what TickTick does for notification)",
"The GREATEST personal organization app I have used. Cool and simple user experience, works on all major platforms so you can access your lists from virtually anywhere. If you are looking for a way to get organized and productive, this what you are looking for.",
"They want you to pay a premium for reminders. You gotta be kidding me. A premium membership. For a ""to do list"" app. What has this world come to. Also it has you log in with your Google account or email. I downloaded a couple other to do list apps that don't require a login, and don't require a premium membership for reminders.",
"Generally pretty good, but a lot of awkward design choices: no compact mode, inefficient use of colors for organization, difficulty selecting and moving tasks, lack of icon consistency, preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself.",
"Best task scheduling app. And I've tried many. I'm using it to break long term goals into smaller incremental goals, and to handle recurring housrhold tasks. Sadly, no task app can stop me from over-committing myself to too many tasks on a daily basis...",
"So I've cancelled the subscription and it showed me that I have premium until December 20-ish, imagine my surprise when it charged me for next month anyway. I asked support for a refund but they said it's impossible, ""but you can use our app for one more month"". Well, I didn't want to. I don't see any feature to unbind my card either, so I am afraid I need to delete account to make sure this bloody app won't charge me again against my will. For not allowing refunds and no unbind - 1 star.",
"I don't consider reminders as premium features, if you could make it as a single feature purchase I would definitely buy that. The other features are okay and the price is good, but reminders are just unnecessarily premium. Besides from being available for Linux, I don't find anything unique in Todoist that others doesn't have.",
"This app IS great, and has the potential to be greater! However, my only 2 requests is when you add a ""Parent Project"" to your ""Favorites,"" please include the projects within it as well! And to also make setting alarms to your tasks more simple, and reliable. Thanks!",
"Latest update has a bug rendering it useless - in certain projects, noticeably once marked as ""Favourites"", when tapping ""add task"", nothing happens. Huawei Honor 10. Edit: They fixed it. Thanks. Excellent app and responsive team 😁",
"Great app, using it all the time... Would be great to have a toggle for switching on and off the view of the completed tasks in ""today"" mode. This motivates even more, if you see how many things you accomplished today...",
"Spam!!!!. Trying to remove the notification on the email for the past month after uninstalling the app, and it doesn't allow me. Asking to install the app again, and it didnot work for me. How many times I need to xlick tje option to remove the notification? I get 2 emails of due tasks *EVERYDAY*, SO Annoying. =oI",
"the interface is so unintuitive. why does the ""submit"" button have an icon of a paper airplane making it look like a ""send"" button. Reschedule? I'm not rescheduling i'm actually adding the time and date for the task and so on....",
"Excellent app, in my opinion the best productivity app out there. Simple and intuitive user interface and it integrates with anything else you can think to pair it with (Google Calendar, Gmail, etc.). It's the easiest to use and most effective app I use daily.",
I use it for writing things I need to do later. I like how you can priorities items and set due dates. I also like the feature of repeating task. It is easy to use. intuitive. great way to get organised.,
Good interface. Will not sync shared projects between devices (Web and Samsung S9+). Followed all troubleshooting steps provided on website. Syncs correctly when using web interface. Good app for those who are using the web interface.,
"The app is very good, but after the change in scheduling settings the feature is not convenient at all. Each time I need to schedule the task to a certain time - it's a torture.",
"its pretty good, very functional. a cool widget that makes it easy to see your tasks. i wish i could opt out of the emails. and i wish they had a set up for late tasks that was less anxiety indusing. it has a good grouping feture, and a good repeating task feture",
"Worth paying for premium. This app helped me organize my life and breaks down big scary projects into simple tasks. The interface is a little confusing at first, but when you learn it, its extremely helpful. Cant recommend this app enough",
"Useful app. Easy to use and handy. EXCEPT - the Todoist calendar only shows the NEXT occurence of a recurring task, not ALL recurrences. This is a recipe for a scheduling conflict, and big omission for an app like this.",
Makes keeping track of everything so much easier! Worth the subscription. I love that I can capture things I need to do in seconds - then later come back and figure out where those things fit in my overall plan.,
I am very impressed with Todoist. I've been using Google Tasks which was nowhere near as flexible. Being able to organize across projects with priorities and easy rescheduling makes this app very effective at helping me stay organized.,
"An awesome way to get organized, STAY organized, and feel like you actually accomplished something with your day! It's easy to use, has boatloads of useful features, and has honestly improved my productivity so very much. Would 100% recommend!",
"Seems like a really good app but just did not suit my needs. As someone with adhd, reminders are essential and to have them locked behind a pay wall is just quite useless. Without reminders I don't even remember to open the app throughout the day. But still a very good app, just not quite for me.",
"It took me 2 days to notice the ""show completed tasks"" command. Until then I couldn't see how to use this app as a Journal (I.e. looking into the past), not just a planning tool, and had started looking for another app that would do both. To use this app as a diary, you type your diary entry as the name of a new task, assign it to Today (so that it will be displayed with the date) in a special project e.g. ""Diary"" (can only be done before the task is completed) and click the box to complete it.",
"Great for organizing and planning your tasks. Also the app is very responsive, even on an older phone. No wait time, no frustration, just add tasks within seconds, right from your phone's home screen",
"needs a dedicated habit tracking tab, one where you can see your history. Unlike a task, it would be nice to see a habit tracking history. Besides this, one of the best productivity apps out there. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾",
Super app... Can keep tracks of different types of lists really well... Just one thing I wish they had the slide and add more things in a section even in the today tomorrow next week lists It would make the process faster Than choosing the date in the calender again n again.,
Amazing. It feels really premium and polished even for the free version and they don't make it so core functionality needs to be paid for. I have been using it for years and would make this the must download app for everyone.,
"This app is AWESOME! I love how convenient it is to setup quick projects and tasks. i do wish we could share more than projects. I want to make and share a simple grocery list, having to make a ""Project"" list for that seems silly, buuuuut thats just verbage. love it, thank you for the wonderful app!",
"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools.",
"There is an issue in this app where comments dont show up on mobile app but you can see it on desktop or web. I have to logout from the app for the comments to appear. This happens every now and then. When it happens, I just need to logout and login but I find that inconvenient. Pls fix.",
Been using the free version for a few days. Very good functionality. Was previously using Google keep. The ability to divide tasks by project and the ability to assign priorities are clear improvements.,
"Excellent way to keep organized. More features in the free tier and better customer service than competitors. As soon as they implement automatic dark mode, it will be everything I could ask for.",
"I've put all the productivity apps through their paces and ToDoist is the clear winner for me. Its biggest strength is it's ability to be adapted to many different workflows and ways of thinking. Too many other apps seem limited in that domain. Currently it works very well as part of the GTD system for me. Highly recommend premium, especially for a GTD setup.",
"OK so I have tried a few and this looks to be a well rounded feature rich app that probably does everything I want it to do. I easily integrated it to my Trello board via a power up, nice. Ok so lets set a reminder for my first task! Seriously, reminders are Pro only pffff. Laters.",
"been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better. it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context, add a label and move to a different project.",
"So far enjoying the app. Only complaint is that in Board view, if you swipe up/down just a few degrees from vertical it interprets it as a horizontal swipe. Not a deal breaker, just annoying. Thanks!",
"As a digital product designer I especially find the user experience on this app phonemenal, everything I think of every feature, how it works, where it's placed is exactly the way I want it to be and this only tells you that the user testing team did their job and conducted their interviews. This app is a blessing to have, an app that states boldly the outcome when all parts involved do it right. Just an admirable piece of user experience I fortunately get to use everyday.",
"Integrates nicely with web version. Some of the tagging and organization is more intuitive in a browser, but it's still a great little to do list app. I love how effective the repeat scheduling features are.",
Have used Todoist over many other organizers for quite a while now. Current version has a bug that prevents me from turning off the morning reminder so I've had to disable all notifications. The free version limit on boards coming out of nowhere was pretty awful too.,
"I've been using this app for three years and it has changed my life. At a certain level they could create more milestones for goals achieved and hope they keep building this, but for now it's what I recommend often for anyone trying to get more disciplined at their 🥅.",
"Fits GTD model like a glove. Simple, easy to use, functional, multiplatform, intuitive gem of an application. The only thing I would add is geo-tagging of tasks for location based notifications. EDIT: just realized geo tagging is here as well. 😂",
"This was really good until the app just stopped working. You'd start the app and just get a black black page, ending up with warning message after warning message saying that the app had stopped working. Tried restarting the app and the phone and the message wouldn't stop appearing.",
"Great app! I have an issue with updating a widget on homescreen. The days in ""coming"" mode didn't update until I tap on some of the tasks. Previously, everything was updated without problems and unnecessary interactions.",
"This is the best to-do app I've tried. I love being able to organize my tasks into color-coded folders. It works great both on mobile and desktop. The reminder function is well worth paying for, and the cost is very reasonable.",
"Spent about 5h on creating tasks. Verified before closing, everything was there, was nicely saved. The next day I discover that there are no tasks ... Just 5h of working in vain. And the interesting thing, there is nothing in trash or in history as well. Horrible app",
"I really like the app and how easy it is to organize projects. The only thing I would want added is that tasks due on a specific day can be seen on the calendar when picking due dates for tasks, instead of just their colour code.",
"I was never satisfied with any ToDo app. I always wanted something which was missing. I don't know what it was but it wasn't satisfying. But this changed the game. ToDoist is by far the best task management app, I have ever used. The way it is designed gives very satisfying experience. I am 100% satisfied with the product.",
"Todoist has been improving I would love to see an optimization of the ""Share"" image as comment. It has bugs and fails regularly. Example : When saving a screenshot to a project on Android. I usually recieve a notification saying that it failed.",
Very flexible interference that can fit almost everyone. I highly recommend everyone who have anything that he needs to do to use this app as you can diverge and manage your things very easily with this app very easy to understand but also extremely powerful tool of filters if you're a pro user,
"This is a really helpful app for personal use. I like just having basic to do lists for each day. I would like a better calendar view though, so I could use it instead of Google calendar. I am trying to build habits and routines, and this app is good for setting recurring tasks.",
Easy to use and effective. I have become more productive ever since I began using it. Access to my list on my phone or computer proves very useful especially at times when my phone was unavailable. Highly recommend to anyone trying to create structure in their lives.,
"My personal favorite task manager. Natural language has a bit of a learning curve, so if there is a feature you expected it is likely accessible via the natural language task input. A dark theme and cross-platform features also elevate it above the competition.",
I'm disabled so detailed planning and recording tasks is vital! Tried many apps and like Todoist enough for day to day I got Pro. + Sync with GCal [Home + Gmail] + Fairly easy to use + Cross platform - subtasks (STs) that recur. e.g.  'Accounts' has 8 STs. If STs set to recur ALL of them show up in GCal (month view) but if not I must add them every time (or do/undo which breaks my task count). - no journal option - complicated export - can't mark tasks as done on previous day,
"Great app! Easily share lists with others. Easy to add or check off items. One enhancement request would be to make another default view option the list of all projects, rather than having to choose one project to default view.",
"New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise.",
"I've tried multiple Productivity apps and the learning curve has always been pretty steep. Not so much with Todoist! A smooth UI and lots of , but not too much, functionality. Great work developers",
"Amazing app, clean layout, no ads. Helps me put my thoughts onto a list and get things done. Have recommended to family and friends when I hear they're still using pen and paper. Love the cross platform support. App available on all platforms, even Linux.",
Super simple but lifesaving app. I don't really like using phone calendars to plan out my day because there are too many useless features and it takes very long to set everything up. But when I downloaded Todoist I started planning everything.,
"Todoist is garbage. Nevermind the idiotic text-based method for creating daily tasks, this stupid app seems to think ""every day"" is a suggestion, even with Premium. Been using this app for three weeks & every few days, it refuses to renew my daily tasks. Scheduled reminders disappear. Curse & blast whoever EOL'd Wunderlist cuz it was perfect for my needs. This todoist trash? Not at all. I will cling to Wunderlist until the very end.",
"I've never paid for a productivity app until I started using Todoist. It is THE BEST task management app out there. Simple, clean, beautifully designed, easy to use, and packed with features. Definitely recommend it.",
Lots of great features while remaining simple and easy to use. Works great across platforms. I love the new update it added features and tightened up the UI without making arbitrary changes or feeling bloated.,
Great App! being able to track down and see the tasks you've accomplished is so great! that's why I really love it 'coz its make me more productive. But I was hoping you can add the Pomodoro technique to make users more productive and will be able to track how much time will we spent on a task.,
"As a genius, it was one of the most useful apps I've ever used in my entire life! Everything is pretty simple; complicated things are also made of a lot of simple parts; and this app allowed me to manage my complicated tasks! Just imagine you could manage a huge marriage ceremony just by using this app, thinking! Or an essay, a school project, plan for a journey, your goals, your dates and everything! This app just made me wondered! And I'm really speechless for more! It's a masterpiece! 👍🙏😇",
"Favorite to do list let! It is cross platform, cloud based, and there are short cuts for everything so my to dos can get easily organized at the task or project level and cover both timing and priority needs. Love this service!",
"12 hours, just 12 hours I had this app. Received 6 emails for todoist. Why do you think it is acceptable to bombard me with email? On top of the email issue, to make any real use of this app you have to sign up for the premium service. Wont be coming back. Uninstalled and you been added to my junk email list. Pathetic!",
"The most intuitive & simple function is to be able set tasks. Create the task w a description, then choose the frequency & specific days. I can't create a simple daily task for Monday through Friday without creating a weekly task for each of those 5 days. An app lacking that simple function creating more work for the user is one I can't get behind using. Nothing in help section resolved this most basic issue. If that capability exists its impossible to find. 30 minutes & I'm giving up.",
"Been loving it so far until recent update, I don't get the ""UNDO"" prompter anymore when I ""accidentally"" completed a task! SUGGESTION: Can we have a ""Recently Completed Tasks"" in the Navigation Menu please? (I believe this is consistent with many input by other reviewers/users/customers ~.^) 1 week's worth of it is good enough. Thank you!",
"the interface is easy and very slick. helps me and getting things done. rescheduling a task as a breeze. changing priority or sequence of tasks for the day is also very easy, just a drag and shift.",
"Very easy to use, and does the things I want it to. It's worth learning the text entry shortcuts for things like due date and project. I also find the premium features to be worth having.",
"Todoist Allows you to carefully plan your activities and be accountable for their completion. Also, if you remember an undone chore, you can quickly put it into the app and the likelihood of you doing that thing tripples.",
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer.",
"Good App. Make it better still. We need: 1. Recurrent task/reminders. Need to set a daily or weekly reminder for a task, not just a deadline or completion date. Also it would allow to set a reminder for regular daily routines (exercise, meditation, language' etc) 2. WhatsApp integration. The reminders appear as Whatsapp message (optional). Many people still use WhatsApp for projects ans business. 3. Alternatively, Share options to distribute tasks by email, whatsapp, etc",
"Please, make the widget minimalistic like in com.stuff.todo. upd: new widgets are far better than b4. looking forward for the ability 2 chnge fonts/opacity (roboto thin/condensed light = great; montserrat too). also would b great 2 have an option 2 make tags invisible + changin color accents to custom/theme aligned like red dates etc (and/or make it grab the accent from bg picture). compact view is not an option, I like the orig spacing. last 1: cut off the header, widgt cusomizes while creation",
"I love so many things about this app: the cross platform support, the responsive interface, the project segments, and the inbox organization. I use this for so many things now, and may consider subscribing the longer I use it",
"Very happy with Todoist after trying various. Easy to pick up and the nice widgets to display and quick add have very quickly become part of my routine, and stuck. Others have lacked smoothness in that area, best I've tried.",
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker.",
"Its a great app and encourages productivity. A nitpick i have with the newest update is that the ""sorted by due date"" still appears in the widget screen, and is kind of annoying. It would be nice if that is removed, thanks!",
"Great all-around app. Free features are enough for most users, though thete are some nice premium perks for upgrading. Love being able to create items using natural voice. This app is tough to beat. I keep trying other apps and always return here.",
"Simple but powerful and I can use it with Google Home! If you download the IFTTT app, you can integrate the two and add tasks to your default list or add items to your shopping list. Works on your phone by voice or on Google home. And the app itself is great.",
"I have been having a great experience with the app. I love how I make updates on my PC, and they reflect on all my other devices. So handy, and it's made me so much more productive both at work, and at home! I also really like the flexibility of the widget.",
"This isn't your mother's to do list. It has many layers and after 3 weeks I still feel as though I'm learning how to fully use it. Having said that, you can make it as simple or as detailed as you wish. I already feel more on top of things and look forward to learning how to maximize the benefits of Todoist. Use the tutorials.",
"Too Expensive. I was going to use this for managing my business and my sons education. However, I am not going to pay $8 a month per person using that app when I there are perfectly free good apps that do the same. Do not recommend. I mean honestly, it's not that complex keeping track of tasks, and I am not going to pay a subscription fee for a to do app.",
"This helps me to be so much more organized! Huge improvement over my random pieces of paper and lists all over the place. It's simple, fluid, and easy to use. (Written after one week of use.)",
"If it were a one off payment for the premium version, I'd pay it in a heartbeat, but who (apart from a very rich person) would pay £36 per year, amounting to £180 to use some extra features on a phone app for 5 years? No thanks!",
I paid for the pro and of course they make it a pain to cancel. The tasks and reminders take way too many buttons to press and it doesn't even sound an alarm or anything just a notification. I bought this because i need something better than Google calendar but its worse because you have to pay.,
Indispensible. I use this to keep both my professional and personal life organized. I find the calendar integration to be very helpful. I also sync both calendar and Todoist to the Momentum dashboard extension for Chrome.,
Very good so far! I have been playing around with this for a week and have found it useful but not annoying with reminders and access via multiple devices. really like how you can group projects too.,
"I really can't speak to the full experience, because I do not have the premium version, but so far the free version has helped me with keeping my projects and tasks in one place. I am still getting the hang of prioritizing, but that is more of a personal thing.",
"+ Simple, pretty, you can make folders, it works cross plattform which is really importany for me. - Sometimes it bothers me that it converts some text automatically into dates and it doesn't seem you can turn it off. e i wish i could just write ""thursday",
"No Reminders. After installation and setting and adding entire to do list with reminders, I missed couple of important calls. When I checked why I didn't get a reminder, app mag said reminders are only available in PRO version. Why the hell are you not mentioning these things upfront? Ohh yes, coz then people won't download this shot.",
"It was one of the best tasks/project management apps. I loved it and used a lot. Now, after last updates mobile UI become completely unusable and inconvenient for me. A lot of space used in efficient way for ugly bottom app bar :(",
"I highly recommend Todoist. Easy to add tasks and move them around as needed. Since it's on my phone and always by my side, I easily add tasks on the go by typing or by voice. Whenever I get overwhelmed with things that need to be done, I use Todoist to prioritize my day by assigning a 1, 2, 3 or 4 priority.",
"I've been using todoist with my team for while and now I have to ditch it because it has many bugs and they often don't get fixed quickly enough. Basic things like syncing often have issues for some reason, and it's very painful to use it.",
I love this app! It keeps all my projects and tasks organised and helps me to stay in control. Really easy to use and once you've set everything up it keeps you on track. Highly recommended.,
This app has been super helpful for me in organizing my tasks on a daily basis. Is there any way you can integrate a feature that shows completed tasks? It would be great for keeping track in projects or just the feeling of completion and being productive that is very rewarding for the user. Thank you!,
"I've been using Todoist for about 2 weeks now. In that time I've gone from post it notes and the apple reminders app on my phone to everything on Todoist. One of the great things for me is that I can create ""projects"" for general day to day things that need doing and I can also create ""projects"" for work tasks that need to be done. The app refreshes seemlessly on my phone when I'm ticking off my shopping list and on my desktop in the office checking off daily tasks. Big thumbs Todoist!",
Add habit track and focus mode just like in tick tick app (your competitors). Over all I like tick tick more because of these features but because that company is based in China really concerned about data protection laws. That is the only reason I will stick with todoist. Pls add gamified habit track and focus mode,
"This is a great app that has sharing of tasks and recurrence. It took me a long time to find the exact thing for what we needed for a household chores, and this is perfect! it also has great integration across multiple platforms.",
"it's hard to edit tasks because it doesn't have multi select. also hope that I can see a proper calendar in here. and I can't turn my sub tasks as a main task and vise versa. Edit: I see, I couldn't multi-select because I was trying to hold the task to select it. But the subtasks in projects, they're all nested inside the main task, I can't move them. I can change the subtasks in the inbox tho.",
"Simple & Sweet. No unnecessary clutter - just things I need to do, organised by category and date. Slick interface and cool date parsing are highlights. Can also integrate with Google Home but I didnt find much use for that.",
"I have been using this app for a few weeks, and it has been a tremendous help in making me organized and less stressed. I love the user interface. I can create a task, set its due date, its priority, and its category (project) all from the keyboard. However, I wish that I could look farther ahead than 7 days. When I schedule a task to a day two weeks from now, I want to see what specific things I have going on that day (not just how many tasks) so that I can make sure that I can do it then.",
"I've been enjoying the app. I love how I can easily set recurring tasks. There's just one thing I wish I could change. I wish I could change the hour at which a new day begins. I know that sounds weird, but I am a night owl and usually don't go to bed until after midnight. Before I settle down for the night, I like to review my day and check off tasks that I forgot to check off earlier. But by the time I do that, it is technically a new day and the tasks are automatically marked overdue.",
Awesome app. Best of all the apps I've used. Just one suggestion- please add a feature that allows the user to add an image like a cover image for each project. It would look more good aesthetically.,
"App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features.",
greaaaaaat app. Should support more languages for shortcuts and make icons instead of colours for projects (or make both options possible). Reminders would be great to have for free and monthly payments are a bit too much for me... a one time payment would be best,
"Some functions are frustrating. I was trying to enter tasks as theyre described in an assignment with things like part a, b, or c, but it always changed anything with a part ""a"" to a time. If I manually changed it so there was no time, it deleted the rest of the text.",
"Makes a less-than-good first impression on new users by makng word input as scheduling as cryptic as possible and having no undo for marking things done, or way of looking up what you accidentally marked as done. A pain in the neck in many ways.",
"This app is amazing! 💕 Everything is much easier with this app, you can easily organize all of your tasks, and you can set schedule, reminders, even prioritize those tasks. It is very simple but helpful! 💖 Definitely my fav productivity app ever 😍",
"Today (9/19) my filters have disappeared. They are still present and functioning on my computers but not on my phone. The dev asked if I would try logging out and back in. Yesterday and again today I tried just force stopping the app, and that didn't work. Logging out and back in did work. Back to normal.",
Hands down the best task management platform ever. Use it for work and personal stuff. It's a bit dangerous as it can become a crutch: these days if it doesn't go on todoist it doesn't get done. But this is a testament to the quality of the app. Can't wait for boards!,
"thank you so much please never go away hmm suggestion though is the ability to add more than one subtasks at a time. every time i add one, i had to select the task every single time. so that would be really useful, if that feature is already there too and i just didnt know about it, i apologize.",
Great app across multiple platforms. my only quibble is I have to turn the smart date function on and off as it's not very totally reliable. I would like to be able to the smart date function on and off as needed in each task,
Definitely needs a way to have a daily to-do list. Add a feature where I can put items like 'make bed' and 'meditate' as daily tasks and not have to type them in everyday and it's a 5 star app. Just looking for a way to open the app and start chocking daily tasks off without making a long list everyday over and over.,
Good but I must activate the pro version to get a lot of features. The free version does not make it easy to use because it makes no distinction between freemium and paid features in the UI.,
This is a great and simple app to organize tasks and projects. If there was one area that could use improvement it would be the need to visualize tasks in a in-app calendar or gantt view.,
"This is one of those amazing, rare apps, that I had to leave a review for. It has pretty much everything I could think of, presented in a very sleek design with customisable widgets. Just download it and see for yourself!",
"Todoist has always been useful whenever I purposefully open the app. It is only now when I ""explored"" a bit and figured how I could simply add it to my notification panel or even highlight and share a word and immediately export it to the app is when I realized how convenient it really is 😁. What can I say, I'm a noob with technology lol",
Forced to update the app only to be charged for labels. Stop charging for things that used to be free. The app barely does anything with the free version. It's getting to the point that the default notes app in your phone is more competent than this app,
"Have been using the app for several years now, just love the simple interface, and most importantly the reliability of the app and synchronization across platforms. Highly recommended",
"Very nice app that helps you organize your tasks and time. Links with Google calendar for the best experience. Has a pro version with a monthly payment, but is still very useful without.",
"Good functionally but slow app. The widget almost never updates, and the app itself lags heavily on ticking off items. This didn't used to be the case but is also true for the Windows app to now. Unless this is improved I doubt I'll be resubbing.",
I've tried a few to do list apps and this is the best by far. The amount of features you get is fantastic. Homescreen widget is the icing on the cake along with cross platform support with Linux!,
"Numerous bugs exist. The main one affecting me is once you've added a task, it is impossible to amend it as the changes you make will not be saved. Try to change a one-off task due today into a repeating daily task, it recognises the modification by changing the font, but then you click save and nothing happens.",
"Irritating. Can't say more than one word for your list, goats cheese comes up as goats. No more than 3 items per list on the ""board"" I deleted my tasks before adding sub items by tapping them. Monday board is easier to use than this, with videos to show you how to do it on youtube.",
"I've tried a ton of different ""to do"" apps, planners, calendars, etc...and this is one of my favorites because it's clean, easy to understand, doesn't have tons of extra things going on - it sticks to what you need instead of trying to jam pack everything into one app - and it's extremely affordable for the premium version....which is, in my opinion, a must have.",
"using the free todoist account with the app. the app works great, provides a nice clean interface and is for the most part doing exactly what it should. would recommend as a todo app, it even has a nice widget to use on your home screen",
"incredible app. feature suggestion: a swipe-enabled task tracker feature (swipe to open on-screen list) like Xiaomi's ""Quick Notes"" feature. tried switching to their app just for that feature, but it just wasn't as sophisticated as Todoist.",
This is the most extremely useful tool I've found in my third month of my first ever semester in college. It really pushes me to the tasks I need to do. It is very helpful. I use this in both my phone and laptop. I highly recommend this app especially to college students. Thank you devs for making such an outstanding program! 😀😀😀,
Its a great app and functionality is great BUT only when it works. Lately its been crashing regularly and using it has been a struggle to the point where its unusable. I'll edit my review once this persistent crashing issue is sorted.,
Nice and intuitive interface. Items/tasks are synced across devices. Great solution for organizing and filtering items. Also optional reminders are possible for more important items. No issues/bugs after 2 months of usage. Easy 5/5!,
"I am over the moon elated and happy with this app. I had to leave, more or less, another app that I had jury-rigged to accomplish To Do management. I'm glad that happened because it forced me to investigate apps like Todoist and I will not look back! Todist is simple yet exceedingly powerful. There's lots of collateral on YouTube and elsewhere in addition to the extensive help documents that come with the product to help you really customize it to your precise use case. I'm an avid, raving fan",
I have tried so many todo list applications and Todoist is my favourite todo list app and will be continued as so. Tackling daily tasks with Todoist is straightforward and easy. The integration with Google Calender is really amazing and I loved it as I were able to be more productive altoghether with Google Calender and managing tasks and todos with Todoist. Highly recommended for anyone.,
"This app came highly recommended from software dev friends. It boasts a remarkably intuitive user interface, stays in sync between desktop & mobile, and i've yet to hit any paywall bs; just simply the best to-do list application i've ever used.",
"Loving this app! To me, the best feature is the ability to break down complex tasks into smaller sub tasks, each of which can have their own due dates and priority. Makes it so much easier to make progress and complete projects. Thanks for such a great level of detail!",
I've been using it for just over a year now. it's apart of me now. thanks for upping the limit 300. breaking them up in to different projects is good and all but you lose two sync google calendar ability.,
"Keeps me on top of my tasks every day for the last 5 years. It's a great experience, works as advertised and intended, and I love the natural language features (e.g. ""Take out the trash every Mon 8pm starting Dec 1 until June 15""). One improvement would be to add duration so your integrated calendar could use this information better – because ""today at 8pm"" in Todoist is a due date but for Google or Outlook calendar is a starting time for an 1-hour event.",
"Very solid task manager, really like the natural language method of entering tasks. It has the easiest method of creating recurring tasks I have found. Integration with Google Calendar is a plus. I like the clean interface.",
"I live my life by this app. I will forget EVERY thing I need to do if Todoist doesn't remind me that I need to do it. That is why I am so frustrated lately with this app. Every day I have many, many tasks that I need to know about. It seems recently that I get MAYBE 5% of them. At the end of the day I will check Todoist on my android device (Samsung Note 20 Ultra) but when I look at the list in Todoist, there are like 30 missed tasks marked in red but I NEVER got any notification.",
"I'm experiencing bugs when using widgets. The task will disappear and I can't add on it (No tasks match the current sorting options). To fix it, I need to remove and add the widget again. I'm using ""sorted by due date"", I'm not sure if it's the same with the other sorting options. I'm using Android 11.",
"Very poor sync between app and Google Calendar. Even though udates are getting pushed from Google Calendar (i.e. showing in browser version) but not received even after 30 minutes on app version. Developer please look into this. Edit: it is working well now, i am watching you 👀 😂",
"Love this app! Todoist, can you please add a feature for me? You can put it on Pro only. I really would like to be able to adjust what time a ""new day"" starts. Sometimes I'm up past midnight and complete some daily tasks after midnight, but it messes it all up because they don't show up for the next day because technically I've already completed them that day. I'd like the app to start a ""new day"" at, say, 3am instead of midnight. Can you add that please?",
"Todoist has allowed me to outsource my brain of all the chores, errands, and reminders that were constantly taking up real estate in my thoughts. I never have to worry about when I'm going to the grocery store, when to do laundry, or when my next oik change needs to be, etc. This app has allowed me to live a more efficient and intentional life. I recommend it to anyone that will listen to me.",
Todoist is legitimately my favorite to do list app I have ever used. It's what makes me aware of everything of what's going on or what i don't. I have a suggestion though. Can ya'll add a days/hours/mins away due feature where you can keep in track of how much time a task has left until due? That'll be great!,
"I have never had to write a list as I could always remember the order of the day. Now retired, I find I have a more divergent day and have too much to do to form a coherent picture. Enter Todoist. Just put everything that occurs to you in the inbox and sort the days/weeks jobs or each morning. prioritise, label - calls, emails.., order your day and tick off as you do. Set repeats, dates and times and reminders. Takes a bit of practice and discipline but it is excellent. Like a PA!",
"Suggestion: the repetitive task are not shown in the calendar for the entire duration. It would be nice if it is visible for the full duration (in the upcoming section, and also when scheduling a new task), so we know how my upcoming weeks look like",
"reply to developer: whatsapp continues to run in background and show notifications even after being closed. why are you unable to do that? .. original comment: I paid $4 for the reminders. However, reminders work only when the application is active. If you exit / shut-down the application, no reminders for you. Developer should design the application in such a way that it continues to run in background even when user exits it. I would like to have my money back unless this problem is rectified.",
I've been using todoist for the past 3 months to organized my uni life. Not going to lie but this apps has helped a lot in staying organized and stay focus on my priorities🙌🏻 The interface is easy to adapt and use not only that it provides a lot of extension too such as Google calendar. Recommend everyone to try it out 😌👌🏻✨,
"overall great app. seeing if todoist could replace omnifocus which i have used for years. Pros - cross platform (windows, macOS, iOS, Android); Cons - can not set task durations, macOS users will that need to integrate with outlook will need some scripting to make work",
"Pretty exceptional. I wish the design choices between the mobile and the desktop platform were a little more consistent, but it's otherwise the one of the best todo-list apps out there.",
"Requires account to use.   I was just giving a simple reason why I didn't like it. But since your response indicates I don't have 10 seconds, then I'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand.  The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already.  Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that. That is what you need to understand, some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat. Downloaded ""Tasks: Todo List"" and been happy with it. Donated $1.99 to developer for making app for me and not their self.",
App is good esp. the language detection for date and time but the reminder / snooze function does not work properly. Needs to be persistent and not just move tasks to incomplete. I used a paid version. Now gone back to MS To Do.,
"Very disappointing considering how many people rave about this. The free version is too restrictive and paid version too expensive! It also has a kinda weird interface (in browser and app), which makes life difficult! Have deleted my account now.",
"Wow. WOW. And WOW! I've barely started. Just finished the getting started article and dang! The amount of effort put into this app and even the helpful personal tips along the way is fantastic! Just wanted to tip my hat to the individual(s) who put this together! Even more remarkably, it's free! HOW? This app just makes me wanna get things done lol Thanks so much!",
Great app! Easy to use. It has awesome challenges so you can compete with your friends. What I find interesting is that at the end of every year Todoist sends you an email showing you an overview of how your year went (what months were the most productive? What days and hours did you get the most done and what hours did you seem to move things around alot). It nice to know oh I'm more productive in the mornings etc...,
"A good option relative to what is out there. It's critical weakness is that it's complex to snooze items during the day, so you have difficulty doing zero inbox.  Update for programmer:  Thank you responding to my review.  One of the best features from Inbox was that you could snooze and email until a date AND time.  For example, I could have certain tasks appear in my inbox at 7AM for my morning's work, 1PM for what I tackle afternoons, and 5PM for home- and family-related stuff.  It was useful because I could schedule things to ping my attention at different times of day, and constant work to zero out my inbox.",
"[EDIT] Unfortunately since I wrote this review, Todoist has added pointless limitations and crippled the app - no more than 5 projects unless you pay *A LOT* to upgrade to professional. There's no middle ground. I think they've massively failed to understand their market. [OP] I was looking for the best alternative to Wunderlist. I think I found that in Todoist. In fact Todoist has some features I like ever better.",
"Absolutely love this app, I've been so organised since using this for the last 6 months. A feature I would love to see in future would be to have 'Tomorrow' as a default view. I primarily use 'Today' as it sorts my tasks into the projects I have set up and it's frustrating only being able to use upcoming to view my next day which mashes my tasks together.",
This app is really helpful to track all of tasks you have to get done. It has tons of different features to organize and remind you of you have to get done It has tremendously helped me manage my assignments in college.,
By far the best free management app. on parr with Familywall. Their website seems legit so I don't think my data is being siphoned to China. You do have to login but you can connect it to your Gmail so there is some security theater. I'm extremely skeptical when it comes to free apps but good job Todoist.,
"Todoist offers a number of useful features, so the concept is good. Widespread availability on platforms is also wonderful. Managing subtasks or mass edits can be a little annoying.",
"A very great app. However, just two things, and they are quite important. Tasks that are completed will not be shown if i dont choose to, and its very annoying tbh. The other thing is that i cant track down the completed tasks by searching the tags but only those incompleted, so what is the point of adding them tags into those tasks, bruh... Hence only three stars. And i noticed that there are so many cmts here complaining about the first thing i complained about.",
"Really good app, but not working correctly with Google Assistant is a real hindrance. I will rate it higher when that is fixed. Not just me, but multiple people saying they can't get it to work either.",
Really wish there was a way to make the alerts a little more consistent and powerful. Seems like they always get subdued. I've tried messing with the setting in-phone. Am I missing something? Android user.,
"I use it implement a semy understood GTD method. The app is quite flexible, and I thing that quite a few different methods could be implemented using it. It has tags, due dates, different levels of priority, and projects. All customizable. And then you could set yor own custom rules, ie filters, that let you create your own ""views"" of your tasks, giving you a lot of flexibility. This enables you to make different logical connections beetween the tasks at the same time.",
"Updating for 2020-still the most important app I use. It's been life-changing. ---- Todoist is the most important app I use. It's a tremendous way to keep track of professional and personal projects and tasks, make lists (weekly menu, shopping lists), collaborate at work, and keep track of my kids' responsibilities. Doist is an ethical, bootstrapped company with a customer-centric vision and a regular release schedule. If I could marry Todoist, you know I would.",
"I use this app everyday for years and really like it, but nowadays it is full of bugs, even simple things cannot be done without bugs. In the last couple of months the app has become noticeably worse due to bugs.",
"While I've only been using Todoist for less than a week I can honestly, with no exaggeration say that it is changing my working life. I am a teacher and organisation is key to teaching... I have no organisational skills at all. This app genuinely helps me keep on top of my work and I'm finding I am no longer falling behind on my work, no longer stressed when I drive home and feel so much better and calmer about my job - I can actually enjoy it! Because it is the best! Thank you Todoist!",
"The February 8th release is completely broken. Will not sync. If you try to update a task it will crash. It seems as if there was no testing done on this! And now five days later, still no fix. If you have not upgraded don't.",
So I am a little frustrated that I can't actually give you money. I need the reminders for this app to be worth it for me and I can't upgrade because it won't let me upgrade in the app and when it tells me to go to the website it just force opens the app every time I log in. Not a great way to make profit. I'm going to continue to use it but the lack of reminders makes it less than appealing.,
"One of the best Organizing app. The UI very simple and easy to understand , you can track, note, and also you get a bunch of template for your work flow. 100% Recommend who is looking for a to-do list or Note taking",
"Been Pro user for more than a year. Very nice UI, clean interface, tags, however requires subscription for reminders, which I consider basic functionally. Considering this, there are better free alternatives.",
Super useful app for productivity. Loved it,
"Full options has no buy option just yet ANOTHER subscription endlessly that I can't really afford anyway that'll screw with my bank account someday and I'll have to fight to end and regret overall. Gee thanks... pass on that. I'll go spend my money on a paper planner that won't be an endless list of auto transactions trying to break me. I'm done with this type of thing, seriously. I can't take anymore.",
I used other to-do list apps before but this one is just perfect. I love google calendar integration.,
"Only worth it now if you want to pay. I used to use todoist for everything, work, chores, planning my wedding, all of it. I recently returned to it and found my free account limited to 5 projects. This has completely hamstrung the utility of this app and I will be uninstalling it after years of dedicated use and switching to one of the dozens of free project management alternatives.",
"This app is good. But when i added a widget to the screen, at times it doesnt work properly. I have to go to the app again and add or cancel my finished tasks.",
I use it everyday with the desktop app. it works great to quickly capture tasks before I forget them. The comments and attachments feature available as a paid account is super useful. Customer service is fast to reply to reported bugs and so friendly.,
"This is about as good as apps get. The app is powerful but not overcomplicated. It's beautiful, intuitive, fast, reliable, and customizable. Really don't have anything negative to say! Thanks for a great app, devs!",
"I feel like I've spent my entire adult life looking for a to do system that works the same way my brain does, so it's hard to overstate how relieving it is to have found Todoist. When I hit the limitations of the a free account, subscribing was an absolute no brainer. Please, please, please don't sell this app to a big company to screw up!!",
"I couldn't work out how to use this app and decided to stick to my conventional hand written to do list and I uninstalled this app. However, I still keep getting 'reminders' about things I never even put in myself (they seemed to be there, maybe as examples?, when I first installed the app). I find this really annoying. How can this even happen!",
"Can't use with VPN. I practice Information Security and prefer to use a VPN whenever I can. I use 2 Norton & NordVPN (not of course at the same time). In both usage cases, when my VPN is activated it would say there is no connection. I have even tried different servers. Is there a reason that VPNs are a problem for your service? How is your data management & security? Does your company view people's data? How do you keep others from being to steal others data, because username & passcodes...",
App was fine until last update now I can't edit tasks or figure out how anything works and I had to delete a ton of projects to make room for an invite that was auto rejected and user had to resend. There doesn't even seem to be a built in help feature,
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling.",
Great app even without the premium version. However would be nice if you could see the completed tasks checked off or crossed off you did that day or the last two days or the last 5 days. I think that would really keep you even more organized,
"dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free.",
"It's a good, simple to use app. My only input for improvements would be it's too easy for an item to be deleted and there is no way that I can tell to undo the action or recover the item. Otherwise, it suits my needs well!",
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit.",
"Seems pretty good initially. But i cant get the adding task by voice to work anymore. Google Assist keeps taking me to other apps instead of Todoist. It keeps adding items to some kind of internal shopping list. Update - I contacted support. They sent email with instructions on linking Todoist to GA. Works but too many questions now. Like others reviewers,, I just want to say. ""OKG... Add task to go to store"" and be done, or ""Ok,Anything else?""... ""no"". Too much dialog now. Used to work this way?",
I was very pleased with Todoist app for quite some time (I am paid /premium member) but since last 2-3 days ago the app stopped working correctly : push notifications stopped working and I am not getting push notification reminders on my android phone anymore. Please fix this bug as this is the only reason I need app at all. Thanks 🙏,
I used to have a separate to-do list and scheduled items into my calendar manually. This app has streamlined that wonderfully. The integration with Google calendar and Gmail is seamless and so useful. Fantastic little app!,
Useful once you get your head around how it works. The way it's set up when you first get the app is confusing to understand. It would be better to have a blank canvas and be guided from there. However once you figure it all out it's very useful.,
"This app would be better if it gave you the ability to repeat tasks. Most of my tasks need to be completed monthly, but it doesn't have the option to make a task repeat. I don't want to waste my time having to schedule the same task for every single month.",
"My husband set it up so we can tell Google to add to our shopping list, as a project. It's great in the kitchen, though a little inconvenient to add through all the taps on the phone.",
"I am coming from Wunderlist and I am slowly adjusting to this app. There are several things on that app that are not on Todoist. I wish I could copy repeated tasks to the next week instead of having to retype it. I also would like to be able to see my finished tasks for the week. Completed tasks disappear and are not in the completed tasks (unless it is a sub task). I forget whether I did things or not, hence the reason I need an app like this!",
"Great tool. Easy to use so that you don't give up using it out of frustration. Just naturally type to add a task. Super cool. Don't need any of the premium features, so I enjoy what they offer for free.",
"É excelente! O único porém, é o reminder é só liberado com assinatura. Sugestão, criar um ""Todoist premium"" com essas features liberadas apenas para o usuário (sem o modelo de assinatura), eu pagaria por isso! ------ It is excellent! The only thing, however, is that the reminder is only released with subscription. Suggestion, create a ""Todoist premium"" with some features released only to a single user (without the subscription model), I would pay for it!",
"Very nice app with a lot of integrations which makes it very comfortable to use. Although I think some features are missing, e g. Grouping by project in a filtered view",
I like todoist a lot. I would love to see one feature to track my productivity better: To be able to start a pomodoro for any particular task. This way I can track the amount of time I spend on each task and can improve my planning as a whole.,
"Very handy app! :) When you are on the go and have random moments of reminder of your to-do lists, its very handy to just go on this app on your phone and start listing take, reminders, goals. Try it and you'll love it!",
"Well designed app, just wish it had some more flexibility for assigning dates and responsibilities. I also haven't been very successful at using the notification function.",
Easy to use and helps to track my list of things to do each day. I like that I can rearrange items to future days and prioritize them. Would be nice to be able to review past items but it is okay since it's a free app.,
I love the fact that I can integrate my work and personal todolist through this app. I have a work phone that doesn't allow calendar integration with Google calendar. Todoist wonderfully combines my todolist from work and home and plots it on my calendar for work as well as my Google calendar making life much organized.,
"Easy to use and really helps me with executive dysfunction and memory issues from ADHD. I do wish it would give me reminders more than once a day, but I suspect there's a setting for that and I just haven't found it yet.",
"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2.",
"Really like this app, using the free app. Easy to organise, you can set time and dates for when projects need to be completed. In a project you can add a sub project and sub task too. Very handy. You can share your whole project with someone and even tag them in a specific task should you be splitting a project up. The tabs for today and tomorrow are also very uselful as it is a quick reminder to what needs to be completed on those days. You can even set priorities to tasks on urgency. Great app",
"This 👏 app 👏 is 👏 amazing! Very clean design, cross platform stuff sync is extremely quick - checking off someone on my phone instantly checks it off on my Mac. Dark Mode is also present for the free version!!!!!!",
"I've only been using this app for a few days, but am already noticing how helpful it is. I was endlessly writing lists on scrapes of paper and getting in a mess. This is really helping streamline my workflow.",
"New problem The App is not working at all right now, keeps loading and show nothing.. Old problem The changes made on PC are not showing in the phone app... But if i add something in the phone i can see it in the PC... What is going on? Fix this please (I contact support by website, still not fixed) ( at todays date July 2, i just check and there is no updates available for my device)",
"Great themes, simple UI, and has so many features out of the box! Most todo apps only give you access to a couple of projects or a few tasks before they pay wall you. This app is amazing I would recommend to anyone",
"After the last update ""view all"" display changed from by project to by due date and messed up my entire view. No option to change it back..... Im done with this app, they keep changing things everytime it updates and the changes are annoyances not improvements.",
"How did the rating get so high when even reminders need to pay a premium? If it was good then I would'nt mind doing a free trial, but I was out the moment there is not even reminder, so basic of to-do lists, in free version. Just doesnt make sense.",
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!,
"This app has the potential to change your life for the better. Tasks become much less stressing once you note them down, and feels rewarding to tick them off. The user interface is extremely well thought-out. I simply love it and want to thank the people involved.",
"By far my favorite productivity app. Very well thought-out, but also intuitive to use. Great job guys. The only enhancement I can suggest is adding the capability to measure streaks for the reccuring tasks.",
"Newest update nerfs the widget so you can't utilize as much functionality to it. The main app also features the annoying swipe to select feature now. The previous click to select was fine and this new change doesn't add anything, only creates a new barrier of frustration.",
"Free version so far and it helps me stay organized with the Getting Things Done approach. Reminders, Labels and File Attachments are a Premium feature though. Might actually upgrade, it's that good!",
"Exactly what I've been looking for to manage my personal projects and to do lists. After trying out the free version, I upgraded to paid immediately. It's just the right price with easy-to-use features on mobile and web versions. Not sure how managing team software projects would work on it--we're satisfied with Jira and Rally for those.",
This app revolutionized how I keep track of daily tasks and HW assignments. I can even set reminders to look at certain Email in certain days. This app helped me to go from being an average C-/ D student to an A/ A+ student. This app really helps me to prioritize what assignments need to be done first and it helps me organize what assignments go into what class. Excellent job on the App,
"I use this at home, at work, and on my phone. I have created templates and checklists that have already been useful. I work in healthcare, and I'm keeping up with changing insurance requirements better than ever! It works beautifully with the GTD method.",
"I dislike that I must pay to use comments, and I dislike that there is no way to add a description to the task. I understand that in regards to the former that you need to make money, but the latter issue makes it clunky if one has a long and complicated task with resources one must past links to in. But I do appreciate the app and am impressed with how consistently you stay on top of squashing bugs. Keep it up! Can't wait to see kanban implemented!",
Couldn't live without it. On all platforms always at hand. Simple enough to be intuitive. Advanced enough to offer all I need (I have Premium). Google calendar 2way sync stellar! Absolutely love Todoist.,
Very customizable and powerful with filters. Missing start date and some planning ability due to this. Awesome that it is on every platform I need due to web interface that is excellent.,
I love Todoist but it frustrates me that tapping a project in the sidebar doesn't show me all of the sub-projects and tasks like it does on the desktop app. Would save me a lot of time navigating the app.,
"Useful for someone with ADHD who needs a way of making prioritized lists but has a hard time remembering where said list is, what else I need to do, etc. Great shortcuts built in to set up future lists and prioritize those as well.",
"No way to use without login. I'm tired of all my apps trying to tie in with everything else. Just let me have a no-login option with the data residing purely on my phone. Had this installed for roughly 30 seconds, so I can't comment on the functionality.",
"Reminders are a ""premium feature"" apparently. Pretty much renders it useless for me, and $3/month is a lot to pay for something that is free elsewhere. Shame, it's a nice app, but only lasted 5 minutes for this reason. 2* given as it's at least easy to delete your account.",
"This is a loser. Upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial, no option in the app to return to free option. And I'm maxed out on tasks ON the premium. Will delete before I pay for premium. Prior review: Migrated from Wunderlist seamlessly. Much more cumbersome compared to Wunderlist.",
Honestly I've tried tons of apps to aid in productivity. This is the one I always come back to. Intuitive and able to view my list from all sorts of devices are great.,
"Amazing productivity app. But u 've to purchase the premium version to get reminders features, other then that. Really good, simple, fast, gets the job done. By being not in my face with reminders all time.",
"Moved here from Wunderlist, after trying other apps. This is so clean and easy to use and does everything I needed and more. My fiance and I can now both keep track of the grocery list! (So glad it has the ability to share with others)",
"of all the task apps I've tried over the years, Todoist has been the most reliable, fastest, useful. it is my only task tracker for personal and business. the Todoist team is responsive and constantly improving the app.",
"I LOVE TODOIST SOOO MUCH! I swear to God, I'm on top of everything and passing all my classes only thanks to it. I highly recommend this app if you're a student and need to plan your assignments and stuff. Setting reminders sadly does require premium, but I recommend it because it unlocks so many other benefits (larger file uploads, increased project limit, etc). Other cool things this app has is a Wear OS companion app that's actually useful (*cough Any Do cough*) and a karma system!",
"Today I was working with my tasks, writing a comment to one of them. I wrote about an hour, my thoughts, feelings, it was a list of 10+ different items. But after another cup of coffee I accidentally pressed Esc on my keyboard - this closed popup with the task and its comment. I didn't save it.. I thought all my writing got lost.. But thanks to all Todoist team - I reopened the task and comment was there, safe and sound. Thank you very much!! The BEST APP EVER!!!",
"Overall it met my expectation but do hit a bug. When I try to sort with labels, the app will crash. Cannot reopen until I use the chrome extension in my desktop to remove the sort before it opens again.",
"Don't waste your money! Instead, to get a free trial you have to select business even if you aren't a business. Then you can still experience the miserable support experience of 6 days of radio silence (and it has now been 48 Hours of radio silence on my urgent ticket). The app/system/api is fairly good, but I would expect better bug support if they claim to have a business or even premium plan.",
"Overall, very good app. But the latest update made one thing almost impossible - moving a task from project to project. I can't find a way to do that neither from task list nor from task details view. It makes my workflow almost unusable :(",
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day.",
"Looks good, but is for me worthless without notifications. And then 3-4 $ per month in order to activate notifications is way too much. Maybe 1 $ could have been worth in order to move away from Microsoft's free TODO app.",
"Doesn't allow multiple calendars to be synced, making it useless if you're someone that wants to use this for work and personal. Also no proper calendar view. Anydo does both of these things.",
It's good. Reliable and fast sync across platforms. Slightly annoying they got rid of the project drop down on quick task entry as using the # button is annoying on a mac. But will let it slide as rest of app is so good.,
Loved this app until the pop up to install the widget started appearing all the time! I can't get rid of it and it's destroying my experience. I can't make a list without it appearing 2-3 times,
"I love this app so much. It offers a lot of features yet the file size of this app is minimal. The only problem I have with this app is when I try to edit my account name, it only concatenates my input from my previous name, and I just see white background in input and also without blinking text cursor. Please fix this and I'll rate it 5 stars for sure.",
"Some pieces are a bit less than intuitive, some scheduling features are better on the desktop app, and a buy forever option would be really cool. Otherwise no complaints.",
"*EDIT seems to be more stable now, thanks! Been working great but now a bit unstable, crashes after adding tasks from quick access. Crashes randomly in the app. Good phone so I don't believe its that. Cleared cache too.",
the best app I've found for implementing David Allen's system for Getting Things Done!,
"This is my all time favorite calendar app. The amount of customizability along wih the smoothness of the app is great. I use this for mainly for school work, as well as other random reminders and it really helps.",
"Great app. I have the premium app for more than 1 year. But there is a bug that hasn't changed. If you click the share button to social media and immediately cancel it, you are going still to get the rewards",
The best thing about this app is that it lets plan your your to do list not only for present but also for future. And the way it show the weekly calendar in its upcoming is just amazing. And it also sort the task according to priority and time assigned.,
It's a great app ive been using for a while! but only 4 stars cuz I'm not loving the new update with the assignee feature. I don't like that there are question marks all over the place just because I can't assign tasks in my private projects :(,
"I switched from Microsoft ToDo because it had problems with app-website sync. I like this app design, description field on todo item, sub-items design and it worked well so far (while I was migrating manually my tasks from previous app).",
"Awesome! i wish u add a "" Push a day forward/ backward"" option for tasks with date , like when i have and emergency and i can't do my tasks instead of rescheduling, i want to push the whole week a day or 2 with the same days order , or when i finish my tasks earlier than expected i want to bring the whole calendar a day or 2 earlier instead of doing this manually.",
Pretty good. I use it as daily reflection to the task I have accomplish for the day.,
"this app helps me a lot! I can't even describe what I'm feeling right now :"") just wanna say thank you very much for creating this app! well this app deserves more than 5 stars tho LOL I can download it on my laptop also and it will sync by itself if u use the same account! but I have one suggestion for making kind of daily/weekly schedule with no fee, that would be really great! :D thanks a million!",
"I REALLY Hate that every time I reach my goal the app pops up and asks if I want to share it. No I don't and no one cares if I accomplished my tasks it is over sharing. I do like having a shared family chore list. Overall the app is good I get frustrated by the forced social/share aspect I am slightly annoyed by ""game-ifcation"" but I can avoid that by staying in perpetual vacation mode.",
Honestly it's so great and for free too. never felt so productive. wished they made reminds free but the scalability makes up for it. either on my phone or chrome or desktop I'm always see what I need to have done!,
Wonderful native app of an excellent service. I am very glad that added dark mode. Would've preferred of there was some options to adjust the gesture but it's manageable and easy to use.,
"hands down best task management app. easy to use platform, intuitive motions, lightweight on flashy heavyweight on functionality. the karma incentive really surprised me how effectively it helps me want to stay on track.",
"This app is perfect! Simple to use and full featured. Let's you organize your ToDo's tasks into Projects, Subjects within the Project, and even sub-tasks within the tasks. Fantastic tool for logical thinkers. If you are a random thinker like my wife, she just lumps everything in one list, then uses labels to sort things out. Love that it also does Kanban board too.",
"Update: The issue was fixed within a few days. Thank you for quickly addressing the problem. Please fix the bug in the app. As of 4/8/22, it has been crashing on both my phone and tablet.",
Really enjoy this app! If you like making to do lists this is simply perfect for you. I'm on the standard one and it's v good. I'm toying with paying for the premium features so everything is integrated with my calendar and I can have reminders which I think I'll love,
"I have tried and used so many task management apps over the years but I am now happy I have found the best. As long as it continues to perform and does not get bought out by Microsoft or someone else who ruins it, I will not be changing!",
"The UI looks great. Love the dark theme. Problem is I downloaded this app because it was advertising watch compatibility in the pictures but the app is nowhere to be found on my Galaxy Watch Active, which was the only reason I chose this specific app.",
"The app is great but can be very limited. Having to pay monthly just to get certain features. You can't set reminders unless u pay. Only 5 projects are allowed, no labels unless u pay. Still pretty good tho",
Literally everything that i ever need in a todolist app... the minimalistic design and AMAZING user interface is soo user-friendly and helpful to stay organised and plan my days accordingly. Honestly this has been nothing short of a life changer for me.,
"Without a doubt the best app for creating to-do lists and get things accomplished. From work to personal life, this app has allowed for seamless task creation, completion and reminders. You can even tie into your outlook and gmail, use to create simple follow up process. Thanks ToDoist, you guys rock!",
Having a free ToDo App without a reminder functionality is as good as having a stopwatch app that doesn't count. What's the point if it's gatelocked behind a premium? Might as well have released the app as paid. This is considering other apps have this for free,
"It's fairly useful! Been using it for a month, it's easy to reschedule tasks and the emails help remind me of things I had planned. I can also jot down spur of the moment things that arise.",
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.,
"Almost uninstalled this apps since there's shortcomings like no comments & tags features for the free version, but then suddenly it's available for the free version, thankyou! this is very useful for to-do list apps I can't describe it enough.",
"I have used the premium version of this task manager for several years. Cross-platform functionality is a must and it integrates well with several other programs (email, calendar, IFTTT). Great for those using GTD methodology. Try the free (limited) version, then upgrade for full capabilities.",
"This is a wonderful app, I love the simplicity and intuitiveness - it helps me reduce stress from the many things I need to do and instead allows me to focus and get more things done overall!",
"I have been looking for an app that mimics my paper journal. This is it! I am still learning but this is great. I can do everything in the app that I do I'm my journal and then some. I don't have to look for pens and stickers or washi tape. I can decorate in this app with just a few clicks. I would defenatly recommend this to anyone who wants a journal, to do list and more with just one app.",
"Nice app for daily todo tasks. Like the way we can organize projects, tasks, priority and label. Remainder in free version would have great but no complains as it does the todo task management way better than other apps. Kudos to the team!",
"Using it since years to manage both personal and professional space. Happy with it but can be improved. Overall, the best app in the market for managing tasks and much more. Cheers.",
"Very easy to use, and very flexible for however you use todoist. I fully recommend it, I now use todoist to organise all sorts of things. I particularly appreciate having task reminders as notifications.",
"I use the free version and it does enough for me to keep using it. The premium features don't seem aggressively sold, but they do sit there taunting you and they do seem useful.",
To do lists with reminders is all it does… But it works flawlessly and integrates with desktop app in real time. Definitely the best to do list out there… Because I've tried a ton of them.,
loving a super simple to do list on my phone screen. widget is simple to add to and check off completed tasks. I've been using the free version for a couple of weeks and have eliminated the scraps of paper in my pockets,
Love the app. Easy to add tasks and nice simple display across my phone and lappie. The desktop app took a hotkey though which I often use in another app and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it to another one.,
"Hard to find option to create recurring tasks, without those it's a no go, paid notifications/reminder. Google calendar offer those for free with pc and mobile interfaces Still recurring tasks are hard to find, additionally I would need to have recurring tasks that expire after X occurrences",
Haven't used it for very long but I like the format. I've created several projects in order to organize thoughts/ideas and future tasks. Nice to have an easy way to dump out the brain every now and then.,
"Great ux/ui, super easy to put a new task, and get your day organized. Another cool thing is that you can connect all your devices and also integrate your Google calendar. Also love the little hiden shortcuts in the web version. Keep up the good work and if you need more feedback would be happy to share 😉",
The only reason it is not a 5 star is because of some little discomforts. When a list is sorted I think the writing custom sorted is unnecessary or could be done in a mor3 appealing way. And it is my earnest request you guys make a calendar app or have an in build calendar in todoist. I want to plan stuff here and manage my tasks as well.,
Excellent app to keep my tasks in check. Only gripe is that the widget doesn't use the dark theme when I toggle dark theme system wide leaving this one single widget in light mode. Hope it gets fixed soon.,
It's a great app. Easy to use and load to-do list. Only challenge is you might miss the the notification. If they can just add sound to notifications. Otherwise I am enjoying the app,
"So far, so good! I am just learning and have adhd; it seems user-friendly enough to benefit from immediately, while offering more complex options when I'm ready. I'm looking forward to getting better at using it.",
This app needs a calendar view. Bonus points if you could incorporate a merge option with my google calendar. I'm a visual person so a straight up list doesnt do much for me.,
"i am a total chaotic mess and although pretty reluctant at first, this app changed my life!! its easy, friendly, helpful, quick, intuitive and teaches me to organise my life and my projects! thanks to all at todoist!",
"Migrated from Wunderlist and although it's still early days, it seems like a good alternative, although some key features are available only for the premium version. I might give that a go and report back.",
"Does great. Though I wish they added more features like having a brain dump specific list where you can store ideas for the future. You can do this in projects but I didn't want to mix that in with projects that already have an identity. Otherwise, does exactly as it should.",
Great app for sharing lists and keeping organized. Need improvement on deleting projects when done while using app. So far I have had to log in on the computer and delete there. That's annoying.,
"I organize all my life with it. I particularly love the keywords to set the priority, the categorie and the due date of each task. Love the ""slide"" feature to easily check or postpone a task. This is the best tasks organizer on Android.",
"Love the app, but I'm running into an issue where I try to show completed tasks in a project and it says there aren't any. This issue is fixed by going onto desktop and doing the same thing, but I'd like to see it fixed in the app.",
"The app was looking awesome until.....One of the most important parts of this app for me is ""reminders"". After installing the app, it was a bummer to discover ""reminders"" are only available in the paid version. Bait & Switch.",
"What I really liked (and what prompted this review) is how good the natural language support is - I can easily type 'stop Netflix subscription 28 days from now' and Todoist sets it as a task for 28 days later, without me having to figure out these small, time-consuming, decision-intensive details myself.",
"Have been using this app for over a year now and use it for pretty much everything. I use it to manage things for my students, my research at uni, general life commitments, work at uni. The education discount is amazing for the premium version!",
Amazing app. It's good to have something to keep me productive. As bad as it saunds me being lazy it helps me to keep on top of everything I'm planning out to do. I recommend to give it a shot since for chaotic people like myself it can do wanders just if you are willing to make first effort to work on your goals. Its just first week for me so don't want to prize it to much but I feel that difference already.,
Love this app. I was addicted to another to do app and it was very difficult to make the switch. The final push was Todoist's excellent 2 way sync with Google calendar. This has made me significanly more productive from day one with this app. Love it!!,
Todoist has 1 big flaw that really prevents me to use it well: if you schedule a task to be repeated daily and do it few minutes after midnight it will skip a day. Overdue tasks that are completed should add the repeat time to the previous date not be reset to the day they are marked compete!!,
"The best to-do app imo. Free version is more than enough for most users, sort tasks by date, priority or projects, get reminders, overall great. Super easy to sync tasks between devices.",
"This app is what has kept me sane and successful through college and grad school. It's annoying how it shows features that are only available in Premium, but the free version has everything you could need",
"easy to use and organise to do list in a variety of categories. it allows for parent and child categories, support priority assigment (1-4) my only qualm is that sometimes i work past midnight and if i check off daily goals of the previous day, they do not reload into the current. if there is a setting that allows checking off tasks retroactively, or one that locks daily tasks to their specific day it would be helpful and 5-stars",
"I wish widget would have a very compact design, just a list of tasks, nothing more -- no menu bar, no headers, etc. As for me, the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised.",
"It does what I need when I need it and it provides me with in information I require to be more efficient. Plus it is linked to Alexa so it it easy to add tasks or even groceries to my lust. It's a win, win!",
"it was easy to use the first few days, but now it's only adding everyday things (like feeding my dogs) to my list every other day, and not letting me fix it. it also doesn't send notifications so in order to remember my todo list I have to remember to open an app with my todo list.",
"PROBLEM WITH NEW UPDATE. Since the latest update, the app keeps crashing everytime I try to expand a task's subtasks using the built in ""down arrow"" button on the right side of the screen. PLEASE FIX.",
"The app is super buggy for Android. Can't make new tasks (the ""arrow/send"" button doesn't work) & existing tasks cannot be changed either. In summary, the Android app is completely unusable right now for me.",
"Overall this is an amazing app. I have a suggestion though, google calendar has two types of notifications. Default notification, default notification for full day event. Todoist is currently only taking default notification in account when google calendar integration is setup. In todoist, an event with only date should be considered as full day event and when syncing full day notification setting should be applied. If an event has date too, default event notification setting should be used.",
Really inconvenient. Sometimes people just want to make a to do list with out a date. This app is not helpful when it deletes what you didn't get done on a certain date. Really inconvenient,
This app is simply amazing. It's so easy to use and you can synchronize it with yohr pc and phone and it just works great. How longer I use the app how more I begin to wonder how it is possible that this app is free. I'm absolutely stunned by the possibilities of this app. 10/10 would definitely recommend this app to everyone!,
"Quick and fairly intuitive to use. Due dates for recurring tasks can be a little finicky. No built in way to review completion stats of recurring tasks, but it can be done using ifttt.",
**Edit** After seeing some wrinkles ironed out I cannot say enough good things about this app. It has helped tremendously to implement the Getting Things Done method. The fee is not outrageous and worth the price. The customer service is also fairly responsive as well!,
5 Star App let down by 1 Star Pricing. For basic users like me it's simply not worth £4 a month subscription to add the Reminders feature I need and a bunch of other features I'll never use. Would happily pay a one-off £4 fee to add reminders.... but went back to Google Tasks which is nearly as good and free.,
"absolutely amazing app, 100% free, and no ads. literally only improvement i want is ability to add reminders for the whole month, 7 days isn't good enough. Otherwise, well done guys!! Perfect",
I made a resolution to set better habits to steward my time and researched some options. I found this through Tim Challies' recommendation from the book Do More Better & productivity worksheet. He also provided some helpful tips to setting up different tasks under projects and categorizing the roles/responsibilities you have in your life (which is ever changing). I really like that I can set certain tasks to repeat daily or weekly and see the next 7 days ahead to plan out my day/week.,
"Todoist is a part of my memory now. As a single parent of two-kids with a full time job I don't know how I survived before. Now I dump everything I need to do on Todoist and don't bother trying to remember: It does the job for me. I have tons of things to do from kid's school related things to the house and health appointments, I keep everything there. I never miss anything. I strongly recommend to anyone with a lot of things to do (who doesn't nowadays:)",
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.,
"4 year full time user says, ""go elsewhere."" The most recent update has destroyed this app. You can only have a maximum of 5 projects or you have to pay for 300. It's unuseuable with such a low number of projects. You're forced into paying if you want to use the app. I've used this service for years and have really become accustomed to it. I'm very disappointed I have to start the process of finding a new app to use.",
ToDoist is awesome. Probably the thing that makes it stand out is it's natural language recognition. But I also love it's simple design yet wide range of customiziability options.,
"Not at all intuitive, on first impression. The brief tutorial suggests that you need to start by adding a project, but I can't see a way to do this. I added a task, but this then disappeared. No idea how this app works or how it is supposed to help with my life. Uninstalled.",
"I love this, I do wish some more features were free, but regardless it's fantastic either way. Would highly recommend it even if you're looking for a free systematic organizer.",
"love it, and I would buy a premium version for one price but im not interested in anymore monthly payment or yearly payments so ill stick with the free version. it's simple and does exactly what I need it to do.",
"Great app for productivity. Simple, great UI, easy to navigate and easy to use. I like it a lot and it helps me get stuff done efficiently without forgetting stuff as a student with a part time job.",
"It is the perfect solution for someone who has all kinds of proje ts on the go and is in need of a way to keep organized! It is fast, easy, and customizable! Very useful!",
"App keeps crashing after trying to complete 1 task. Not happy. I emailed as per app request. Got a reply telling me not to email, don't bother as that's not how to contact them. My app is still crashing. I've cancelled my membership subscription 🤷‍♀️",
"This app used to be perfect until they started collapsing all the tasks into one notification. This makes it too easy to ignore, severely limiting the usefulness of the app. Edit: No I'm not going to submit a ticket. Do the work yourself or pay me to do it.",
"I want to 4 stars this and say ""because there's still a room for improvement"" but this app is the best out of all the todo apps I downloaded. I became more organize in my works and it's super rewarding because I can see the task that I completed, it's motivating me to do more works and click more in this app lol. Thank youu, this is so much better. I still have lots of work, gotta goo!!~",
"it's a good app and easy to use, but when I try to reorder and arrange a list, it goes back to the order it was in before I tried to reorder it. in short, reordering lists doesn't work.",
"I've used many apps for to-do lists and for now this is the best of them. I would love to use it also as some sort of calendar- not only for tasks but also for events (things I won't have to check off). I'm not sure if this is a to-do list app, but maybe other users would love this feature too^^.",
"An AMAZING productivity app that simplifies my running of multiple orgs. I no longer have to remind people, follow up to know if things got done, worry that they didn't get the word, etc. Very easy & user friendly. New users don't need training...maybe like 2 minutes.",
"What's a pity. Heaving ADHD I really need an app like this as I need to be reminded daily, every day, if my listening of things to do. With great expectations I signed up and installed the android app. BOOM, I make a to do list and want to set a reminder but, you need to pay for a subscription to get audio notifications. I live in Africa, unemployed and living of so little money it will scare people in first world countries.",
"I went through all the stuff to link this to my Google Assistant, but it doesn't work right. I can get it to add a task, supposedly, but when I tell it to read my tasks it says I have no tasks for today and doesn't give me any way to list the complete set of tasks, the ones I just added. This is worthless.",
"Great at identifying. tracking, and completing tasks. Not perfect, but better than the alternatives I have tried. and continually improved.",
"Pros : no annoying adds, sync across all devices, enough projects in free version. Cons: inerface logic is not common - you have to get used to it, especially for lists, price - 3€ month.",
"Todoist is my go-to task mgt app. It complements my physical planner nicely and enables me to execute well on a daily basis. Great UI, stays sync'd across devices, and dead simple with all the right features.",
"I was facing a problem that my reminder never pop out at notification bar when it's time. I have send a few message to support team regarding this problem. But no one reply, just a member who call David, he sent me a welcome message. Then I replied him with my problem as well. He did not reply too. I have just paid for 1 year package, now I hope I can get my refund.",
"I like this app and this app is very usefull for me but when i purchased premium package for one year , and try to use reminder service that is not working properly ...i tried youtube to resolve my problem but my reminders not give me notification.... Then i sent an email to todoist team and they give me tickect no 408257, but still there is no response from todoist ... So please resolve my problem. I want to use this app and doesnt want to switch to other. app is good for me so i give you 5 star",
Wish you could set reminders for upcoming tasks instead of only seeing the task appear on its due date,
"Simple, intuitive, feature rich. Even the free version is more than enough for my personal needs. Collaboration will need extra feature in the paid version.",
free version was awesome until it wouldn't let me delete my tasks I no longer wanted & forced me to click finished on tasks I didn't finish. all because they wouldn't delete. I get email notifications too telling me I have unfinished tasks which is great & all but it's annoying when it's for tasks I tried to delete.,
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality.",
"I'm a person who loves a paper checklist, but my list is so long that the paper was becoming unruly. I love Todoist and how I can track all my to-dos in one place. I even have a ""waiting for"" list which allows me to follow-up on things I have delegated or requested. When I ""need"" paper, I just print my list. I like how I can search my lists and add snips and comments; I dont have to search through email. Highly recommend!",
"Crashing frequently when interacting with ""boards"" or items that were recently moved. Other than that I think the app is pretty well put together.",
"Great App. Well organized and User friendly UI. Although, monthly subscription is a bit much, I'd rather pay full price for the whole app and get all the features it offers.",
"I really like that you get notified after a few days if you forget to complete something, both on your email and phone. Although I haven't tried other to-do list apps, this one works great so far and I definitely recommend it :)",
"Do you love spam email and push notifications on an app that harvests your data? Try this!! You'll get multiple emails and notifications daily. Go ahead and type in ""buy ___ ' and see what happens to your adds. Took this spyware, malware, piece of junk ""list app"" off my device",
I have enjoyed using the app. I like that you can plan to do something and it's tossed into the void or tossed into a bucket for planning later I wish I could hide buttons related to premium features but once you get used to what is what you can avoid them,
Best app I have ever downloaded and well worth the $36 for premium. Every aspect of my life is organized now and there is no more stress... no more constant feeling that I'm forgetting something... amazing tutorial and super easy to use! Thank you to those that have contributed to the development of this wonderful app!!!!,
"Guys, please make it harder to accidentally 'finish' tasks cause it's getting really annoying. Anyway, amazing app, have been using it for a long time and I feel like it's impact on my life has been immense.",
"I think its a great app, although I do have one suggestion. After completing a task, especially for the day, maybe it would be more motivating to cross it out and keep it there, so that one could see how many tasks they have completed till then and how much they have left.",
"True to its claim! This all-in-one app is definitely a productivity booster (unlike other mainstream productivity apps I've tried.) ;) Easy to use, great interface, very rewarding (esp. when you see your karma level goes up).",
"Cool and descent. Just wish to show completed things automatically. Each time i need to look at them Also while showing completed things, display it as recent first 1. To do 2. Completed recent 3. Past complete .. .. Like wise",
Best task management app and ive tried them all. I keep coming back to Todoist because its flexible enough without being too overwhelming. The app is constantly getting updates and improvements.,
"I have been using Todoist for about 5 years now on Android, iPhone, the iPad, & MacOS. All work well and sync seamlessly. I love the simplicity and the ability to swipe away completed tasks.",
What I'm looking for is scheduling calls. Not just typing call so and so but click on call button and my contacts would pop up to choose from. When you have this I'll gladly pay a fee and will be strong proponent of the app.,
One of the best task managers. I specially like quick add function. But I can't use it because The free version doesn't have reminders and paid is very costly when there are many free options also available.,
"I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend.",
"Great, works with my Google home so I can just blurt out stuff that pops into my head without interrupting what I'm doing. I would like a bit more control over the details and settings in the app itself but that's just me",
"Used to love this app, but the new widget is ugly, unreadable, and too easy to accidentally check something. I'll be looking for a replacement if this hasn't been fixed by the time my subscription runs out.",
"great little app. not too intrusive, very intuitive, and super easy to use. I just wish i was better at following through on my lists so i didnt always have the tray icon reminding me of what I failed to do today!",
"Excellent app. It has got so many things. Looks great visually. Tho the whole monthly payment for a checklist app is too much. 1 dollar = 73 rupess. 4 dollar = 292 rupees a month. , 36 dollars is more than 2000 rupees. Please make the price more friendly. Other than that it's great.",
I love how easy it is to create the task with scheduling due to the way it picks up keywords. I haven't used it as much as I plan to but that I can interact with Todoist through my Google Home is a very appealing idea.,
"Good enough, but is not a replacement for my old character mode MS-Dos program I wrote years ago. What I need is to be able to add attributes to each task and select from a defined list of values for each attribute. I then need to be able to filter and sort by any selection of attributes and values. Labels are not enough for this. I also want to be able to report on the number of outstanding and done tasks by attribute including totalling effort estimates for each. Basically, underpin the app with a relational database and provide an SQL query facility.",
Very nice and useful. This app really helped me declutter my mind and thus become more productive. It has complete features and I think it's just right even without Premium. Truly recommend this app for those in schools and offices...,
Love this app for keeping me organised. Would be 5 stars if there was a calendar on the right side when using the desktop version. So I can choose which project I want to view on the calendar.,
the only reason I had premium was because I could get SMS notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications. beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar.,
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads",
"Looks decent, reminders locked behind a ridiculous pay wall. $48 PER YEAR. Why not a small one off payment? It's a simple app. I'm sure a lot of customers have walked away simply because the price is too high for what it is.",
"Would be a great app if you didn't have to pay for the pro version ($50/year!?) just to be able to get reminders/notifications for to-do items, seems like a very basic feature for a to-do list app to have.",
"The dev responded claiming the sign up process is easy, but **I don't need any of the features that signing up provides**. I do not want backups, or access from other devices. Mandatory sign in instead of these features being optional is why i continue to give this one star.",
"I have never run into problems with this app. it works amazingly. I use this from work school and home. From my desktop to my chrome book for school to my phone for travel, work, etc. best to do list ever!!",
"The mobile version is great, but is there a reason that the web interface is suddenly so slow and unwieldy? It's been a few weeks now, so I'm deleting this app and creating lists on a new app, in case anyone has any recommendations.",
"Really enjoy this app it has literally saved my life. I have a problem with how obsessed i am with to do lists and writing down everything, so this app has been awesome because i can keep it all in one place and even change up when i want to do it, etc.",
It's the best In my opinion. But I feel tasks should not just be overdue. I think introducing an option to indicate that you didn't do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks,
"I crave other ways that I can use my smartphone as a scheduler. this app closely approaches Google Keep which I use daily. There are many indispensable features that aren't used in any other ""productivity"" apps. Check it out, better yet, write a schedule and include experimenting with this app. Bet you find some pretty slick features!",
"Brilliant app! Gets to dos out of your head makes life easier to manage. Only critique is it could work with Google calendar and emails more seamlessly but they are working on that from what I hear. Download it, make it a habit!",
"The only thing that's missing is Scarlett Johansson's voice praising me everytime I complete a task. After hours of research, I realized that Todoist is the best choice for an organisational app. Really, really happy with my choice.",
"love it! Hiwever the with the new update & check boxes I am accidentally pushing & ""completing tasks"" that are not done, which is super frustrating. I also wish I could see all of my different Alexa lists.",
"its been really good and useful. I havrnt figured out how to link it to my google home, but im blaming user error. lol i love the projects feature and the easy switch btw desktop and mobile views and features. really happy with it!!",
"How did I ever get anything done before I found todoist? I use it on every device (the experience is seamless), for everything. Heck, I rely on it so much I just might upgrade and actually PAY for it... which is against my religion (I'm a practicing public librarian). As a planner, lister, former project manager who sees everything as projects, this is pretty close to perfection for me.",
"I've spent lot of time creating great multilevel reccuring subtasks just to find out that I actually see them unorganized in most needful page - today! And in Projects they are organized, but all together, regardless deadline. This is sooooo inconvenient, that makes having subtasks functionality just useless. Why can't you show subtasks under their parents everywhere? REPLY: Sorry, but it's inconsistent logic, as currently you show subtasks, that are NOT due today under task, that is due today.",
"Overwhelming. Too many little features that are too specific and useless to most, while basic things like reminders are only available if you upgrade. (In short: hard to use, and a but of a cash grab)",
"This app is so easy to use! Scheduling, using templates, differentiating projects, organizing ideas, and more is so simple and works just like my brain. Absolutely love it!",
Works well. Would be nice if there was an option for completed tasks to show with a strike through rather than disappearing forever. I like to see what I've achieved.,
have been using it for almost a year now and find it very useful. would like to see a feature where you can add a location to a task so as to make Google calendar and map integration more seamless.,
"I paid for premium on this and it is by far the best todo app I've used. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 stars for me is that it needs an option to set what time your day ends or when the day starts. Because i usually end my day at 2am and by that time tasks become overdue and karma points are not credited for the previous day. Nonetheless, great app 👏🏼",
"Very good app, which is helping me organise and manage my life. Not without its flaws (e.g.crashes and glitches). I have provided constructive feedback to the devs. One star off for penalising non-US purchasers. I resent paying unfairly in pounds what American customers pay in dollars (European customers are ripped off in the same way). The makers claim this is because they have to collect 20% VAT, but this still does not explain why I had to pay £36 when I should have paid about £26 plus the 20% (you do the maths).",
"Does the job perfectly for me! A great set of features with NLP and amazing sync with Google Calendar. No Ads! Love it An update made notifications for tasks as Pro only, A little disappointed since it's an important core feature :/",
I've only used it for 3 days but I have experienced a lot of bugs. Unfortunately their support email is not supported anymore so I have no ways of reporting. New tasks keep disappearing on me and my sections often duplicate for no apparent reasons.,
"Sending a request, setting a password, even attempting to delete my account gives an error. Tried to reset my password, and I got an error message saying the reset code has expired. Even the Chrome extension is useless.",
"Handy app to use for capturing and organising projects and tasks. Took me a little while to find my groove using it but I am finding it really useful when combined with elements of the ""Getting Things Done"" methodology.",
This is a great tool with a minimalist design. One feature I would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget. That would take this to the next level.,
super easy to use. creating and adjusting items is simple. the notifications settings gives lots of options. emails sent to make list items and websites as items are super helpful.,
Incredible app. Don't have words. But I would like to request you about adding a new feature of customisation of timing of when to start the date and also about adding a feature of Sub-section.,
"The app itself is totally fine. I've been using it extensively both for my personal and work GTD-management, the app has a lot of my personal data, activity and thoughts. I'm becoming more and more aware and worried about my digital privacy. Can't be overly careful with these things today. I don't use external authentication in Todoist because I don't want to randomly lose my account after some random ban in Google/FB. But I desperately need 2FA protection in Todoist! We're waiting for too long!",
Used to be amazing but the last day just keeps crashing and app won't open at all. Total disaster as I'm in the middle of a project. Website works fine but is much less user friendly on a mobile. Please fix the app!,
"everything I need to ensure I'm on track for my day, love it.",
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking.",
"it's fine. I dont have pro, but without experiencing it first i won't pay for it. or try a ""free trial"" after putting in my credit card info just to get charged unexpectedly or when i forget. i hate those.",
"Overrides set task order if priority is not at the same level - your selected chronological order will be ignored without any option to disable this. If tasks are completed and restored they go to the end of the list, not the position you chose making this inappropriate for projects that are recurrent like mapping out activities of daily living. 1 star from me + an extra since order may not be important to others (eg. for shopping lists).",
"Love it, hope you guys fix up the widget soon, I'm always having problems with it not switching the veiw to the next day",
"The best todo list app for sure. Been using it from a while, you can feel yourself being productive if you use this app regularly. There is no ads at all. UI is pretty straightforward and easy to use as well.",
Please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window. There are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc. Check how Google Calendar widget shows information in agenda mode.,
"honestly theres something just very satisfying about brain dumping into your inbox, assigning things to your ""Today"" box, and emptying that box every single day. as well as just organizing everything into ""Projects"" that give me an overhead view of everything I feel. its allowed me to focus more on one thing at a time, cause i know everything else is already organized",
"A great app that helps you keep track of tasks so quickly and easily! You can prioritise your tasks and add sub tasks so you can stay organised, I have also connected mine to my alexa for daily morning updates. Using this app really helps me to focus on what I am meant to be doing and how the week ahead is looking.",
I loved it but the recent update changed the reminder settings for pro only which requires a membership. Dissapointed in that change as it was complimentary all this while. Still a good app but not happy with the direction it is approaching. Goodbye Todoist!,
"There are apps with more features and 10000 other things inckuding making coffee for you but this one takes the cake. Simple, no fuss and straight forward functionality. Hit the ground running.",
"Overwhelming! Stop it! First time opening the app and I'm inundated wih a bunch of preorained tasks! This DOES NOT help someone with lack of motivation and a list of tasks already needed to take care of. I'm absolutely INSCENSED that an app could be so blind. Let the user make tasks manageable, instead of telling them what they should do!!",
"It's very helpful although, I would like the task to stay for the whole day instead or just cross it out so I could see what tasks I have accomplished. Overall, it exceeded my expectations. Good job!",
"It worked perfectly on my old Android 7 phone, but works awkwardly on another Android 11 phone with Nova Launcher. The widget keeps loading almost all the time, and the Add button doesn't. It works again if I open the app first.",
"Using it for the past 6 months, maybe less. Simple and clear design, you can track everything you're planning to do, also great widget.",
"I love everything about this app, especially the website which was great guides and blog posts, but a deal breaker for me is that the widget does not sync with your device theme (the app itself does, fortunately). Please change this!",
This app is a simple and easy to use way to make your goals seem effortless. The amount of things I have been able to accomplish as a new manager can be attributed to Todoist. I use it everyday and for everything. Don't bother trying to find a better tool to be efficient with your time.,
"Loved this app. There should be an option of setting different goals for different days of the week, rather than having single daily goal. I think it would be good feature to include. And also you can do that to week and months.",
"Found this very useful in keeping track of my todos, however, there are times where I accidentally check of a task before completing it. Is there a way to check tasks that have been marked off already and undo them? Update: Literally minutes later I found out how to undo them. You just go to your activity log and uncheck that specific task 😅😄",
"Their response to my original comment tells me whoever is responding doesnt have the app installed, i cant reply so heres another 1 star. I have turned off all emails in general and it doesnt matter. It will email me if i dont make a stretch goal for the day. I add the easy ones, the stuff i have to get done and my stretch goals. It will send an email for each and every missed todo for the day. Doing to much",
"by far the worst app I've ever used. first it didn't work well cuz it didn't save, uncheck boxes, etc ( ive used it for 2 months) then I tried to delete my account and I swear to you they made deleting the account extremely difficult on purpose first theres no way to delete it via the website which forced me to download the app and then the app asks me for my password but I loginned in using google months ago. so you gotta reset your setting and then delete the account. its absolute trash",
"Excellent task minder app. Allows me to create tasks from my email. Able to associate tasks with projects, tag them with labels, set due dates, get reminders in advance of due dates, set recurring tasks, set subtasks, set targets for my productivity, attach important files. A very thorough task minder, with both GUI and shortcut key inputs when creating tasks. I went from the free version to purchasing a subscription very rapidly. If you are keen on minding important tasks, consider this app!",
App is good but definitely not worth going with Pro version. In one year they increased annual subscription amount by 3-fold. I used pro version for last five years. But quit now since the current prices are insane. There are better alternatives at way lower prices.,
Great app for organising & tracking all sorts of work & projects. 5 stars if you could bring back option to create a Comment during the New Task. Adding a task description is good for some things but option to add a Comment at the same would cover all options.,
The app keeps on saying not responding. I can access it on my computer but thru my phone it just shows a black screen. Play give me a solution I have tried everything like clearing app data. Reinstalling etc.,
"Love the app! It's great for forcing me to do all those tiny daily jobs that I would otherwise find ways to avoid. Gone are the days of, ""I'll do it later""; now, the app tells me 'today is the day to clean kitchen hobs or get a haircut and you're going to do it whether you want to or not.",
"I wish it would cross off completed tasks instead of getting rid of them completely. I like the action of getting them crossed off but also having the ability to go back and see what I did that day, which I don't think this app does",
So smooth and versatile. Adjusts to what you want: straight forward if you want just a to-do list yet plenty of options if you want something more detailed.,
"great app. once you learn how to use it, it has all sorts of applications. worka across platforms, and syncs easily, even with other productivity apps.",
"It's a good app. You can even open your to do list on your computer and add tasks and cross them off on your pc, but the only thing wrong with it is that you don't get full access to all the features and you have to pay for some things",
"This app is amazing. I can easily track my personal work, as well as i can track my work for my business purposes. I can list, and mark it done as soon as i finish my work. Even the daily karma level, batch keeps motivating me to do more, to gain the Professional karma level batch. I totally recommend it.",
Moved to this app from any.do because the former app quit syncing with Amazon Alexa. This app syncs quite well with Amazon Alexa so I'm sticking with it. Takes care of both shopping and to do issues that I need. Quite happy so far.,
My boss recommended Todoist for keeping myself on task and organized. It's been so helpful and intuitive I've started using it outside the office. Very user-friendly interface.,
It's really helped me stay on top of the projects that I want to accomplish. I use the free version for a little while and decided it was worth paying for. The integrations are pretty cool too I'm looking forward to see what they roll out in the way of further integrations in the future.,
"Amazing app to manage my time, I don't forget tasks and my grades have improved a lot. All thanks to the amazing scheduling and reminders todoist provides. I will be sure to renew my subscription!",
Excellent app with desktop sync. Really good interface and options of allocating projects and labels etc to all tasks. Perfect to help be a lot more systematic and get on top of all work and home tasks.,
"This app has helped me manage my to do list in a more realistic and efficient way. It looks nice, it's easy to use and packed with simple but useful features. I now use two accounts one personal and one professional.",
it's fantastic! it's changed my whole way of working and reduced my stress levels enormously. Im doing a PhD and juggling several really challenging and unpredictable roles - todoist is helping me stay on top of a really complex range of tasks.,
"Great app but I faced a small annoying issue with the widget. If I check something off on my pc and opened my phone the widget is not updating even if I opened the mobile app, it is only updated inside the app and not in the widget. Until you fix this issue you can add a temporary solution which is a refresh button for the widget as in the app",
Todoist is a great app that executes the fundamentals with precision and excellence. I think this app is so helpful because its singular purpose in task management. I'm very pleased with my decision to go premium with this amazing piece of software!,
"The best GTD app I found so far. Stable, no crazy bugs, the sync is fast and it is awesome that will recognize due dates from written format (like on wednesday or tomorrow). I switched from Todo Cloud and I could not have been happier!",
"This app has everything you need and more. Fantastic widgits that help my efficiency, tons of ways to manage and organise your lists. I downloaded 20+ different list and note apps and this one definitely comes out on top.",
Using the free version. Would like to upgrade but I think $36/year is too expensive for the reminders and comments/files that I'd like access to. I am impressed with their privacy policy.,
"overall enjoy this app as a virtual bullet journal, but i wish I could have items that weren't attached to a date but just sit above or below the weekly view. also an in progress function would be useful.",
"This app helps me keep the grasp of every daily task as well as plan long term projects, and it works as tidy as possible. I couldn't recommend an productivity App more, it's just simple and effective. Thank you, Doist, for this amazing work.",
Beautiful and intuitive interface. Syncs with browser almost instantly. Very impressed with this app and happy that it has helped keep track of things i could have easily forgotten.,
Newest update - items I reschedule for another day keep popping up for today,
I use this to set daily reminders. One of the best apps I've used. Especially since I procrastinate so much. It helps me sort out my work and timings! I really enjoy it and I paid for premium to get the alarms. It's awesome. Thank you todoist!,
"This app is really good. however, I've been experiencing bug (?) lately and the app automatically exits my screen or it just turns white. same thing happens on my pc application.",
It's excellent and it is beneficial for students... The only thing that doesn't go well is the timer... It doesn't go off like an alarm. But this app truly keeps you focused.,
"love love love this app so much!! perfect way to organize my to-do lists and helps me prioritize any tasks I need to complete. ever since getting this app, I've been on top of all my work and have been more productive than ever. don't know what I'd do without this app, highly recommend!!",
"Great Todo app. Core features work as you'd expect. Syncing, sharing lists, adding notes (premium feature), filters. Also has Google home integration (a bit clunky, but works for adding tasks when phone isn't nearby).",
"Very useful integration with Chrome on desktop, sometimes a bit fiddly to set up recurring events using the text method, would rather make specific selections. Overall best task manager i have found.",
"Very good app. There are some features not available unless you upgrade but seriously I don't need those. This is a great, and simple, tool and helps me especially being not that organized a person",
Free version does all I need it to do. Creating tasks is simple an intuitive and even I even add subtasks sometimes. it really helps me to stay on task and keep track of what I have to do day to day.,
"So far the best to-do app I have used. Easy to add tasks and keep track of them, love the calendar features since I don't have to constantly remember to add repetitive tasks.",
"Useful but incredibly clunky application. The rescheduling tries to be very smart, and ends up being completely broken, with rescheduling not being set (on task edit), or tasks being scheduled on the wrong day on completion.",
Everything is well and good and easy to organise. *BUT* Reminder (Previously enabled) SHOULDN'T BE A PREMIUM FEATURE. Please look into it. This is a basic feature across other to-do apps.,
It might be better for other people but what I want is really just a simple to do list and reminder.,
"Todoist is exactly what I needed. Being able to create to-dos on a desktop or laptop browser, then being able to check them off on the mobile app makes things very easy.",
dislike the new update. has screwed the widget up. the individual lines are taking up too much space and its too easy to accidentally hit those checkboxes. then yoy have to go into the app and undo.,
"After almost 1 year of trying to adopt, I have given up. Repeating tasks are nice but not when they end up on the wrong days because they change during set up. App tries to do too many things.",
Will not open keeps crashing,
The best app for organizing.,
It's really good helps me manage my projects and stuff,
I do not like the continued forced reviews!!!! if you want authentic reviews from people give them space and allow them do it in their own time!!!!,
best to-do list app!! it's super clean and easy to use but it still has all the features you'll need. you can do mostly everything you'll need in a to-do list without buying premium which is nice plus no ads.,
I really like the app. But when you will make a nice compact ( yet informative) view for the app and desktop? It will bring app to next level as it will look less overwhelming. At least for me.,
"Hello Doist, this is the best task management app I've ever seen and I wish you the best of luck making this app better for all of us. I have one request for a feature, I would like to use custom colours for my priorities. Thank You very much in advance, from a long-term user.",
"Rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working. Rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear, earlier I have experienced that it duplicated tasks. This way a basic functionality is broken and I just lost what should I follow-up today... No activity log available, as that is a paid feature. I guess I will never try that now.",
"Just wanted a basic notepad to keep track of things to do, instead had to grant access to a bunch of stuff and now it won't stop emailing me. Ended up uninstalling and have to block the emails. Way too intrusive.",
"I'm not a fan of having to use a paper diary to keep my life on track. Todoist has saved me in more ways than one - I can access it from any device unlike ColorNote, and it motivates me with the Karma system. The only gripe? I've only used it for a week and still don't know how to use it effectively.",
designing filters very helpful for sorting and prioritizing while keeping BIG picture. great to have info across platforms. easy to add items on the goal. Well written help guides and usful tutorials on YouTube.,
"Awful. Upgraded to premium and tried to use it. Completely unintuitive, difficult to use and definitely not user friendly. I got so frustrated with it I literally cancelled my subscription right away.",
"Tried every solution on market, can say for sure, it's the best planner for now",
I like using this for personal use and wish I could have more lists instead of just 6.,
"I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane.",
"Convenient, but I suspect it arbitrarily deletes tasks, and the support team isn't helpful. Support ticket 692041. Happened several months ago, and yesterday happened again. I'm now looking for alternatives, as I can't trust Todoist. Now evaluating Google Tasks.",
"Todoist is an amazing task management tool. I can organize my tasks into projects and subprojects, set due dates, and enter recurring tasks. My mind feels so much less cluttered now that I can offload things to Todoist. Highly recommended!!!",
"Loved this app until it started giving me a ""permission denied"" error every time I tried to open it. Deleted, downloaded again and it worked for a day before giving me the same error. I have not had this problem with any other app, so I can only assume the issue is with Todoist.",
"Love this app. I use it to keep track of ongoing, long term projects. But you can use it for day to day task (to do list) management Very easy to learn your way around the app and get started quickly. Highly recommended.",
"Still no way to bulk-clear completed tasks. You're also limited to 5 ""projects"" (Todoist's name for groups of tasks, like ""Groceries"", ""To Do"", etc.) Were you an early adopter that had more projects? Don't delete any of them, they'll be gone forever. This was my go-to note taking app for years. No longer.",
After the update all my completed sub tasks were deleted. I set those up because I uncheck them every month when I need to use the same lists over and over. Really annoying especially since I don't think I'll be using the new features at all.,
"This task/project management app revolutionised my life, brought about a clear judgement for prioritizing and balancing work & personal life. My favourite is the recurring task functionality which is excellent for habit creation but not also building consistency in project management. 4/5 cuz I haven't used the premium version yet.",
this app is so amazing man omg names project management/task management so much easier for me!! was using Any.do before which is good as well but this one is way better since I have multiple projects/task groups going on. Only thing I dislike is that add comments is behind a paywall. I wish you had that in the free version just consider it! any.do has it in free version. 5/5 stars still,
Fantastic experience using todoist. Really impressed with the simplicity and it's helped me manage my responsibilities much better than I ever could have imagined. Getting tasks out of my head and into todoist had changed my life!,
"Brilliant, but need time to learn. I use this in combination with David Allen's Mastering Workflow philosophy. Very helpful. But it takes several days to 'upload' all your priorities and tasks to the app. That is to do with human strategy, not the app. But the app makes it quick and easy to structure.",
Unable to sync with Google calendar on Android. Unable to cancel lost $36 bucks in 30 minutes. Had to get pro to set up feature. The mistake I made was not starting with 1 month. Leave and learn. Refund from these people none existent.,
"I've been using Todoist for years now and it keeps improving, the Latest foundations update has really changed things for me the addition of sections and the task view with subtaks has reduced the sheer volume of projects and sub projects to manage as I can now fit them into a smaller number of better organised projects. The task view is a master stroke as I am able to focus in on a particular task. the only Improvement I'd ask for is the ability to track my time spent on tasks a countdown timer that I can set myself from the task view so I can take breaks at more healthy intervals and timebox tasks as well as giving me data to help me better estimate my future tasks. Keep up the great work guys, your work is a life saver to me",
Really Great app to start organized. I've been using the mobile app in addition to the desktop app and the two have incredible synergy! Todoist was even nice enough to offer a trial of the premium version,
"Was a bad decision to move to ticktick instead of this great app, will move back to todoist soon again.",
"Love the desktop version. Ability to quickly add task using shortcut is my fav, without having to go application window. I wish there was an ability to add comments in free version.",
"Todoist is the best to-do list app I have encountered & I have tried A LOT of them. Reminders? Subtasks? Tags? File attachments? Voice recording? Subprojects? Integrations? They even have templates and a blog that gives productivity tips. 2 months ago I would have suggested they have kanban boards. I was integrating MeisterTask and Todoist through Zapier because of this. But just like that, they introduced the board feature and I immediately deleted MeisterTask, just like that.",
"So far Todoist has worked fine, but the fact they want you to pay a monthly fee to set a ""reminder"" is ridiculous. So many times I'm in the middle of something and can't finish a task right then and I want to be able to set a reminder. Time to move on to another app.",
"Great app!! The only thing that would it make better is color-groups. For example if a few things are about the same subject, you should be able to put them together. Then you get a better overview.",
Receiving way too many emails and reminders on my personal email and as notifications. It's crazy spamming! It's also not easy to organize with. I'd use simpler notes apps to jot down ideas and lists.,
"I think it would be more competitive if one or two of the paid for functions were free but overall it's a solid app. It functions well for how and why I use it. No complaints so far, just good vibes!",
"It's simple and easy to use. I like it very much. I use on my mobile and computer that made me handle my a lot of task. But I want a calendar view function, so I can see clearly my task of all month. Do you have a plan to add it?",
"Very simple, yet has the most thoughtful features. Been using the free version for over a year now and my productivity and peace of mind have both skyrocketed.",
Integration with Google Calendar is second to none. New card (kanban) view is amazing on both my desktop and Android phone. Have tried them all. Keep coming back to Todoist. Just the best.,
Great app. I'd never be able to keep track of all of my work to-do items without it and the projects function makes it super easy to keep my stuff organized and easy to find.,
a paid to do list application with notifications and reminders that don't work... so many times I've forgotten to do things because this app was supposed to remind me and didn't. that's unacceptable. switching to the Free gtasks instead.,
"Cool app, very essential, I could do without the lingering toasts on the bottom that cover all of the actions I might like to take on a selection for a ridiculous amount of time.",
"Really easy to use task manager, ability to schedule posts and get alerts when you're over due, great layout in projects or per week, ability to add links, emails, and subtasks - made my work life a lot easier!",
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.,
light weight enough not to slow you down. Enough features to build a system out off. Any idea or thing that needs doing through the day just gets thrown in here to get it out of my head.,
"Can you fix the bug where when adding a task, the keyboard fills up past the options that lets you select priority and projects? It's not critical but it's annoying to see at a UX level",
"Quite simply, the best. Cannot get over how user-friendly Todoist is--the devs clearly designed with *intention*. Pre-made templates are a godsend, text markup/emoji integration made me smile, and powerful organizational features made me stay. Kudos 🙌",
I use todoist every day and dont lose track of routines and/or infrequent but very necessary tasks. it's easy to use snd understand. I've used it on a couple of projects with success.,
"Initial Review after one week: Enjoying the simplicity and ease of access, organization level, and the speed that a project and group can be configured. The only issue I've had is changing indentation or parent/child relationships on tasks. wish more of the app was available to free tiers, but they've gotta make money somehow so i cant blame them.",
"Hey todoist! Why are you todoing this to me!? First you put these silly little checkmarks on my tasks that are 100% in my way (leftys are people too). I keep unintentionally deleting tasks and having to dig through my completed items to restore them. That's annoying! Now this latest update, you've taken away subgroups? Subgroups are part of the entire project. Having an overall view of all subs within a group is convenient. Having to flip from sub to sub is illogical. I just don't get it!",
"I just switched from doit.im, as I wanted something that looked better and felt easier to use. Todoist is pretty great so far. I will say that I think Todoist is for people who like to track details about their tasks. If you just like lists and check boxes. Todoist will probably feel like too much.  The one complaint I have is how they handle project templates. Oddly, the only way to create templates is by exporting an existing project to a csv file, or creating one in a csv file. You then have to manually import the csv file to create a new project. So every time I want to create a ""Prepare to go camping"" project with all the sub-tasks, I have to import a csv. and I don't think it can be done in the mobile app. This should all be handled within the app. You should be able to save any project as a template in the app and then create a new project based on a template in the app; and those templates should be synced across your devices. I really hope they are working on this. Dealing with csv files is clunky and not what I would expect given the quality of the rest of the tool.",
"Developer holds notifications as ransom for a monthly payment. Would be acceptable for a small membership fee, but I have to pay for all of premium just to get notifications, the whole point of a to-do app? No thanks.",
"Great app! It is very organized and can keep all your tasks together. The only con is that you need to pay for reminders. Personally, reminders should be a free feature.",
"Not sure if I did not do the settings right or what, but I never got notifications for this app, I got plenty of useless emails that I only check once a day. I had all permissions and app notifications on. Just not worth it.",
Best to-do.list app ever,
"Great experience with this app. I prefer it to Asana or Monday because not unless you have 100 member project management teams, this tool is simple, detailed, and to the point. You can even assign projects to be shared with certain clients or teams. I make my assistant's list for her and can see when things are complete. The price is right for a young entrepreneur or small business. The trouble is the comment section doesn't let me record my voice in Android or Apple phones. Great app",
"This is the best productivity app. Ever, it has simple and understandable UI, it sync across all platforms, it even integrates with my pomodoro app. I am enjoying it very well and i can endorse it to anyone having trouble make their day.",
"4/3/21 Looks like they don't listen to reviews as reminders are STILL a ""Premium Feature."" Thanks for nothing. 10/25/20 I was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms, but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this. Come on Todoist! Reminders should never be a ""Premium Feature"" in a task management app!!!",
"I love it, intuitive with great features in free version, It's not filled with ads or shady marketing, when it's done this way I might actually want to go premium :) keep up the good work and thank you!",
"Good overall. I'd love to be in able to change which time of the day marks the change between ""Today"" and ""Tomorrow"". I go to sleep past midnight, so it means my todo list shows lots of recurring tasks for ""today"" that are actually meant for tomorrow. It'd be much nicer to be able to go to sleep with an emtpy list.",
"no ads, rewarding task completion, easy interface, lovely organization :D",
"Great app, some annoyances. I don't usually review apps, and am only writing this in the hope that it will stop asking me to rate it after every single action. Having clicked no I don't expect to be asked to write a review again 5 minutes later. Other than that the app works as it should.",
"Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it.",
use it on the daily. simple formatting and can be adjusted - but not too many options that it gets overwhelming. very user friendly and they have great blogposts on their websites.,
"Very useful and handy. The simplicity of managing tasks pops this app out of hundreds. I'm enjoying using it and wheater you're a student or a very busy working-at-aoffice person, I highly recomend it. You won't regret.",
"I have been using it for years now, but the windows version is still not as perfect as Android version. When I open the windows 10 version of todoist, the app load takes too long",
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes t",
"This is an excellent list-based organizational app made even better with (near) seamless integration into Google calendar. ToDoist has replaced all planners/calendars I had, and I'm grateful for that.",
"Love it. Only tweak I'd love to see is when you have something to reschedule and you open the Smart Rescheduler feature, when you click on the item you can customize the suggested date.",
"Great app, helps me achieve my goals. When I neglect to use it my productivity drops. This app really keeps me focused, especially with recurring, easy to overlook, tasks",
One of the few apps i use everyday (and I have been for more than a year now). A true productivity work horse with an elegant and meaningful user interface. Todoist slips right into my daily habits.,
I find this app to be very helpful when it comes to keeping track of everyday things I need to accomplish and one off tasks I need to quickly jot down before i forget. it's easy to use and a great way to start organized!,
"Like many others, the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively. What used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks. It wasn't broken, why did you have to 'fix' it. I'm hoping they roll back some of these changes, if they don't I will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app.",
"""You can do eet!"" EDIT: Often crashes when using version downloaded from the Chromebook Play Store. I prefer to use the Chrome Extension do to its reliability and its hotkeys/shortcuts(?).",
"Really simple and easy to use, could do with a usable month calendar instead of just 7 days. And the option to set an alarm for high priority tasks/reminders",
"If you are looking for a incredible to do list, go no further. Todoist has made great strides since I first started to use their web app. Natural language additions are a nice touch.",
"Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be happy to pay, but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered. At least not for my usage.",
"This is the best To-Do app I have found so far, but it's missing some features I would love to have. Sometimes behaves weirdly, when you operate on lists with hundreds tasks.",
"Have been using this app for quite some time and I loving it. Would love it even more if at least some of the features that are for the Pro version made are made available for free. Please developers, if u r seeing my comment, please make some features like ""adding tags"" and ""adding colors to Texts"" etc available for free. Would be extremely grateful if feature to add colour to Texts is made available. Thanks. Please do it",
"Edit: Developers have fixed the bug and now this is back to my most used app. Definitely recommend it! Original review: Was a great app, suddenly completely stopped working. Will happily change my rating back to 5 stars when the bugs are fixed. Cheers!",
"Best to do list tool. I have 30 things to do every day but this app keeps me in line and I meet my deadlines. Between remote work, homeschooling, running errands and holiday shopping, this is so useful. I even have it on my laptop so to the team who created this...thank you!",
"best task manager ever, with this app, i always get the task done before the due date, it's also easy to manage and reschedule tasks. it's a magical experience altogether.",
"I love the simple, flexible interface, and that it's integrated with so many apps that I use. I just wish it was integrated with OneNote too.",
"I purchased this as a micro project management tool only to discover that it is incredibly restrictive and one of its functions. Its functions are absolutely incredible, but the problem is you can only raise so many tasks within a project? This is not mentioned anywhere in the spec and I would not of purchased it, because that’s the only way that you find out after you’ve purchased it, if I knew to only allowed 300 tasks within a project is incredibly small. So just a warning this is nothing b",
"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer. It was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option. But now I have to go through my hidden gift stash. Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time.",
"So useful, so great the way it syncs up with my laptop. Best to do list app out there for sure. Wish you could see your past tasks would be my only improvement.",
"It was a great app - until I got locked out of my account one day, for no reason, and lost all my tasks. Update: I reached out to Todoist support and they promptly replied. The issue was fixed the same day. Ok, I'm back on board! :-)",
"Very simple check list application, if you don't pay no teminders, no comments, nothing. Also there's no even taking simple notes stuffs. Just checklist and and sub task. If you want very basic, use it but tick tick ist best one. Sorry guys. It's reality",
"Great app. The best to do list app, hands down 👍 💯",
"Meh, it's OK. Same as Microsoft To-Do but you have to pay for extra features. Plus, you can't add multiple accounts and have items pull from multiple calendars. I like MTD better.",
"It needs far easier editing of individual tasks for more details, including bulleted lists and other tools. Just having an overview of To-Dos is insufficient in many instances.",
"Just migrated to Tick Tick - it's better with more holistic useful functionality and cheaper with free version having not that much restrictions like in Todoist. Sorry guys, it seems you have some work to do if you want to stay competitive.",
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it.",
Easy to use and keeps me on top of urgent tasks. Have mine set up as a widget and easy to see what I have to do each day. Works really well for the features I use in the free version.,
This app has the same functionalities on all platforms and adapts very well to the device you're using it on. Adding tasks is very easy with the button in the notification menu.,
"When you complete a task it disappears!! Not a good function - means you can't remember what you accomplished, and you don't get the satisfaction of seeing a big list of things crossed out (something list makers love!)",
"Its a good list app. But the reason why i give it a low response is that you have to pay a subscription to be able to use things such as reminders and alarms, which i need to be able to even remember that i have a list of things i need to do on a daily basis. Apart from that solid app.",
"This app is simple and clean. I have ADHD, and I forgot what to do without a to-do list. As a result, I have tried many similar apps. This app is far and above my favorite. It's simple and easy to complete or reschedule tasks. Love it!",
I todoist for time management and productivity. I have used it with small work teams also and the shared folders/shared task features are great. I recommend it to other and love it so much I became an affiliate.,
"As someone who isn't interested in task sharing or syncing, I find it insulting Todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a one-time unlock. That's just greedy.",
Overall the app's great! More like was...before the feature where one can't see the tasks in the subprojects was introduced. I actually prefer it that way. Would have been a 5/5 otherwise.,
Love it! Would like to see an option to keep completed tasks archived in the future so I can look back on when I completed things for work. Edit: Thank you for the response! Loving this all so much. Desktop version is amazing as well.,
"It works, but many of the best features are behind a subscription. I'd consider a one-time purchase, but the app definitely isn't worth what a year's subscription would cost.",
Very very difficult to understand and use this app,
wonderful todo daily goals...and weekly goals of the project work,
Super charging productivity. Best app in 2023 for me,
very useful tool to keep life orgnized,
Single Best Organising App.,
This app works great for me. Its even better after I smoke 👽👍,
Why on earth would a to do list app need you to make an account?? There is no reason for that.,
"I have been using it for a very long time. So far, I have not met better alternatives.",
"Use it constantly, love it, always suggesting it to people.",
very useful..thanks to all member who contribute for this app,
"Need a monthly subscription to manage a toto list? Give me a break. Went to add a SINGLE kitten and was told I had to update to pro to get notifications? Well sorry, but that kinda defeats the purpose. Some people have a hard time remembering the tasks which is why they use a list.",
"Really good app w nice interface and easy to learn layout. Lets u divide tasks by ""projects"" which i find really useful! Also gives subtasks, which also helps a lot. Would recommend :)",
"Great app! Todoist will send reminders that I have 0 due for the day. This makes me think twice if I really have nothing to complete for the day which that is not the case! So it makes me add task and by the end of the day, I got some things done!",
"I enjoy it for what its worth, with a nice interface and customisation, but basic features like reminders for tasks are subscription only, which defeats the second bullet point in the app description.",
"I struggle keeping on top of things, tried many different apps, this one is the best by far. a clean to do list, no pandering, just productivity.",
"I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead.",
"I liked the app, it was missing a few things but It was okay. I uninstalled it at one point, until I decided if I wanted to keep it, but I am still getting notified for the reminders. It is incredibly annoying and I can't figure out why... Edit: Thanks for the help, the problem is now that I don't know what account I logged in with.",
One of the best To-do list i have ever used. It has lots of feature which helps to work efficiently and effectively. I'm almost using it for 2 months and i really like it. Thanks You Developers for such amazing app.✌,
Has frustrating sync problems. Won't sync unless I have Todoist open on both devices. I've used Todoist for 8 years and it's the first time I've had this problem.,
The best ever todo app i have ever used... Helps me plan my week in advance and get things done. Love the natural language processing and features like projects and labels. Highly recommended to stay on top of your game.,
"This has been the go-to way wyeve managed my family's projects and errands for years ar this point. It's intuitive, works great on every platform we've used, and is really easy to use for both ad-hoc stuff and bigger projects.",
"There is a bug in the app. After i deleted one of the templates i got from the todoist app, it wont open anymore. I set up all daily routines from another app. This is very annoying.",
"Todoist is a great app for organizing your time and to do list. Easy to use and good reminders in email, not on going annoying notices like some apps. Highly recommend to organize your life.",
"Literally life changing app. Such a clean, easy to use interface and a great accompanying blog explaining how to use it well. I recommend it to anyone who will listen.",
"Room for improvement. It would be nice if subtasks could have different statuses in boards, and completing them could automatically complete their parent task. Nonetheless, this app is impressive.",
Best. App. Ever. I love Todoist. I've tried lots of to do list & project management apps but this one comes out on top. A few things I love that you can do: ●Create general tasks or lump those tasks under a specific project ●Flag tasks by priority level ●Add date & time deadlines to tasks & how easy it is reschedule/postpone as needed ●Brain dump details on projects I plan to prioritize later or work on as I have time ●Simple integration with Google calendar I'm a Todoist user for life!! 🥰,
"YOU TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT, Poindexter! No email is necessary to TRY IT OUT FIRST. IF a user decides to keep it, THEN they can create an acct AFTER TRYING IT OUT. READ FIRST before you give a pointless answer! 🤦🏻 Uninstalled as soon as I opened it. YET ANOTHER app that STUPIDLY won't let you try it WITHOUT an acct first to see if it's even going to work for you. ANOTHER BAD FIRST IMPRESSION..... NEXT APP!!!",
"Helpful, allows me to keep track of things very intuitively. I get a lot of ""brain fog"" due to my chronic conditions, and this app helps me stay on top of everything.",
"Have always found this one of the best apps in this category, but since the last update is now continually shutting down the app every time you update or save a task.....very frustrating.",
been using this for years now and it fits the best with how i work. never found a better app. some ideas for improvement - floating tasks (not meant to be completed but occur daily) - feature for making notes that change daily,
it's a great app in general. the Android version just a little less full featured than the web version. i find the interaction with Google's assistant a little buggy.,
"What good is a task app if it can't remind you to do a thing? I understand that the developers need to make ends meet, but reminders not being free is really obnoxious and prevents me from switching to it full-time.",
"Cannot get it to stop asking me to verify the time zone. Pressed yes, kept asking. Pressed don't ask again, kept asking. Pressed no, kept asking. Finally deleted. I'll use the the one that comes with outlook. It's not as versatile but it doesn't ask me to verify my time zone every time I look at it. Especially when I ask it not to ask me again.",
I use the free versions. Works well and syncs wonderfully between my Windows laptop and my Android phone. The Project categories are well used by me and I find the smart date recognition excellent.,
"Theres no other app like todoist in the playstore. Good job. This app was what I was searching for, it has everything that I need expect one little thing. If there was an option to add an alarm for the remainders, that would be great. I hope the developers will add it soon.",
Todoist works well to keep prioritized lists that can be worked through as time permits. Use Alexa to add items to your inbox. Later move them to projects or work them from your inbox. Lots of flexibility.,
Has literally changed my life. I use it for everyday tasks and chores. My husband and I literally no longer argue about what needs to be done around the house. I also use it as a grocery list as well so my husband and I can add things to it and when we go to the grocery store we just swipe of that we got it. Absolutely life changing.,
Does not sync well with the desktop's browser. Completed or new tasks on one do not appear on the other. Todoist is not much use unless I can use both devices.,
"Updates keep making the app worse for power users I can no longer type `3p` to make something due at 3pm when renaming a task. In fact, I cant find a way to assign a time to a task after its been created at all. If i do it the long way (assign time -> choose time on clock -> click ok) the time never gets assigned I can no longer type `p1` to give it first priority when renaming a task I used these features all the time and now it takes me significantly more time to perform these actions",
life changing. boards or something similar to the other to do apps would be good. not tried the project sharing either but that is a great feature i know that works well. widget on oneplus 6 is amazing.,
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.,
Incredibly helpful. My shortterm memory is trash and this app helps me keep track of all my random tasks for work and personal life. Love that it works seamlessly switching between my phone and laptop.,
"Useful, however some parts are not intuitive, for example its easy to think you've set a reminder when you haven't, because you didnt click the final OK.",
"I have tried other ""To Do"" lists before and this is by far the easiest ap I have used. I now combine Todoist with Trello and Evernote. Some projects in my opinion need Todoist plus either Trello or Evernote. Some jobs for today just require Todoist. Whatever I do I always use Todoist first and complement it with the other systems as and when needed",
"New update has caused a lot of issues with the widget. Every time I complete a task, it resets to load my list from the top. I need to scroll down every single time. Please fix.",
"This is the BEST to-do list app. I have tried many over the years and this is the one I have stuck with! It offers everything I need, attractive layout, and always adding new options.",
Todoist has helped me keep my life moveing forwared consistently by helping me organize my goals and acheive them. One thing is I am truly a broke college student and want the pro version functions but csn not afford them. Great app though!,
"Really helpful to track project with simple interface and easy to use. Anyway, it's not a variety of the feature but quite simple.",
App and its functionality are amazing. Really wish there was just a one time fee to unlock all of its features :( As much as I love it.. I just cant do a subscription...,
"After the latest update, tasks get duplicated and deleted at random. EDIT: for whatever reason, it stopped happening, I can't recreate the issue anymore. Soo ^-^",
"Absolutely amazing, it has no clutter and everything you need, excellent widgets to manage your work from the homescreen, it does what it's supposed to do really well.",
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month.",
"I'm only two weeks in and purchased premium and killing it (even more than usual) at work. I love this program! I mostly use it on my desktop but it's great for when I think of things after hours, am on the road with my boss or walking out he office door and someone throws something my way I need to remember.",
"I have been able to stream line my life and really focus on what means the most to me even with the distractions of 8th grade, moving states, and going to a new high school. I love the app!!!",
"I love Todoist and use it all the time! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish I could set reminders for individual tasks without upgrading to premium. That's the only premium feature I really wish I had. Other than that, it's a very useful app!",
Todoist is just what I need to manage my life. A great place to capture tasks as they cross my mind and put them on a schedule. Otherwise they go into the ether and never get done. Like how tasks also show up on my calendar and then on Echo Show.,
This app is very unsafe. They ask you to sign up with your email address and password. The sign up page is very similar to Gmail and may fool people into using their Gmail password. Any app that uses such tactics to capture your email sign in details cannot be trusted. Its is compounded by the fact that they don't ask you to confirm your password on sign up. Immediately uninstalled due to trust issues. Stay away!,
Great for keeping track of your life. Widgets make it easy to see your list at a glance. Just wish it would integrate with my windows calendar and samsung calenders on my phone and pc.,
"This has been great! Helps me quickly as reminders and keep myself organized! I love that the recurrences can be pretty random, for example: ""every 19 days""",
"Does what's supposed to do and does it well, I did like the previous UI more and would like a feature to swap between old and the new one, but it doesn't really matter that much still gets the job done, I'm only more used to the old UI",
"Todoist tracks all my required tasks, ensuring that none slip between the cracks. I would give it 5 stars if it had task dependencies and an easy way to download all completed tasks in one step.",
Generally very good. I have a few problems when I use it for reminders. working out what I need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging.,
Not only does this app help one in getting things done... It helps you as an individual to just get organized and you end up realizing that there is always enough time to do everything... I highly recommend!!,
"great app. very easy to use. even though there is a paid version, i like the free version. The limmits are some thing you can look over and on top of that NO ADDS. just perfect.",
"After I found out Wunderlist was going away I look for an app that could do all the things that could do as it was pretty much perfect for me todoist is pretty much as good, not perfect but for free I can't complain!",
"Used to be an avid user of the app, but now sync occasionally does not work with the Chrome extension. Both are updated to newest version.",
I have been using the app for about a month and let me tell you! It is so delightful to cross out all your tasks and seeing how productive you are throughout the day. It is nice that you can set deadlines and add tasks and subtasks to be completed. I am now contemplating going premium!,
"I downloaded and purchased premium for this app on New Years 4 years ago after being fed up of the slump I was in. Since then my productivity had improved significantly and my mental state immeasurably. This honestly has to be the best value for money purchase I've probably ever made. Highly, highly recommended.",
"Tried it, but have found some smoother apps. The dates (how the dates function) on the task list became way to cumbersome. Need something more like a backlog. A bit pricey.",
my husband and I use this app all the time. keeps us organized and on the same page. allows us to coordinate our grocery list and know what the other one needs! reduced marriage arguements by 25%.,
"Great experience! I love that its available on every platform, great job guys. I hope you'll add the feature to edit task like document (like Notes app of Apple) then it will be perfect 👌",
"I was a Wunderlist user until Micro$oft forced me to another platform. To Do is not the answer. Then I tried Todoist and I find it almost as good as Wunderlist was. A few more keypresses are required, but it is still very well done.",
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars.",
"Good interface, design. Could make it more interesting by using subtasks, a leaderboard, and motivational quotes and option to set constant reminders.",
"Initially it didn't let me view the shopping list synced from Alexa on my Android Smart Watch. However, as the developer says, if it is added to the Favorites, Alexa shopping list gets synced.",
Simply the best best task manager I've ever tried. My productivity multiplied. Thank you devs.,
"Works fine, but not very handy with active usage of one-handed mode gesture",
Simple and straightforward. Is very user friendly and has many ways to support you throughout a day. The only thing that I wish it had was a one off purchase price instead of monthly rates.,
"Add new task button is disappearing every time I start the app. Samsung Galaxy S8. Fix it, please.",
Wants you to pay £4 every month for setting additional reminders. Uninstalled.,
GREAT redesign! Really love being able to swipe up from the bottom! Gone are the days of having to reach with my thumb or using two hands. The change is very simple and easy to get used to.,
Love the app but it has recently developed crashing problem at startup!,
"This app allows me to be more productive as I have deadlines to follow even for the most mundane chores. I love the reminders as they help me complete tasks when I need to on busy days by reminding me to do them in the first place. Keep up the good work, developers of Todoist!",
Simply the best ToDo app I've ever used and I've tried a lot of them! Warm thanks to developers!,
Best app ever to come across It is simple and easy to plan hour by hour daily routine,
Amazing app. Easy to use and it does raise my productivity level.,
Love this app. It helps me organize my day to day schedule so well.,
"Almost perfect, exept for when it sometimes crashes in the middle of editing or doesnt arrange the tasks into subcategorie. I always have the process saved tho. Wonderful and functional otherwise",
Best listing app ever makes my mornings jobs so easy cannot reccomend this highly enough!,
The best app of all time for planning and scheduling tasks 😀,
Now reminders aren't working! Your trouble shooting guide did not help.,
"Simple and very easy to use, clean ui!",
App doesn't have any alarm system on scheduled time of task.,
"I have to say it would be hard for me to live without a to-do list. Todoist is a great implementation of that and I just use it for everything. Work, home, personal things, mobile, desktop, web Todoist is there to help me. Todoist team, great work, thank you!",
The app is very good. It makes more productive. The premium features are also good but one issue is that the price should be less for INDIA (INR). As the price is in dollars the price is high for INDIAN.,
It is easy to use and has helped me organize my tasks. Having it on the xomouter and my ohone makes it more accessible. Daily email reminders helps as well. Great app!,
todoist is the best. great for getting your life in order. it took 3 months but its now du riguer. the only thing its missing is the ability to do high level multi phase projects - i want to use it for my work,
What the hell !? It is indeed a good app for managing tasks but the most annoying thing in this app is that there is no reminder or notification for a task set at certain time. This is such a basic feature but this is paid in this app. Is this a joke? I've seen many people complaining about this problem.,
"Love the idea and functionality of the app but it consistently crashes for me. Luckily it saves the last edits made, however, it is still hard to use when it crashes so often",
"few bad part as a free user is it don't have windows shortcut to make the task from anywhere. another is there is no system to look the date and what are the current task on date... just like any calendar otherwise i really love sub-task, sub-sub task, sub project...this is really helpful to break a project into different parts",
The best app and desktop software I've found for my project/task management needs. I absolutely love that I can put several layers of subtasks into my project. Keep up the great work guys.,
"Have been using this app for a couple of years as my daily to-do list. It works well for that purpose. Would be better if one could embed pictures with items in the list, e.g. for shopping.",
Does exactly what the package says. Makes managing projects and to-do lists super fast and easy. I especially like the repeating lists feature.,
"One week in, so far so good! With the mobile app, the windows app, and the chrome extension I can access my list anywhere. I'm becoming a productivity master. Will upgrade to premium soon.",
"How do I take off all the auto generated things todoist adds to my list? It makes me feel more stressed when you add things like ""vacuum clean all rooms"" or ""check work emails"". How can I have a simple list that only I add to? It stops me from even opening the app, anymore. I hate seeing a list of tasks someone else created for me.",
"I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this.",
"Basic options locked from free app and only available under a subscription and marketing emails after just signing in with Google. If you just want reminders, as I did, this is severely over-developed.",
Awesome app very easy to use with in-depth features that have solved my should I stick with paper system vs going digital. Todoist is the one app that has made me make the switch and its great 👍,
Really good. Used Google keep normally but it's better since it offer automatic scheduling and rescheduling options. Rough time with tuition but when I graduate I plan to use premium.,
Great to-do list app! Does everything I would expect. The only feature I wish it had is to be able to log in to two different accounts and switch between them easily.,
sync between gcal was so bad that I wasted plenty of time waiting to add a single task. For almost half a year it worked fairly nice but that problems with sync today was enough to lose any trust for keeping important task on that platform,
"Fighting the input method rather than getting stuff done. ""Natural language"" will no way allow me to set a task called ""Register for 3 Oct SAT test"" for this Friday. Something simple as adding a note requires Premium. I'm going back to ToDo",
"One of the best tools to get things done. Easy to use, clean interface, synchronization across multiple platforms. Powerful, yet quick to master. Highly recommended!",
"The perfect app for to do lists. You can have multiple lists, transfer items between lists, and share your lists. I use it all the time.",
Super easy to use. I am a full-time college student and Todoist helps me keep track of what assignments I have due when. I honestly would be failing all my classes if it wasn't for this app.,
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.,
"They just added a 5 project limit. I now have to move all the information I had on this to another to do list. If you want any type of organization with your to do lists, this is not for you. If you just want a to do list and don't care how it is organized, then this is perfect.",
I dislike the update but mostly I dislike that it was changed and I had to look here to find out why. If you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when I open it. I am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration.,
"Great app, I use it all the time to stay organised! The latest update tho has made it so the text on my homescreen widget is white though, so I cannot see the text on the white Todoist theme.",
Mostly good experience with a few bugs here and there with reminders. I also like the API they provide that allows me to write some custom integrations for personal use.,
"I am satisfied with using this, but the task list widget sometimes does not work properly and freezes or works slowly, for example, after selecting completed tasks. I hope that the problems of the widget will be fixed in the next updates",
"Paying to see the completed tasks clearly shows poor pricing strategy. Charging makes sense for more advances features like... Collaboration, Repeat Reminders etc but not for checking you own completed tasks for a given day or week etc.",
"I love this app . It's Practical and useful . The project thing is soo good . I make projects like someday/ maybe , 2021 goals and routine.. Labels are also good. I would have been happier with one time payment. Make a notes app next .😃 Edit : For those who forget , put that big widget on your home screen 😎 Pls improve your widget",
"Love everything about this app and its functionality. Only snag I've ran into is my task items not updating to the correct times after daylight savings. Love that I can simply type ""daily at 4pm"" and the app knows what to do!",
"Makes it easy to keep track of everything I want get done, helps break it down and keep track of progress, and stay focused on top priorities until they are completed.",
"Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none.",
an amazing app that has really helped me get my life together and organized,
Great app. I am just using the free version. This app is a great place to put all the things i think of during the day that I need to do. Its super convenient to use. I also enjoy the karma part of the app that rewards you for checking off tasks,
"Reminders require pro (paid) version. Even then, there is no opstion to snooze at a different time. UI and UX feels confusing and non intuitive.",
"So far, so good. Love the encouragement in teaching daily goals. Shows overdue and can reschedule items. A personal assistant. With ADHD, need that. Less stress. Thx!",
Pathethic! you have to pay to get a basic feature such as reminders on your phone! Reminders should be free as it's basic core requirements for any to-do app. Happy to have switched to TickTick app with reminders etc all for free!,
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain",
Easy to use. Clean interface. Does exactly what a todo list should do. My wife and I use it to help run our small business. The sharing feature is wonderful.,
"No easy to use, all features I need like reminders and labels in expensive version ($36). Not going to put out that kind of money, when can't even figure out how to use it.",
"Good App. Unfortunately, some of the features that I would like to use such as the list of tasks completed and their analysis are in premium / paid version.",
Makes day to day tasks easier to remember and adding to the list is easy with auto recognition of date formats and tags. I can't say enough about how helpful it's been to help me get organized and make my day calmer.,
"Hate the fixed days off setting b/c I work very irregular shifts. Uninstalled. EDIT: to dev response - irregular means different days every week. Far too complicated to bother. Perhaps add option to switch this off entirely, ""forcing"" it just makes things too complicated.",
"Sadly this app is no longer usable. The notifications have stopped working and I am even unsure if this is a ""paid"" feature now. I followed all previous advice I could find from todoist and from general android sources. Either way after an hour or trying I have to leave for another app until the notifications start working.",
Everything is simple and convenient. But there needs to be an activity log or completed task section. Not being able to track the completed tasks is a dealbreaker.,
"Using this app for atleast 5+ yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature !! I mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but that's unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start. Goodbye Todoist Edit (after reply): So you mean, me & every other person who is complaining are all wrong. Reminders were never premium until some time ago. I was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan. Have courtesy to not lie atleast :(",
"If you like checking boxes off, this is a great app. You can create lists, sublists, and even nest tasks inside of a list. It's a great organizational list app.",
"The app automatically hides completed tasks, making it practically unusable if you want to be able to track what steps you've completed with out having to actively look for them every single time you move between projects.",
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS! I used it for one month, and now that I have gone through the cancelation procedure 3 times, I am still being charged. No humans to reach to, try to put in a ticket for contact, and all it is is a circle of ignorance an frustration. Again, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.",
"Thought it needed my email just for an account. Won't stop sending me spam messages to do my tasks! Uninstalled weeks ago and still sends me messages. Don't recommend this at all, would rather use Microsoft or Google tasks.",
"It's very very costly for individual use .Can you roll out premium for Individual and family plan, instead of only team of upto 25people support? This would make it worth for user like me who uses this app for individual use and not for team level tracking",
Spent a solid 30 minutes trying to figure out how to make a task repeat. Very unintuitive layout.,
"I used to have an issue with the calendar, but now it is sorted 👍 Now I cannot imagine managing my task without todoist. It is easy to use and it helped me a lot, thanks for the great application.",
I love this app and tried to buy the pro version but unfortunately I can't because nomatter what account I use to download the app or which one I sign into the app will only sign into the one account with payment problems. I wish I could sign into a different one to buy the paid upgrade,
"A really great app. It has a built in calendar, reminders, priorities and labels. It's significantly improved my list making.",
Great app! We share the shopping list. So it's easy for whoever goes shopping! Simply ask Google to add items to your list or add manually. I mainly on use the shopping tab.,
"Flexible enough to accommodate many styles. we share some ""projects"" across the whole family like the shopping list so we always know the latest need or if someone has picked something up already. Also great for organizing personal a d professional projects.",
"Turned around my productivity life, slowly but surely. It's all in how you use it: I recommend starting slow with a couple tasks a day that you already do and then slowly adding things you find you need to do. Clean interface and helpful karma system.",
l got it just for the connection with google assistant and have tried multiple times to get it to work with it but it continues to say TODOIST ISNT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW I am sooo frustrated and dissapointed. l hope this can be fixed l was really considering the paid version before l found out it didn't work at all with my google assistant or google home.,
My experience have been good. The app is simple and convenient to keep u on task. But it could have been better and therefore i have given 4 stars because I want a not to do list in this app to keep myself lazer focused on my ultimate goal.,
"I can't swipe right or tick a job as done from the options since latest update! what on earth have you done that for?! Now it seems I can only complete a job using that tiny, fiddley little circle. Not a good update.",
"Fantastic app; and the recent Foundations update made it even better. Great design, wonderful free functionality, good power user options, quick interface. I'm very happy. Thanks Todoist team!",
Great app for short-term and long-term checklists. Extremely helpful with task-activation and motivation when used thoughtfully. I recommend opting for premium.,
"It's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8AM or 10PM. If there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app, I'd give it a 5 star",
"Nice app! Even better in the premium option. However, I still have this phases when I don't fill in any tasks... My bad! But I'll try to become more organized, bc then todoist is a gamechanger",
"Useful, especially for setting recurring tasks (like watering houseplants, cleaning the fridge etc.). I love that you can set up projects to share tasks too.",
"I tried so hard but no. Grouping tasks as ""today"" in a ""Today"" list is not a clean design. I know there is some years of work on this, but app is becoming another Winamp.",
great for helping break down tasks and keeping track of progress. wish it didnt try to make me pay to set certain alarms weekly but I can always do that myself ig.,
"Great app. But I have a problem. When the phone is not working, the sound of a completed task is heard. And if I restart my phone, this problem doesn't occur until I open the app again.",
"They kept updating the system to make it worse and slower, eg instead of clicking I now have to alt click. I LOVE it when my external brain is proprietary SaaS that I get to rent but have no control over.",
What gives you as much flexibility as you need: + projects to grope tasks + lables + powerful filters alow you to create you personal views But: - it is possible to syncronize ONLY one google calendar!!! (which is funny as for Editor's choice app) - it is not possible to grope labels to set common color or search pattern - it is not possible to label a project so that all tasks created in a project get this label. I hole guys will fix the issue with calender otherwise all props do not worth it.,
"Ive been using this app for a long time now, fairly consistently and I find it very helpful for organizing. Its much faster and easier to make notes and get things done its great!",
"it's great! I can add all of my chores on their necessary dates and it always reminds me. as a scatterbrain who also has high expectations for myself, this helps me manage both tendencies.",
Used it for 5 minutes. This app does not have the ability to have your reminder repeat hourly daily weekly monthly yearly. It has none of that. How can you not have a repeat function? You guys don't think that people want to be reminded of things on a weekly basis or a daily basis or monthly basis or yearly basis?,
Was great until I switched to a Galaxy S22+. Now I get notifications up to 45 minutes late. Not very good for an app that should give you a reminder on time. Setting new notifications is wonky too.,
"Throw anything into the Inbox, to sort later (or right away) using Priority, Schedule (with reminders), Labels and Projects ""folders"". Set up a workflow that suits you any it's very helpful and simple to use!",
I like the design and speed of the app But some features are behind a pay wall that are very helpful ( but they need to get money someway right ) The only thing that i dont like about the app is that its not possible to schedule repeting tasks,
"It's great to have a separate app for todo lists that's always super fast, simple and reliable! Great features for organizing: time plan, projects, sections!",
"Todoist improves on everything I never thought you could improve on with Todo list apps. A beautiful UI with no gimmicks, plus features I didn't even know I needed. I really love it.",
"This app has really help me keep myself organised. The option to share tasks is also great - whether used for grocerie shopping, work projects or even holidays - it just makes coordinating plans so much easier! Love this app!",
"This has helped me become more productive than I thought I could be. The projects are immensely helpful when it comes to organizing what you have to do for what tasks, and it gives you a notification every day you have tasks, so you don't forget. It really helps productivity become more of a lifestyle, rather than a hobby. 5 stars!",
"Best to do app I've tried including original Wunderlist. Premium well worth it. UPDATE: Please increase the 300 task limit if possible. Annoying to have to fix at times. Plus being the premium version, it should be over that max allowment. Thanks!",
"Update 2: My question is solved for now. Thanks. I think it was just some delay because of holidays. Update:Ticket id 566206 I like the functionality of the app. I've been using it for more than a year. But: Do you have a support team? I created a ticket on Jan, 3d but my question is still neither solved nor even answered.",
"Love it. Priorities are here, tasks done are recorded, and just everything u need for a to-do list app. Thank you developer! Highly Recommend.",
"After recent updates. The homescreen widget stopped functioning. It would only work if app is running in background. If app is killed from recent sis apps, the widget stops working.",
"Very efficient app, a real time-saver ! And since the last update, a new widget extremely well-made and customizable : you don't even need to actually open the app !",
"Subscription required to set reminders? That's basic functionality for a To Do app. The app looks nice, and some features would be worth the subscription.",
"This app has saved my life at work and in my personal life. It's so easy to use, great interface both on phone and desktop app. Brings me joy and lessens my anxiety!",
It's a great app for the one's who don't want to waste their very single moments in this life. It's helpful in achieving goals and to increase productivity in your daily life. Thank you so much to #Doist. Keep moving forward ♥️,
"Works great! Multi-platform, great for establishing workflow and scheduling. Love it! Has made a significant improvement in how I manage my personal life and priorities.",
Sort by priority works differently now. It's only temporary and that's not what I need. If I add 10 new tasks with priority I don't want to change the order for all tasks manually.,
"Great app! User interface is smooth. Only minor gripe is that some options are a little more hidden than I'd like to see, so takes a little getting use to.",
Effortless to add and maintain tasks and to-do lists. I am planning on combining this with Evernote but Todoist often makes it feel like it's more than enough for organising my daily activities.,
"I just want to say thank you so much. My mental health has not been this good since I was a teenager. I am finally able to keep track of all the things that usually end up piling on top and smothering me until i feel hopeless. This is an amazing app. I have tried several other similar ones, but this does exactly what I need with such a simple interface. I wish the developers all the good fortune in the world!",
"Beautiful todo list app with almost all the features i need except for reminders which is only limited to paid plans. Overall, a great todo app with minimal design and excellent customer support.",
You have started making it worse. You killed the fun and satisfaction of swiping and checking off the task completely out of the screen by boomeranging it back while swiping. Looks like I have to develop a Minimalist To Do app on my own.,
"Great app! Would be nice if a note function can be added to any date as an option instead of task. By doing so, users can not only add tasks but notes of the day too.",
I purchased a premium but in the app it doesn't allow me to create more than 5 projects and it says upgrade to premium. This is rediculous. The funny part is when I click on upgrade to premium again it says you have it already. I want a full refund.,
Was sceptical about this app when someone told me about it but now it has replaced my notebook and I've converted to the paid version! Really easy to use and quick to add items.,
"Being a developer myself i use this app every day and its awesome. Email alerts, push notifications and more just make it sweeter. On top of that I cant stare at bright and vibrant windows all day and seeing that they took people like me into account with a dark mode is just awesome. Thank you guys keep up the good work!",
Only used it for 2 days but really wish I could see all the accomplished tasks that were scratch off. It's a basic to do list app and nothing more unless you pay for the premiums.,
Overall I like the app. However a large frustration is that showing completed tasks resets on switching views. Please add this. Visual confirmation is a hugehelp to productivity.,
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving.",
"Task apps have come a long way. Use across Mac os, iPad and Android. Really love this app, simple to use, categorise, file, date, action, etc and syncs seamlessly. Paid for premium student option",
"the app is good and easy to use. it will send you email reminders and overdue task. too bad for more useful functions, you will have to pay for it. but it is still useful as is.",
"Its really not clear how to set recurring tasks, which is the reason I chose this to do app as apparently it could. I've read the help guide and still can't work it out.",
"Great app, good at keeping you accountable and productive. Would be nice to be able to re-order your to-dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done",
"This is the best personal productivity app in the marketplace. Its usability is top notch, its design and flow is smooth and customizable. Its API is a delight to use as an integration-savvy consumer. I trust todoist to be the brains of my family life and even sometimes my career life.",
"Great app! So easy to use, keep everything organised with reminders so I don't have to think. The widget keeps me up to date with what needs doing today. So many great little features!",
"Support is terible even on paid subscription: due to some problem with sinhronisation with todoist's servers (it was writen in the sistem message in the app) I've lost data for the whole evening of planing for two weeks ahead. I have mailed to support (648200) - no response in 24h. So, since I have to continue planning things, now I basicaly forsed to redo all planing manualy without understaning the reason of the problem and any insuranse, that next time, I will need help, it will be provided.",
"An amazing app to plan daily & shleduled tasks, goals as well as projects. Easy & user friendly UI. Whether user just wants to note some random tasks or very specific scheduled tasks & projects; it's useful.",
"The best todo app in my opinion. The filters, search, available on all platforms I can think of, and ease of use. Thank you todoist!",
Easy and quick to use. An ideal companion for task management using the additional tools you get with the subscription. Thanks :),
This is a great app. One thing I suggest is time ranges. Im getting a bit frustrated with the fact that I cant make an appointment from say 2:00pm to 4:30pm for example. It would help to have time blocks to visualize my schedule. Would this be possible?,
"Not intuitive or easy to use. Has great features built in, but actually being able to learn how to use the app is very clunky and off putting.",
"I would really love to see a pomodoro timer, habit tracker, and a kanban board. The subtasks management could be better as it is in TickTick. I really love how Todoist have 2-way Google calendar sync.",
I love the way you can set priority levels for tasks !,
"Great app, but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder, it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder. I appreciate that, becouse no one will give you his work as a free. Ok, i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which I need.",
Super helpful. It's easy to add tasks to any category or sub category and assign them to an individual all in one step. Helps me and my husband keep track of what needs done and how busy the other person is.,
It would be so great if they add a calendar to this app,
"Very easy to use, I like using the widget on the screen and always write by myself the day and hour (which transform automatically by the app). Recommend it!",
great app! Allows to track my tasks very flexible way,
"Really, I have to try for hours to create a password to delete this app? And there is no way to do it.",
Ok so reason it's not 5 stars is because of one thing that I'd like as a feature and that is to change the colour of priorities as this would be an aesthetic thing I'd enjoy. Other than that extremely good for organisation and motivation.,
"My previous review seems to have been deleted. I don't need to have my schedule fed to Google. A sheet of paper is all that I need. There is even a GTD app in book form, probably for the same reason. Uninstalled, but that didn't stop the spamming.",
"USER BE WARE:if you want timely reminders of what you need to DO that you put in your TODO app.Per task notifications are behind a paywall! Bulk reminders in the morning and evening does not alleviate the issue.I need this so I don't forget what to do WHEN I have to do it!And that's what's happening,because the devs don't think that BASIC notification feature parity that every.other.free.app.has.should be free.Why even let me set a time!? +1 star for fine UI,webapp,and handy NLP ig. What a joke.",
"Buggy. Widget unresponsive, selecting a project overrides with inbox when you type ""everyday"". Sometimes.",
"Works great, easy to move unfinished tasks. why the 3? because they want 3 dollars a month to review completed tasks. there are others out there that don't charge.",
Really good app but recently iam seeing a lot of bugs like - when I am adding task it is not getting added . Projects are getting created randomly which is very irritating. Other than this it is 5 ⭐,
"Real useful to organise tasks by project so I can sort my work from my home, and I can also sort by priority, who it's assigned to, due dates etc. Glad it syncs across devices and can work offline too. I'm loving the widget to see all your lists from your phone home screen.",
"What a pointless app. I had to google how to set recurring daily tasks, and then it didn't actually remind me at the times i set. I'll get a pen and notepad and write an actual to-do list next time",
"It is a phenomenal app, I have just one suggestion, can you make the repeating sub-tasks not appear on the main list, it clogs up the interface.",
its minimalist style is so nice and simple to understand and it has a lot of options as well to organize and prioritize and various options to help you get more focused and your to dos,
"Very easy to use with a simple interface and plenty of features. The web version syncs with the app, and is just as easy to use. I'm more productive already.",
I had a bad time with time Management at work and at home. Now with my samsung and the routines I can get up this is the first app that wakes up in the morning. Giving me an opportunity to set up the day how I want and check them off as they're done.,
Easy to add and monitor tasks. Projects are a collection of related small tasks making the whole thing seem less daunting. Synchs PC to smartphone to smartwatch seamlessly.,
Amazing app. Keeps me updated with all the tasks I have to do and when they are Or will be overdue. Really like the project feature so we can seperate the kind of tasks.,
"There is a sort function, but each time i made amendment or add item, it will not sort automatically and i need to manually press sort again in order to have clear view of my outstanding item according to urgency.",
Great app for staying organized. I share it with my husband and we organize our tasks together as a team. The articles and templates are helpful for making the most out of the app.,
"Amazing app, the premium experience offers the entire app but even without you have enough to track tasks and the satisfaction of ticking it off the large list of things needed to be done.. To the devs, great work can't wait for any updates I'm a fan forever and what ever device I might get next will have this app",
"its really good. you can schedule tasks, and create projects and goals. but if you just want an app to remind you that its time to dk a specific task, you can do that too.",
"So far so good. I like the projects and sub task features especially. Only been actively using for about a week. Great for todos, not totally sold for checklisting yet.",
Pretty good. Sync to calendar not easy to figure out. Similar to Wanderlist but better. But could use some features like Microsoft ToDo.,
It's really awesome and very helpful. It would reach more and more people if the premium version is available at a little lesser price. Appreciate the Todoist team. Thank you.,
"This app is very helpful. And I have only been using this app for some weeks. And It can help me for everything I need to do in life like school, meetings, taking notes and more. But I just wish it had a calendar. But I still love it!❤️",
"***Update*** The app is working perfect on both web, phone app and Chromebook app. The AI is very intuitive and once you learn small nuances, it is the best To Do list / Reminder on the market.",
"The integration with Alexa is a big benefit. I can sit on the couch, think of my projects and dictate tasks. Next 7 day recap is available on my phone, tablet and PC, great stuff!",
"I'm really enjoying using Todoist so far. I've used lots of productivity apps, and this one tops the list for me in terms of organising my daily and weekly to-do lists.",
Awesome App. For first time in my life I feel in control. Projects is great idea. So easy to add tasks and schedule them with natural language processing. Big thumbs up for the team.,
"I keep this on the home screen of my phone, and look at it more than I do my daily planner. It's user friendly, easy graphically, and helps me stay very organized with all that I have to do for my day and work.",
"Good for small lists and limited organizing. A limited and greedy platform. An app that requires a subscription, but should use a sold pro version. Idk who pays for this as a subscription but they are over valuing the seevice.",
This is a great product that helps to keep my life organized. I love how I can add tasks and projects with ease and can mark them off easily as well. I would always recommend that people use apps like this.,
I'm using Todoist to organize all my projects hobbies chores and I even set up a task list for my next batch of beer everything from buying my ingredients to bottling. it works so great. I love the widget I can see what I have scheduled and check them off without opening the app and finding the task. Haven't had it set up to share projects yet but soon.,
"Really intuitive, much easier and simpler to use than some other to-do apps I have tried! I immediately upgraded to premium and it was very affordable.",
"Please fix the bug that automatically toggles ""reset recurring subtasks"" on every time I open the app! So frustrating to mark off ""chores"" (daily) & have 57 completed tasks repopulated as past due!",
"You have to buy premium to set an alarm for the reminders, otherwise it emails it to you, which is bullcrap. It also refuses to save a specific time for the reminder to be sent",
I *love* this app [esspeciakly as a Nerodivergent person] My brain doesn't work with traditional calendars cause there's no objective you don't finish a task this enables organization for my scatter brain cause I go in and check off what I'm doing when it's done so doctor apt gets checked off so I can avoid over booking cause it's in my to do list while also remembering the stuff thats not strictly timed just needs done,
Great app! I use it to keep track of work projects and my tasks for courses I take for my masters. The free version is perfect enough for what I use it for.,
This is a very good app for note taking but i deleted it because i found another app. When i unistalled it it still kept sending me emails saying that i have some tasks pending. Even after 1 month i still get emails. Please fix this issue,
A great way to keep track of honey do lists. We just had our first child and both my wife and I are mentally exhausted so it is easy to let things slip through the cracks. The shared project is great for us to communicate even if we are on different sleep schedules. I just wish there was a way to pin the current project to be the first thing that opens up instead of the daily view of the current day. Would definitely recommend.,
"This app is great, designed well, powerful and easy to use. I don't regret upgrading one bit. I think the karma stuff is unnecessary, but I'm glad I can just disable it. Keep it up. 🤙",
"Awesome app, but... Sharing is borked on Android 13",
"Just beginning to use it, as Premium, and I,m really happy. It,s, up to now, the only app of its kind which fulfills my label, filters, functions, etc needs and, wow, allows me to personalise them!",
"One of the first things you notice, Todoist app feels like it really DID have effort put into it by devs and not to just find another way or place to inject an ad in, but to make money by actually making the app GOOD.. it feels like the devs themselves DO use the app, it''s like they made it for themselves - usable and functioning, because they couldn't find anything on googlestore that's practically usable for task management, and then they marketed it because others probably feel the same. . That's what a good dev is - make product actually good and money comes flowing naturally, and you don't need to hide your guilt by excuses",
"Without knowing anything about the app it forces you to create/connect an online account first. After that for the reminder app to send you reminders, you need to pay for a subscription not even a one time fee. What a joke!",
"After searching through loads of Todo list apps finally found one that works for me, great interface, very customiseable, sad that some features are locked behind premium but works fine for free",
"I've been using it for about a week & it has some nice capabilities, although I wish there was a cheaper offer for premium. Also, some of the functionality is a little difficult to figure out, but you get used to it.",
"Completed tasks are hidden from the default view. There is no way to enable them. This used to be possible, but it was removed for some reason. Not being able to easily tell what has already been done defeats the purpose of a todo app.",
"Loving this to do app so far. Intutive, easy to use interface with just the right set of features. Would recommend it for your to do lists",
"Took a minute to figure out the terminology, but once I did, the literal best app I have on my phone. This is only the second app I've felt strongly enough about to take a minute to write a review. It's good. You need todoist. Period.",
"Not the most features, but probably the most balanced of the to-do list apps. Sync and speed are very robust.",
Some really critical features missing like start time support. I won't want to look at a task all day that I have no ability to complete until later. It needlessly creates a feeling of unproductiveness when you're list is larger than the reality of the tasks justify.,
Just on the basic unpaid version and loving it. Perfect to keep track of everything with baby brain right now. The paid version seems pretty good too and might upgrade once I'm back to work,
Pretty cool way to organize my life. Lots of options for sorting tasks into groups and having different colors to label priority. Really helped me get some much needed order in the chaos of my life.,
Not happy with this app. Saying that reminder is a premium feature and we have to pay for that. Then what is the difference between this app and the phone calendar app? I prefer to use my phone calendar app as it has all the features such as reminder. Uninstall your app by the way. It is useless.,
"shortcuts to quick actions like add task and search have disappeared in last version. edit: no response from the developers, changing the review to 1 star edit 2: developer replied with a link to instructions, which helped: log out and log in again. changed rating to 5 stars.",
"Removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version, and the price is way to high. looking elsewhere :-(",
"This app is so much easier to collaborate with my team(s) on deadlines, details, and new jobs. . I've used other apps designed for developers that are too complicated for teams in different industries. I set my boss up with this app and it's helped organize his freelance clientele so much. We can always be updated on new clients and a checklist of what needs to be done. Todist is now a daily tool in my personal life too. 👍",
The best part is it is able to sync perfectly with my galaxy watch 4 unlike many other Todo apps.other apps i tried they wud not update phone app when i mark a task from the watch.but i just wish the buttons & fonts could be a bit smaller.,
"Came here from Wunderlist. Seems that Wunderlist had most of the features for free that this app requires premium for. However, I love the smart-date feature and cross platform sync. Great app!",
"Superb app. Simple and uncluttered, but packed with features and versatility. Continuous improvement with incremental updates and tweaks.",
this app really helped me improve my time management skills and overall stress levels. I found writing even the smallest tasks gave me the motivation to keep going!,
"Good free to do list. I like that it's shareable so you can coordinate with employers/employees. Haven't seen any ads, so that's definitely a plus!",
Todoist rules because they stick with what they're good at and don't clutter up the app with a bunch of half-@$$ed junk. Todoist is not a Swiss Army Knife. It's a perfectly honed chef's knife and you'll use it all the time.,
The app is organized and easy to use. A good amount of settings easy to find what you need. Writing a note is fun because of the design intuitive.,
"This app has blown me away! Rarely if ever rate an app, but there are no ads, and the free version is still incredibly highly functional... Just so impressed- well done to the team!",
Best to do list app out there. I've used other similar apps but they are either way too overloaded with features or just too basic. Todoist has got the balance right.,
"Apart from the emails (which you can probably turn off), I really like this app. It helps me to set small goals for each day, thus working towards a larger goal.",
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly.",
"The best, most responsive task manager app I have come across",
"1) Why are you disabling enter key's next line function? When I click enter key, ""Next line"" does NOT come. So I used other apps to type with new lines by using enter key. 2) Now when I cut and paste the exact contents from another app, even then, it does NOT appear line by line. It appears as a paragraph.",
I'm boring of that. On every new update Todoist team fix a bug and at the same time it create new bugs. Some section task deleted after 2-3 seconds of their creation... Please help me this make Todoist unreliable...I'm a royal premium member for many months... Please fix it...And prease review well the code before any update... I will change my rating after the fix thank you.,
"To-doist has been excellent for keeping my busy life organized! As a graduate student with a part time business, an internship, and multiple relationships being able to keep all of my pressing tasks organized and accessible is absolutely necessary to me staying on track.",
"App used to be good, used it for chores and household tasks. Now the Today page no longer shows which Project and/or Section a task is listed under (I have a Cleaning project with Sections for each room). So now I have two ""Clean sink"" tasks in my Today page, and I wouldn't know which two sinks it's referring to. Master bathroom sink? Guest bathroom sink? Kitchen sink? Really annoying, I have to now click on them to find out. Bring back the label that showed each task's Project and Section.",
A very good apps. It helps me a lot when it comes into managing my time. I love the features where I can set time by simply typing at 8pm for example. Good job developer,
This app is sooooo helpful for me as a student to help me stay focused and productive. It gives little reminders to get you back on track and it's a must for any student or busy person,
"It just is amazing. Its simple, tasks can be shared and also the way you wish to use it. It does boost your progress with the points system.",
"I have all my notes, tasks and little informations there and I've not experienced any bugs or disappointment where they'll vanish of a sudden. I trust this app and it's very good.",
It hS to be printable to be fully functionable and interaction with Google Calendar would be a plus. But it hax to be printable !!!!!!!-- Must be able to record activities and call them up for verification,
"Company got ridiculously greedy and started enforcing some really dumb rules on free accounts. Sad that I'll need to find a new solution for todo lists. Avoid this one. They randomly unshared a lot of lists me and my husband had and even deleted some, so we just lost a ton of data without warning.",
Great app! I love the projects portion that allows you to organize when you have the time. Plus the quick task that sends tasks straight to an inbox.,
I'm completely hooked to this app primarily because of the ease of adding tasks using natural language. Also the organization of tasks is simple yet effective. It has become a must have for me within a few days.,
"I absolutely love this app. It's gorgeously designed, so incredibly responsive and just EASY. I've used a ton of productivity apps and this one is the best by a mile. Your design and development teams have done a wonderful job. Thank you!",
"I encountered a small issue with the app not working correctly. After contacting the developers, they responded within 24 hours that a fix was already identified and planned to come out that week. Awesome service!",
"Was great until last update, widget scrolling is not smooth, scrolls back to the top after full scrolling. Marking tasks complete is really laggy, mostly end up clicking the wrong task.",
"First impression: when sending (via share) an item from another app to Todoist, it wants to create a separate item for each line of text 😫 and the confirmation message still has the {count} placeholder in it 😂 Next, if you want to set an actual reminder for your first task, you have to upgrade to a $3/month subscription first 😂😂😂",
"i likd it but i think , u should not erase the entire task when its done. it should be in the app , in a done list folder . also , u should add a confirm button when.. we r going to mark the task done.. coz thers a chance of erasing the task accidentally as all it takes is a click",
"Almost perfect but unable to add tasks on top of the list. Tasks are always appened at the bottom, annoying! There should be an option to configure this",
It's a very good app. It helps me stay on schedule and isn't annoying about it. It also has a very good UI that doesn't look cluttered. Would definitely recommend,
"Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally",
"Borderline useless support. Came highly recommended and, in trying to learn about some functionality, I used FAQs to limited avail and then emailed. What a waste of time.",
"This app is moving towards the garbage heap. The free tier is a laughable insult now, it barely qualifies as a trial, completely unusable. If you're looking for a todo app, try elsewhere, like zenkit or notion. To top it off, the new android redesign is an unmitigated disaster. Steer clear.",
"great app. I would like a bit more convenient reminder system. For example, insead of having to write the reminder, we can have instant reminder options",
"Another simple app with a subscription plan... This is not the right strategy to attract more people... This kind of app should be a one time payment no more. Whatever the number of apps with this strategy, it doesn't make it a good one.",
"I absolutely love todoist. It is such a game changer! Makes my life so much easier, I would be lost without it. The app is awesome, very user friendly and straight forward.",
"Feedback: love this app. One thing thats annoying is that my lists don't get synced between my pc and the todoist widget. I have to open the app, and then it syncs",
Was 5 stars lowering to 2 so hopefully they see this - make the completed tasks section it's own thing again why would I want it merged with my existing tasks? Makes it very hard to find accidentally closed tasks or to look thru historical data. Dont think this change was necessary,
"Is there a way to rollback previous UI? The new UI introduces more clicks for the same action - which decrease my productivity. If I need to modify the name and due date for the same task, I need to save twice instead of one time(previous design)",
"Signed up for premium. Asked about integrating Todoist into my Gmail and Slack workflow. It took 8 days for the customer service to respond, just so they could tell me it wasn't possible. No helpful suggestions. No work around. They might have well have said ""hey thanks wasting your money with us."" What a waste.",
"It almost perfect, it is missing a selection tool, where you can select more than task and delete them at once, also there is no way I can turn a normal task to a sub task to other normal task",
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited.",
"In a world that follows the 80/20 rule, this app has gone well beyond 80%. Attention was paid to the details!",
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!",
"Seems pretty good, but totally crippled the free version by not allowing reminder notifications. What's the point without those? Not bothering with it.",
"to those who struggle with the checkbox and general widget issues (or other problems): google ""todoist 13.5 apk"" to find a verison that works better. latest version is completely unusable and destroys my wohle todoist workflow",
"Great if you don't mind paying a monthly subscription fee. Don't bother with the free version, even simple reminders are behind the pay wall..",
"In the latest update, filters don't work. Please solve this problem. Following the response to the original review. I logged out and login back and the problem is gone now. Thanks to Doist inc for the help.",
"Amazing product! no idea how i got through my weeks without it. saved my many times, cuz I'm forgetful and this keeps me organized with tasks, on each day, what priority they are.",
Very useful for capturing ideas on the go and reminding me I have to do them. 10/10 excellent functionality and speed. Very easy to use,
"I have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating. Before applying the update, I had hoped to find documentation about changes. Found nothing on the todoist website, no comments in reviews. Update is attempting to be pushed, where's the documentation????",
A great app for task keeping one of if not the best one available My only request is to have an auto refesh function for the widget as it wont update unless the app is specifically opened,
would be nice to have some things ability to set a time estimate for a task then show if time estimates for a day go over your working hours in the day or something. helping you to organize tasks and set realistic expectations for getting things done. would be optional to use,
I like that you build up a score as you complete tasks. The email/push notification options are helpful for when life gets hectic.,
"Quite a great app Keeps me updated, easy to work with and optionalize features such as the colour of the background Great for someone that can't keep an organized planner or too much to remember",
Free version is useless. I don't recommend buying something you can't try. Most of the basic features like reminders are not available in demo.,
"Reminders are a premium feature, which is what I needed this app for. It really sucks that I can't use reminders for free. I have to continue the search for a good reminders app.",
With latest version shared boards don't sync between devices. Update (2021-03-01) - for some reason now it syncs shared dashboard again. Great app very usefull.,
"Overall, I like the app but I think it can be easier to schedule reminders and the integration with Outlook does not work.",
"It's really nice but I wish the notifications were better, like for some reason I don't get notified even though the task is due. It would also be good if we can add URLs beneath the name of the task, so that we can directly visit the link.",
This app is changing my life. I feel so much better about myself. It is wonderful to be able to complete planned tasks and this app really helps to manage procrastination in a non-intrusive manner ❤,
The new widget made the app almost unusable for me. Not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way.,
Several features are limited if you don't have the premium version but it's still really useful. I use the widget on my homescreen very often.,
"It is the best To do manager I've ever used. Simple yet powerful, it elegantly helps me keep on track every day. I've been using it for years and would highly recommend it!",
The app is great because it's cross-platform solution and has a lot of useful features. My only advice is that the shift between projects could be easier.,
"IS THERE A WAY THAT I CAN GET A REFUND FOR MY FRESHLY RENEWED SUBSCRIPTION???? I have used this app for over a year and when my subscription came up for renewal, it stopped syncing accross platforms from my PC to my Android phone.   No solution! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",
"This the best and is very customisable at its every level. But I didn't like that blocked reminder for pro plans which big letoff, other integration should be reserved for pro plans but reminder should be made available.",
"The app sounded great, but the fact that the primary feature, REMINDERS, is a premium feature, is ridiculous. Don't bother downloading if you want a functional app.",
"I love this app!! It is very essential to my every day life!! I am a huge procrastinator, and this app is helping me break this habit for good! I also love the rewards you get for finishing your task as planned!",
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package.",
"Early days, but so far it's doing everything I wanted & looks to have plenty more potential. I love the calendar integration particularly.",
I just updated to the latest Android version and now no tasks appear on my filters. But it's fine through the web browser. This was very good before this.,
"Easy to use, quick way to and and organise your tasks. Support of filters, labels, subtasks, projects and many other options to help you get everything done.",
Great app but the fact I can't see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if I'm free on specific day in the future insteas I need to check week by week is a deal breaker although I did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible. Will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app.,
"Get Todoist to Get Things Done ! Over past few years I have used multiple applications in the market. I Some of them being.. any.do, wunderlist, Google tasks, Google Keep, Trello and many more. After trying all of them, I came back to Todoist and became a paid member. For past 02 years Todoist has helped me getting things done and ensured that I am not missing out on important task at work and at home. Todoist is very generous in extending premium codes even for already premium users!",
"I really like this program, it's been very helpful keeping me organized. the only down side is i had to get the paid version for some of the best features but i think it was worth it.",
"Great for organizing to do items. Wish you could reset due dates in bulk, and a few other features would be nice, but overall great app.",
"Exceptional organizational tool that syncs across devices & apps, & with calendar automated reminders I never miss an important task. Part of my daily workflow. Highly recommend!",
"Easy to add tasks, looks good, just wish reminder was a free feature, but that's just me being cheap ! Great app so far, working on making it something I use daily.",
"Has really helped me boost my productivity, app is fantastic. So clean and really easy to use. If you're looking for an app to help productivity via to do lists - this is it.",
The app is great but I just need one more functionality. The ability to add every new event on the top of the list automatically. Do this and I will buy the app.,
you should disclose that your app requires a subscription in order to use it and then one must pay for it every year for the rest of their life.... this information should be displayed on the Play Store page where you sell your app .... it is my suggestion that you come up with a fair price to get paid 1 time for your app ... then it's a worthwhile apl otherwise you're wasting people's time and participating an absolute greed ...,
The only task manager app for Android and Windows with a dark theme. I also like that you can choose to focus on either due dates or individual lists.,
Pretty decent check list app. I like how you can set up reoccurring tasks. I recommend it for anyone moving away from paper planners.,
"It's a very good app... 1. But, when I deleted a task from No Section in A Project, The Entire Project Got Deleted... When I Clicked on Activity log, very Few Tasks with The Project Name Got Back... Correct It if can 2. If I Add A TASK, If I click send in my keyboard rather than arrow key in todoist, TASK will automatically move into a no section column instead of where ( a named section ) I typed it",
"This UX is amazing. Unload your thoughts when you have them, organize them when you get a second. Infinitely flexible. Get it done.",
best to do app EVER . been using it for years . fast interface and looks fantastic . does everything I need it to. would rate 10 if I could,
"Latest update has fixed the irritating issue where when you completed a task a floating box appeared over your other tasks, preventing you from selecting them. Thank you!",
Finding myself using this app a lot more than I thought. I'm not a very stoic/organised person but the app keeps pushing me to complete the daily tasks I have set and that's good for this guy. Great app. Keep it up,
"I was so overwhelmed and stressed out at work all the time before I discovered Todoist. Once I started using it, I felt like I could finally be productive. There have been several times where I've started to feel overwhelmed again, and then I realize how I could use Todoist to manage everything. It always works. I love this app, and I don't know how I would function without it. I tell everyone I know about it.",
It's a great app but it doesn't work because it keeps crashing all the time so almost impossible to use the app Edit: it seems to be fixed after the update,
"Wish the app suggests emojis based on the task you write. But other than that this app is an absolute game changers for me, it is unbelievable how this app can integrate with sooo many apps like google calander, trello, edge, notion .... This is the best To Do list app ever.",
"For sure, this app is good enough, but! After a year of usage they added reminder feature to a premium access. Without reminders your app is useless. Thanks a lot. Even comments went to premium. Completely useless app.",
"Great for people that like lists, I have the free version and it does enough to keep me satisfied. I'm sure there's much more to discover in the paid version but for my use case this is fine",
The app and the web version are not in sync. It's been a few days. Task that have been completed on the app are still on the web version.,
"Horrible experience Your team is incapable of good UI design. A normal low end developer could creat beautiful UI. Calander view is outdated,and useless.cant get any information from it. Can't even see subtasks attached to main task in main view. Worthless, outdated app.is your CEO sleeping or has enough money? Such a stupid, outdated design",
Great app for tracking tasks! Love the scheduling feature. I just started using it so I look forward to realizing its full potential!,
No reminder in the free version. A great downside of not using this app. I've been using other to-do planner and never had to pay to remind me.,
This is a cross platform we can create many projects. So do list is a very useful app every day. There are many different benefits of this app. All people should be used this app and fil good life,
"There is a bug with recurring tasks. If a task is overdue and it is supposed to reccur on the next day (today), the yesterday task stays as overdue and new task for today won't be there. If I had completed the task yesterday but I did not marked it done, I will have to reschedule the task for today instead of marking it done. If I mark it done instead, the yesterday task is completed and today's task does not show up.",
Couldn't see how to set reoccurring tasks. Don't have time to mess around trying to find basic things. Uninstalled.,
Don't have an account with this App. Kept on sending emails to me. Kindly delete if someone has given my email id. I have nothing to do with this application,
"This app helped me become more productive; I set myself 5 goals a day and I love ticking one by one off my list. I find it really helpful how todoist does reviews of all the completed tasks, as it gives me an insight into my productivity pattern. highly recommend!",
Very intuitive to use and highly customizable. Love the integration with Google Calendar. Taking my organization level to new heights!,
"I love having a to do list and this app makes it easy to check things off my list, or move them to another date. So far I have just used the free version, but I am seriously considering upgrading. I would love to have a way to see my ""done list""",
"Best ""to do"" app I try, very intuitive interface. My day now is completely organized. Karma feature is very interesting and motivating. Thank you for this amazing app.",
Best to do list. Fav part is pin notifications,
"Great app. And love the multi-crossplatform intergrations like with google calendar and Momentum. Just wish the design was more streamlined, like Listberry, then I'll be more inclined to use",
So far i liked it if it were open source i might have added 2 or 3 features of mine as well with those features it would be all time best app for me for task management. I will change ratings when I'll get those features as well even though I am its pro user,
As some one who is extremely forgetful I find this app really helps me get things done. I like how I can separate tasks in a way that some of them give me reminders while other more long term project sit on a list I can reference myself.,
"Everything is good but I can't turn on the show completed tast option from anywhere please add it, in the next update. Edit: I want the ""Show Completed Task"" feature in today or tomorrow tasks also, not only for projects.",
"Thought it was only phone problem, but after changing phones a couple of times, app widget still gets bugged. There're times when tasks are suddenly gone, then i had to redo putting the widget. Sometimes widget can't be clicked",
"Great app. Totally enjoying the premium feature. But I wish sorting out the list stays as I set it, instead of changing the sorting out method every time I want to view.",
The automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes. It would also be nice to have a maps integration - I do not think it is there.,
It was slow to get into (lots to digest can get swamped) however now that I am taking simple steps onto it it is becoming invaluable. Looking forward to getting more out of it daily.,
Overall pretty good. Wish there was a way to skip a repating task instead of falsely completing it. The list widget is pretty useful.,
"Can't receive notifications from the app, reminders, overdue tasks, due dates all don't work. It was working fine before, but certain update broke it.",
Seems pretty good but most of the options that make if stand out are not available unless you pay for it. Splendo is cleaner and easier to use.,
An easy to use tool that helps you keep track of all those little and big things going on in life. I especially like it's flexibility for handling tasks that repeat.,
"This app has definitely helped me survive this semester. It's really helped me manage work, life and engineering school while staying sane. Granted I'm also using a calendar and a physical weekly agenda.",
I think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect! I find myself constantly going back and forth between Todoist and Google calendar to schedule my stuff! All in all a great app though,
Loved the free version so much that I upgraded to the paid version within the first week. I've never done that with any other service. Todoist keeps my family organised. Can't imagine how I ever got anything done before it 👍,
I like that it has both projects and labels and you can query across both. I like the dark mode. Colors are a nice touch.,
"This app is nice but I don't like it because it only works with internet and there are some options which only work if I pay money, I disliked this app only because of those problems. If this app not contain those two problems I have given it 5 star. Anyways Thank you",
"Really love it so far, wish they had something for repeated tasks...would have given 5star otherwise. Week 1 , very happy. #edit: Thank you for the response :). I applied what u said and it is awesome. Changing to 5 stars , would give 6 for customer service !",
I've used several to do apps. Now I'm a Todoist loyalist! Todoist does everything I need across every platform plus endless app integrations. I'm nearly a todoist grand master and I'm still finding more uses and tricks for greater productivity. Tremendous app!,
This is a really good app which greatly enhanced my ability to manage my tasks and keep track of them. I mostly use the widget and almost never open the app itself.,
This has been helpful getting organized for my job but it wont allow you to have 2 separate accounts that have nothing to do with each other. I would like a personal account separate from this one. I would pay the premium for it. My boss would have to pay the premium for this one.,
I was not into productivity apps as such because I thought that it would just complicate the whole process but this app is really minimal and has all the necessary functionalites that one might need. Perfect.,
"Good app, but it's constantly crashing these days. It's always telling me that it keeps stopping.",
"I accidentally click on something and the whole note was deleted,dint even give an option saying do you want to delete the Note :( i wrote so many notes on the desktop and accidentally clicked something on the mobile and everything was deleted, no option to undo? No recycle bin or anything. Atleast ask for confirmation, some undo option for 3seconds.Very disappointed. SIR IF YOU CAN READ WELL, I SAID I ACCIDENTALLY DELETED IT DON'T KNOW WHAT I CLICKED ON THE MOBILE APP. WHY NO CONFIRMATION",
I used to like this. Then the updated it to include something called in Inbox which is just ruining it for me. I dont need that its making it confusing to keep track of things. I will be replacing this with another app.,
"Amazing app with so many features to organize our tasks. Initially I felt the app had so many features, it's complex to use and thought this app isn't for me. But once I learnt and understood all the features of the app and how to use them I am just loving this app.",
"Really good. and has a very good widget. but I can't keep using it because you can't add pictures, drawings, or recordings.",
"its amazing so helpful I recommend it to everyone who want to be organized and have everything planned for the next day, week even month so u can know what to do at that specific time again it's amazing",
"Basic version covers almost all you need to manage tasks. The name of the app reads tasks and reminders, but you need premium to get these. Misleading",
Amazing application. I was already motivated to do a lot of things but it's just so easier to be productive when you put those things out of your mind and write them down. I really feel that I am doing more things than before. This app is for me the best Todo app. It really suits me perfectly.,
Suits my needs perfectly. Pretty easy to figure out. Even the free version makes it simple to organise tasks in a clear way!,
"This is the best to do app I can find. I love that I can set due date, priority, and project by just typing (rather than a series of a thousand clicks like with other apps). I highly recommend.",
"This app is great for productivity, however I've recently ran into syncing issues with the app and the extension on my computer and I'm not sure how I should fix it",
"Found that on the phone app, the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited (100 or 200), but on the computer version there is no such limitation. Other than that it's a good app.",
Hlw!!! Company there is bug in the latest version I can't open the app. When I downloaded the app it couldn't open and then after I reinstall it couldn't open I'm facing same problem as earlier so asap fixed the bug,
"Cant use it if notifications dont work. Wont pay if I cant full feature test.....lets take this Corolla for a test drive, we can pretend its the Supra you imagine it might be... but first pay us to find out where you were just imagining vs how it really works....lol. Too bad, genuinely need a good working product.No thanks, it always requires mindless divulging of my banking info, you cant have that, if you have a product you trust let me see it,if I like it,you can have my banking info. Lol",
"It is great, with plenty of reminders built in and works across platforms. I wish there were more gamification elements.",
Such a a fantastic and intuitive app. The level of complexity available for a free product is amazing. My productivi has increased ten fold!,
"Great sync and cross-platform - many layers of nested tasks, easy integrations. I've tried tons of these, an this is my favorite by a mile.",
"It's not a bad app but I find it too cumbersome to navigate, I would have liked a simpler display of tasks, visually and organizationally it needs work.",
"The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps.",
"I like this app more than any other task/list management app out there, mainly because it supports infinite subtasking. A hierarchical structure helps breaking down tasks.",
I use the widget quite a lot and I have found it really difficult to mark a task as completed. It requires 3-4 clicks on the tick button to mark it is complete,
Bought the paid version and added various tasks on desktop. Won't even log me in or load anything. Downloaded the app to access my tasks and shows nothing. I even paid for premium. Very dissatisfied and disputing through my bank. This is worst than free apps like keepnote. Seriously disappointed,
I have searched a multi-platform app similar to ios reminders for a long time. My search finally finished after discovering Todoist. Todoist is able to fulfill a simple requirements that no other app is able to: recurring task. Thank you to all Todoist team for such contribution,
"Excellent dynamic app, the first time a to do list has worked for me. Easy to use. Now that I can track my own performance, I just have to change my own habits ;-)",
"Great app, I'd recommend to anyone that has problem solving, and anxiety issues. It helps me sleep to be able to make todo lists for the next day.",
Love the ability to add anything I want and color code tasks for visibilty. Wish there were as many colors for tasks as there was for labels though. Still 5 stars.,
"Honestly really liked this app, was 1 of the top 2 out of several however the ""rolling"" daily tasks is what lost me. Otherwise, this is much a newer, bigger, better version of Google Tasks...which I LOVE as well, however it has no share abilities.",
"I love a list that someone gives me to complete, but making the list is no fun for me. Todist makes sense and allows me to throw ideas in the inbox to handle later. It helps me better manage what I could not...me!",
"WARNING RE THIS APP. Got Premium, followed instructions to Integrate w/calendar w/vpn active, got security alert minutes later that an attempt was made to login to my email account w/my password. Had to hustle to protect my account. Thank you Google for superb alerts, shame on you Todoist for open back doors.",
Some kinda scam to collect email address.,
"And once again, here we have another app that gets worse with every update. Over complicating things. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I get what they are trying to do, but it has made it less user friendly and more restrictive. I wish I could revert back to the previous version. Currently considering going back to the previous app I used to use.",
Widgets are so huge (4x2) that they are unusable. I wish i had an option to use smaller widgets. I have tried another to do app and it had much smaller so usable widget.,
"This app so far has helped me to be more active with the days that I'm granted. See, I'm doing this thing called ""80/20."" I'll get my work done and go reward myself for completing my daily goals. This app is exceedingly productive and keeps you motivated with the Karma System.",
Simple straight forward functionality and compatible across different devices and browsers. I use it everyday and love it.,
This app is constantly having notification issue. For 6 months this issue would come and go and now it just stay. What are you using your subscribers money for if you're not going to properly fix the problem? I will not use todoist anymore.,
"Wonderful app i can't say how much I love it ❤️ A note for the developer: please add the time for the task Often times tasks are the works that need to be done.but todoist lacks one key thing that is asking the user ""How much time do you want to do the task like 10 or 30 minutes"" It's a really big problem when you look at your time blocked calender but see a half hour work which would take 2 hours :mostly by todoist Other than that i could have given it 5❤️",
"Really like the app, but I've found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view, for some sections the tasks don't appear and the ""add another task"" button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position.",
"🥰 Smooth, versatile, effective. Syncs perfectly with Google Calender. Honestly the best to-do app I've tried (after much searching). I'm sooo organized 🤯💫🤑 might go pro... 😳😳😳",
"Nice interface, good help, good configurability. Integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though.",
Good for project management by related project and task lists. However when subnotes are needed a seperate notemaking application is necessary. The user interface is not made for making extended notes on projects and tasks.,
I really dislike the projects thing. Just let me make new lists. I want a list for movies to watch another for gift ideas etc. The best way to do that through this app is subitems which are a pain to deal with. Moving over to wunderlist,
Really love this app and so happy that my previous feedback was acknowledged. Only reason not 5 stars is my widget has stopped working. The widget is essential to keeping on top of my tasks! Please fix soon!,
"easy to use and works over many platforms. i like that there is a community of users and tutorials to help you maximize its utility for what you need. i also enjoy the karma feature, which gamifies productivity and helps me stay motivated",
"Pretty easy to use, once I put it into my routine, no problems with multi-device sync, works perfectly between my phone and smartwatch!!",
"This app is brilliant! I prefer quicky typing my TODOs with date & time, rather than picking it using the controls, and it does a beautiful job in processing my text.",
Putting REMINDERS behind a paywall pretty much means you're forced to pay for the app to get much use out of it,
"It works great. Using the free version to get to know it but I'm liking what I see, do, and get done. Update: The app is still going strong. It faces you with all the things that needs to be done. Scary but realistic. Didn't expect to get this much done by simply using an app.",
I feel so much more organized with this app. It helps me plan and prioritize my day and stay on track. I feel like I get more done and don't have things nagging at the back of my mind that I need to do because I've got them scheduled through todoist.,
"Very easy to manage tasks. Just don't know how to set to receive notifications for all tasks into project, not just for tasks assigned to me. Good job.",
"Really? You make a calendar/planning app and the force people to pay per month for it to have any form of reminders, even just local push notifications? Sorry, everything this does in Pro can be done with Google calendar for free.",
"Fast, intuitive, great sync times and seamless integration across platforms. recently discovered the team collaboration options and love them too!",
I found that the several tabs was unnecessary and prevents me to be productive. We have to pay for an app to get reminders. I'll rather use an app with ads if the reminder function is gone,
"A lot of basic functions are limited to a paid premium membership. Better off using a free app that doesn't restrict functions to premium users. Also, a karma level...? What? Like anyone needs some ridiculous feature like that. Sure... you give THAT to free users.",
"it keeps me remind of what I needed to do on the day, and the days that follow. planning helps to execute your days accordingly, without wasting any time one things that weren't part of the plan. that's when you'll notice the distractions. All in all, I like it.",
I've tried to use to-do list type applications before. I see the benefit in them. But they never really stuck with me. The customization and organization options in this app make it great. I use it daily.,
I added a bunch of stuff to the schedule and went to check it the next day and all of the data was gone. I deleted the app. Useless.,
Useless. Installed this and got partner to install. Not possible to share projects. Help section describes clicking on something that isn't there.,
"I decided to try this app out before work on a Sunday. The app immediately said ""enjoy your day off you deserve it"" but it was not my day off and I could not edit it, so I just stopped using it.",
"Overall, it's pretty darn good. The only problem I have with the app right now is that the crown doesn't work for scrolling. Please integrate this simple feature for five stars.",
Really great app is very useful and easy to use. It gives me reminders if I don't finish something and I can set reminders for future things that I need to get done.,
Would be even better if there is an option to make multiple lists on the dashboard itself to make it even more convenient to use.,
I love how simple and yet powerful Todoist is. I recommend anyone at least try it the app and try the premium trail.,
Seems great but setting reminders is a premium feature... I'm not sure how a basic function of a list app can be a premium feature. Not worth it.,
Microsoft To-Do is WAYYYYY more user friendly and has tons more options. Including list sharing. Which I use multiple times per day.,
Best To do list app out there,
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.,
"Almost perfect! If there was the option to only share specific sections instead of entire projects, this app would be perfect.",
"Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks.",
"It's alright, nothing bad, not perfect. Can't give perfect score partially out of principle, but would give it 4.7/5.0 there are some minor complaints but they are minor nitpicks.",
Shared projects no longer sync among users. Their workaround of leaving and rejoining does not fix it. Without being able to sync this app is pointless.,
The right balance of simplicity and power for me and my partner. I love the quick entry method and Google calendar sync.,
Excellent tool for simple project planning. Lacks one feature that would make it 5*. Ability to add notes (usually form ideas before converting to tasks).,
I wish it would give me notifications on what I have to do,
Very very very very very very verrrrrrrryyyyyyyy baaaaadddddd apppppp 😡😡😡😡😡😡,
Please add a student discount,
Recurring reminders removed?!,
wish I could enter a to-do easily without having a specific date assigned to it automatically! otherwise the app is slick and very useful.,
Excellent and very straightforward and easy to use especially now Boards (kanban-style) are here. As I am very spatially-oriented this is ideal for me.,
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.,
"Nice app, would be better if I can see the tasks that I've completed. I know it's in the paid function but it's too much of an important function that we are missing out on.",
"Having the ability to put my tasks in regular sentences and having todoist understand when and what I'm trying to remember is so well done I haven't used Google assistant for reminders in weeks, I also love the widget the app has built in",
Does not integrate well between all applications. The interface w/ outlook is horrible. Ability to set up task groups for shared tasks lists is lacking.,
Worst most useless app I've had the misfortune to try. Literally zero point in having this over Google calendar. Don't waste your space. It's useless. You can't have recurring tasks& everything is behind a pay wall. Avoid.,
"Great app but setting the times and dates in dutch doesn't always work very well, for example if you type 'half 3' it thinks you mean 3:30 while it's actually 2:30.",
"Very customizable planner, easy to navigate, but not basic. I love it. Thanks to the creators, you guys really did a nice job.",
Makes managing your to do list on the go quick and easy. Excellent feature parity with the web and desktop versions too!,
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part .",
Love that we can share work on a project and assign and schedule tasks and subtasks. Each person sharing the list can see when items are checked off. Very useful.,
Used Todoist for years now and it is essential to manage my busy life. I list even the most mundane tasks. Never lets me forget. So reliable! Wonderful!,
It'd be 100% if it would notify me of my list on the day at a specified time. I believe I seen this option but you have to pay. That does not make it a free app after all. Other than that its a decent app.,
I've tried many different apps and this is the one the has worked for me! So simple but very powerful and love that it works seamlessly between my phone and desktop.,
Can sync with Mac and Android but very Disappointed with this app. alarm/ reminder does not function. This should be included. Have to pay for it to function.,
"Best app for keeping track of clients, jobs and bills. Looked a long time for something like this. It's great for tasks too",
"First google result described todoist as a great free reminder app. They failed to mention you have to pay a yearly fee to receive any reminder notifications. Which IMHO, is absurd",
It's really useful to be able to write down tasks and reminders in my phone. Todoist is good for keeping it organized.,
love this app! I have used so many task apps in the past and none compare to this one. its easy to add things to yet keeps everything so organized and easy to find.,
"I love this app a lot. You can organize your short term and long term goals, and set their dates, whether they're a one time thing or something you do weekly or yearly.",
"Fantastic free features, good multi platform support. For a free app for me to get started with planning, I really can't complain.",
"Very useful, the paid version is worth every penny if you like to keep your lists organized and across multiple devices.",
"This app is great for managing tasks in a hectic schedule. It also keeps a log of the time and date each time was completed, this is great to check how you are managing your time! Definitely check it out!",
"Was initially sad that Wunderlist got shut down, but so happy to have discovered Todoist instead. I like it even better -- it is smart but also simple and not overwhelming. Wonderfully designed.",
opened up the review box while i was trying to check off some stuff. go away,
"work for a while then stopped syncing fixed it then it stopped working. same thing happens a third time. researched the problem. turns out ALOT of people had rhe same problem. they switched to any.do, so did i.",
A blip after recent update but now loving it again.,
A great app but the subscription based fee for all functionality is not good value and prevents many from committing. A one off cost would be much better.,
I have used to do list managers both paper and software for almost 40 years. I have researched ad nauseam. This is simply the best I've ever used.,
Really helps me to keep on top of my uni work! The ability to add projects and colour code really helps and using it on all my devices means i can always stay on track.,
"Linked across all my devices, and categorized into projects and tasks and can categorize priorities by colour and with reminders linked to my calendar. Great for productivity. Top app",
Super intuitive and simple to use. Good widgets. Actually increases productivity rather than frustration because it works.,
It's one of the first times when a free options has almost everything I need. It has a clear and pleasantly looking design.,
"Exactly what I needed...easy to use, non invasive reminders, simple to make changes as needed. I am an older person and the help this gives me is great!",
I love Todoist! It is an essential tool that keeps me organized while on the go. Simple and intuitive. I've recommended it to family and friends.,
Really enjoying this so far. Easy to use and helps me keep track of what I need to do. I work for myself and have lots of things on my plate so getting things out of my head and onto the app helps with that horrible feeling of overwhelm.,
"This app helps me manage the many things I have to accomplish in a day. The interface is simple and clean. It's easy to use, not too many bells and whistles, but enough features for day to day use.",
"Good app, just wish you were able to back date a completed task so I can use it for tracking habits as well, but it's a to do list app and works well.",
"Love this app. Makes life so much easier to keep organised, especially being able to sync across several platforms.",
"great for dumping all the tasks on my mind into one place, then i can easily drag them in order of the easiest ones first, and then blast through the tasks one by one.",
"Awesome organization tool, simply the best!! I had always struggle with sorting and rescheduling tasks, which in this app is done with ease A+ I truly recommend you give it a try",
My task manager of choice both personally and professionally. It's feature packed and provides timely reminders to ensure I'm staying on task.,
Just started using it....the interface is easy to learn and the amount of detail is just robust enough to be appropriate for what I do.,
Please add an option to delete all completed tasks together. Although we can hide deleted tasks but its better to permanently deleting completed tasks after some time and then using the hide feature as a recycle bin. Other than this It is a great app.,
"This has become a part of my daily routine. Can be used across devices like phone, laptops, desktops with auto sync. Also can arrange tasks in personalised groups.",
No reminder options for free version of this app. How can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for. My alarm clock would be better than this app. Sorry I don't recommend.,
Paid experience is better than free. But it will do since there are no ads. UI and design can be made note clutter free.,
Widget constantly breaking. Not updating and showing a loading icon at bottom. Defeats the entire point of having a widget easily viewable.,
"so easy to make custom recurring tasks, assign categories to them, add alerts, add notes, assign priority levels, etc. the premium version is totally worth it!",
I love this app and I haven't fully explored all of its abilities. It has kept me on point with a few things.... and I love the reminder function.,
A great tool for someone who want to boost up his productivity! Everything that I need from a todo list application is already implemented. I would definately recommend trying it out!,
"Very helpful and easy to use while being user friendly but not overly simple. Perfect for lists, projects, calendar reminder and simple side notes.",
"It's nice to set mini goals, complete the various tasks and check off those boxes. It's easy to use and convenient.",
I'm using the free version and it's fantastic. A great way to hold myself accountable and organize my tasks. I might even pay for the premium version!,
"In the parlance of our time, this is the G.O.A.T. to do list app. Especially for Android. Especially if yoy use Outlook for work. 12/10 would to doist again.",
"Reinstalled, still have incorrect list updates compared to my gf, which then results in incorrect groceries every freaking time. This after months. Time to find an alternative app now.",
Loved it! The best part is to be able to sync on phone and pc. Pretty easy to use and amazing UI.,
"Absolutely incredible. Thank you so much for creating this app. Its helped me progress foward each day with my work, my podcast, my 5k jogging goal and most importantly raising my son. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work",
"The best to do app, the repeat task after a certain time period is my favourite and a unique feature that lacked in all todo apps i have tried. Kudos to team Todoist",
I really like this app. It usually works flawlessly. But yesterday sincyng with Google calendar simply stopped working for no apparent reason. That was one of my favorite features and now it's gone.,
One of the simplest to do app which could be practically put in use out of so many organizer apps gone through myself. Would have given 5 stars but simply an alarm demands a lot of money from you.,
It does a beautiful job at helping you use their app through their website and other tutorials. It makes you soooo much more likely to stick to using it than other apps.,
"Simple, easy to use. The goal setting option is really helpful. It encourages you to stick to your plan and to do your tasks.",
"Hands down ths best task app. i used many and stuck with Todoist. The app is not without draw backs, frustrating sub task management and start date work arounds.",
Wanna love this all BUT it's half ruined bc they force all Overdue tasks to the forefront at all times. Overwhelming! I keep acting avoidant towards the app bc of that which defeats the purpose. Cant turn it off,
love it! I have way too many to-dog's on my list and it's easy to reschedule them at the end of a due date. also like being able to break down by project and priority.Yes,
"This app is really helpful. Earlier,I thought that to do list apps were useless and were a total waste of time. But this app is a real time saver. The reason is that earlier I had to think what I have to do and need to do in my mind, but now I can write in my to do list and get stress free",
Widget working again (not refheshing constantly),
"Hi,  I am using Vivo V5 Plus handset. I had downloaded ""Todoist"" for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work, if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen.  Kindly help me in this regard.",
Tried and loved Any.Do until they billed we without giving me notice or me even signing up for a paid plan. I'm glad it happened though because it allowed me to discover Todoist which is a much better and more complete app.,
Generally good app.I've been using it for a year now. It would be great if they could have a calender view of activities and a promodo timer.,
"Absolutely brilliant for keeping tabs on your tasks and timelines! Great Project Management tool, plus it motivates you daily as well.",
"Please ad an option to turn off check boxes on the widget. Since it was added, I'm constantly checking off items by mistske. Once you do this, it is tedious to get the item back.",
It's very easy to accidentally complete tasks and the only way to undo an accidental completion is behind a pay wall. Instant one star,
The app became unusable recently. When moving and changing the tasks the ui won't update. This service workout a reliable app is useless.,
"This is the first result when you search for ""reminder"" apps. ""Reminder"" is in the name. However, to give yourself an alert is a premium feature. Hard pass.",
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated",
"Excellent, very useful with a smooth powerful and intuitive interface. It's a must to keep my daily tasks on track",
"So far I can't complain. It's been reliable, helped me keep focus on my daily goals and the feeling of accomplishment from closing all tasks is truly something. Keep up the good work.",
this is a great app to keep me organized. I can access it on my phone or tablet. recent updates have improved the flexibility to reschedule tasks.,
Great! Was super easy to import my lists from Wunderlist and a bonus to have 2 months of premium. Seems rich in features and I like the design.,
"Replacing Franklin planner, so far so good. Still need my Google calendar to look more than 7 days out. May have to upgrade to access reminders.",
Love it. I'm actually getting things done! It takes a little bit of learning to work out how to make recurring tasks etc but once you do it's all there. (Free version),
"everytime the app gets update, i receive ALL PREVIOUS NOTIFICATIONS.  // Edit: I am sorry, but, I do not have time for that. I am using lenovo P2, it happens every single update. I have just had it again and app is no longer on my phone.",
"Pretty straight forward apps, it just make a list of the thing you have to take care. Simple, not too fancy, or complicated.",
"This app is amazing! It looks so simple, but at the same time it has so many features that makes things easier to plan. Definitely love it! If you're trying to organize your life, this app is the answer 😎",
Great free experience! I can organize my to-do lists into projects with subtasks. It's almost like a sprint board for my life.,
"Best task manager I've used, only thing I'd like to see is moving the sorting on the widget to a drop down in the top bar, rather then it taking up space where the tasks show up.",
Simple. Clear. Unobstrusive. But alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view.,
"Never uninstalled an app so fast. There is zero point to this app without reminders which you cannot do without a pro subscription. You need to pay 4 dollars a month to get a notification, what a joke.",
Very easy to use. Includes helpful widgets which let you easily add new tasks and see which ones you still need to finish.,
"Great gtd implementation. the are a few keyboard shortcuts that don't work as expected on the web version. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars!",
great and easy to use for both day to day tasks and long term things. This app has got me back on track and more productive. also a great feeling of accomlishment with all you get done.,
This app works very well. Adding new tasks are easy and it syncs seemlessly between devices. Can highly recommended it.,
"I've actually used this app for a long time off and on. it has some great features, some of which are premium. But even the free app is one of the best todo list apps around.",
Absolutely amazing app and seriously have nothing bad to say. I wish that we can get more perks as we use the app and its features more to encourage us to mange our time wisely,
"Reminders and notifications should always be there with the free version, can't think about a to-do app without those basic features.",
"The some part of the app is glitched and the completion sound plays randomly throughout the day. Edit, reinstalling fixed it.",
"I really appreciate the ability to schedule recurring tasks, reschedule easily, prioritize tasks, and easily identify the due date with abbreviations like ""every sat"".",
It is strange that I'm no longer able to share text/link from other apps to create a new task. Please investigate. Edited 27Aug: This has been fixed. Thank you!,
"It's a useful app but I wish their was a way to actually see the calender, or to like see the dates you have stuff on with out having to like check them off. Other then that it comes in handy.",
"This is the better app to organized my personal issues and professional work. Simple, easy to use and amazing features to keep me organized.",
"My Favorite Productivity Tool! I don't know how I would capture and accomplish all the tasks life throws at me without Todoist. Coming up on 2 yrs of premium subscription, worth every penny to me!",
"Works great and the price is right! I started using it with IFTTT and Evernote, and have almost dropped Evernote. This does what I need without the extra stuff.",
"It has everything that it claims but I do not think that this app is for my own needs. I uninstalled the app a while ago but now, now I have frequent emails from the developers and has become rather irritating. Is there anyway you can stop these emails?",
"this is a really great app for organizing thoughts, projects, and other needed things. easy to use and really visually appealing.",
Super handy. I use it all the time. The free version is great but i can imagine you might want to pay for bonuses like reminders,
"A decent app that helps a lot. I can see and check off what I need to do, and what I have completed. It helps me plan projects in advance with more detailed lists.",
"Only about every day reminder i rate 5 stars. Other apps can't cause Android powersave system. This app has a trick or something, and it keeps me remind. Thank you!",
"Starting grad school on top of working a part time job, balancing writing a novel and hosting a bimonthly podcast, rock climbing, and trying to maintain a social life, and also just household chores. Can't imagine what i would do with out this app.",
"Great app. Decent interface. However, some features are available only for premium user. Though overall its great :)",
I've been looking for something I can use for recurring daily tasks and the ease of use in Todoist is great. It's helped a ton with my daily organizational needs.,
"Just discovered the section header function so the app finally makes sense to me! would be good to have a daily summary in the morning and then a ""catch up"" notification in the afternoon to remind you to tick off tasks",
I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom. SOLVED,
I am not an organized person. I bought this to help remedy the situation. Has it solved all my problems? I don't think an app can do that. But it definitely makes me *feel* organized and on top of things so I'll give it 5 stars for that!,
it's a good app that helps you to organize and priorities and schedule your tasks plus some other cool features but you have to have the premium version.,
Probably can do a lot more than I'm using it for but finding it very useful to compose my daily to do list for work. Easy to change order of tasks which I like.,
"Overall a good experience. I think the price is too much for what they are offering, but it is by no means a bad product. Since it was too much I asked for a refund and they did it with no hesitation. My regards to the Todoist team",
"Can't add new tasks on mobile app anymore. Not sure if the app had a bad update or what, but now when I hit the +Add New Task button on the android app it just looks like I'm clicking it but the new task window doesn't show up and no keyboard shows up. I can only add tasks through desktop version on my computer. Please fix. I already tried uninstall and reinstall",
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.,
This is my new favorite to do list app! It's got everything I need and want. my favorite part is that I can prioritize and schedule tasks and it integrates into my calendar.,
"The easiest, most intuitive way to get organized ever. I was obsessed on day 1 and had my team onboard by day 2. Total lifesaver.",
"Just works. The UI is sometimes a bit crowded, but nothing serious. I use it for planning and scheduling daily routine.",
Would be 5 stars for sure except I can't add a task to the top of the list. It is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift. And they do know about the idea per the forums. Love everything else.,
Great app for staying organized and creating to-do lists. Must have for those that like to keep track of project tasks or just everyday life tasks.,
"I love it, the widget is great for the basics of writing new tasks and marking completed ones. The best to do list app I've tried. 10/10 would recommend",
"I can't see anything in my projects list at all after the update, and my app has become laggy. Edit: Updated the app and the issue has been fixed. Thanks for the prompt response Todoist team!",
"Great app!! This is what I have been looking for. A more organized and featured setup with a traditional ""outline"" type of foundation. Great work IMO....",
"I tried other todo apps, but this is the best one. It is much easier to use and all my todos synced between my devices. And I can invite my fellows to join my todo list.",
App works great and is a powerful add on to the website. Data always stays synced between two unlike some other apps ive tried.,
Great productivity tool. Simple to set up and use with good options for organising. The Premium option is very good value,
"Perfect app, but sometimes there is a bug when reordering tasks. Tasks ""reorder"", but then, they get back in the same order.",
The best task list. Tried other task apps and this is the most intuitive and reliable. Well worth upgrading to the paid version.,
"yes, another todo list. what is so good? there are templates for projects and tasks, and there is a theoretical base on the concept of productivity.",
"It'll be very useful if we could see the tasks we've completed, rather than it disappearing tbh, other than that, the app is grat. Kudos!",
"Simple, elegant and extremely useful. I especially liked the priorities you can assign (I was looking for an app where I could classify tasks by urgency and importance and this works)",
Really good experience so far. Only improvement I could see would be if there was a very quick way to add a task from the lock screen.,
The widget doesn't work seemlessly. I would have to open todoist once daily and wait for a few seconds to sync the same in my widget,
"The old interface was better (where the menu button was on the top left corner, and would appear with a right swipe) the new interface sucks!!",
"It was a nice app But something really got on my nerve , constantly there was a sound of a notification that really was irritating me , even i turned of notification of this app and every single sound of it , it didn't stopped and i had to uninstall it.",
"Great for productivity if you are easily distracted! As I've downloaded the app and started using it with Chrome's Pomodoro extension, my productivity has risen enormously. I really can't believe it!",
Very user friendly. Easy to add and revise items. LOVE the reminders and notifications. That is critical for me.,
"Great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes. Premium isnt necessary, only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once",
Best feature is that you can clear the notification and if they are overdue take it will come back the next day. will never understand apps that don't keep reminding you of undone tasks.,
"This app is the best I've tried.I have been using premium for 1 mo. and have purchased a year subscription.I'm glad I took the time to work out how to best use todoist for my specific work needs.It's taking some getting used to.My only complaint right now is with recurring tasks.Eg,if you have several tasks you need to accomplish every Monday,as you check them off,the next occurrence shows up on the list immediately.I'd prefer to clear my list and have the same tasks pop up the following Monday",
"After using Todoist for 3 months, I have considered it one of the most effective applications so far. I have planned pretty everything using this app and could not deny to say that it has made my life a lot easier!",
Useless for me because reordering doesn't work reliably. It messes up the tasks after dropping an item to a new location within the project.,
"I love todoist, I use the app and website and it's a life saver. I use it for my todo lists for my own business and even just the free plan offers so much. P.S 4 stars so I don't look like a robot, would rate 5 but god knows how many 5 star reviews are robots angnore.",
"Really Love the app, it helps me set my day and priorities straight... If you want an Evernote alternative, I would recommend this app. Edit: Even Better after adding the new features, you deserve a praise Dev's. I generally never hunt an app down on playstore to give an excellent review, but you made me worth it.",
Great App. I am able do all my daily stuff in one place. you need to pay to open some features like reminder but the free version has all I need for now. overall I'd highly recommend,
My current go-to app for to-do's. Intuative design and easy to use UI makes it simple to track my work and personal tasks.,
"Fantastic application. I love how you set deadlines, priorities and project by simply writing it in the task. Edit: the new board is really a great feature for project management",
"This is the to do app with the best features (or just the features I personally need). However, my recurring tasks keep disappearing, which is simply unacceptable behaviour for a to do app.",
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled.",
"Very functional way to keep important information in a easy to navigate app. Perfect digital tool to apply the concepts of ""Getting Things Done.""",
"Take the time to read about all the features and dive in... awesome tool that I would recommend highly. Way more than just a ""To Do"" list.",
"Only began using it but seems intuitive to use. Love that I have various lists, link to projects, share lists, assign tasks and gave due dates",
"After completing a task it should not disappear, like other apps it should move to the bottom of the list. Please create such a feature! Rest of the app is awesome!!",
"Very good, has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff. Haven't tried the collaboration part yet!",
"Please Add the following features: • Allow to group by ""project sections"" in filters • Allow board view for filters • List view to be decluttered and have columns for the different fields (similar to Asana) • Today and upcoming view to not only show tasks assigned to you, but ALL tasks • Change Add Task widget icon • Ability to change the color of the entire task box, based on priority (currently only the bullet changes color) •Priority: ability to change colors, and to add more priority options",
Wonderful app! Keeps me focused and on task. It was hard to forget anything because it sent alerts and reminders via email. Definetely recommended.,
"Great app that keeps me able to manage my schedule. You'll find that once you start to develop time management skills, there is a lot of time leftover to use.",
"Getting things done. Though, i find that without a due date, some items easily fall through the cracks. Due dates are key.",
Just got a subscription and so far I'm loving it. The only thing I'd like to change so far is for it to be quicker adding a task from the smart watch app.,
"great app to organize both work and personal tasks. either for one time tasks or routines, todoist is the best system to keep track and remind me of my tasks and goals",
"Have tried any.do, wunderlist, Google keep, tasks, Evernote. This works the best for me especially since it allows syncing with calender.",
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.,
"Keeps spamming your email (even after you uninstall the app) with marketing emails. No, I don't want your app, I did not like it, I did not subscribe to you email subscriptions, get lost",
Great app! Too bad a lot of helpful features are for premium only. I'd like to have a calendar layout of the week.,
"Amazingly useful piece if software, enabled me to better organise i do from everyday tasks, food shopping and my personal life goals and projects. I recommend it to friends regularly.",
"I'm awful at keeping on track when i have a big project - whether involving school or a home project, I forget little tasks all the time. ToDoist is great at keeping track of the tasks and you can set up how much nagging you need.",
"Works as I want it to: easy to assign due dates and clear interface. Unfortunately my company has blocked web acces so I switched to MS To Do, which is quite worse without the board option",
Todoist enables me to plan my to-do list with schedules and time which is wonderful for time boxing of tasks... The new boards are wonderful love it greatly as it helps to see the progress of projects,
"Nice app, asy to use, wasn't keen on the email alerts, though I guess they were only doing their job and reminding me what I hadn't done! Easy to turn them off though and enjoying the app even more.",
very good but not as good as Wunderlist. it lacks the simplicity of the interaction. sub tasks for example are not as good implemented.,
"New widget only tells you have something on a particular day, but not what. Tbh, it's become pointless, taking up a large chunk of screen but not providing info at a glance. Now looking for an app that does what it says on the tin.",
Absolutely great to track your to-do-list. I strongly suggest everyone who wants to track their new year resolution to use this.,
"Awesome app! It's like having a spare brain, to remember all the stuff that I won't. Great interface, super intuitive. I like it!",
"It works great. It's simply with extra stuff that I may never use, but Im not in for the details. I needed an easy 'to do list' and Todolost does just that.",
Easy to Navigate with simple task input and completion of task. Sense of accomplishment. I like it so far.,
easy to use and navigate. also lots of options even without paying for the upgrade would definitely reccomend to others,
"Excellent App. Task input, auto recognition of time & dates, Rscheduling is easy. Tried at least 10 other apps but Todoist is best amongst all.",
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article 😡😡😡? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.,
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.,
amazing app! Im much better with keeping on track with my activities with it :) i would really like to request the feature of having a do-date and deadline though so i can plan when to do big tasks better,
"I have a running grocery list, reminders of personal and business tasks I want to do, all at my fingertips. I'm finding new uses for it daily.",
Needs an option to start/end the day at a different time then midnight. Also better options for repeating and expiring tasks.,
Generally it's pretty good. I wish the tasks that don't get done get flagged to come up as either notifications or emails so that you can act on them. Maybe they can automatically go to the next day as well,
A very powerful app and totally reliable. I especially like the Karma system (partly because of anime😜) as it is very sophisticated and clean. All-in-all a pretty reliable method.,
"On free version can't even set a specify time for a task (can only set a date), nor set a reminder. What's the point of a to do list app without these functions? Uninstalled.",
I tried many apps to track my daily to do before settling on to-doist. This is a simple yet powerful app to track your work and progress. I love it and absolutely recommend it.,
"Enjoying writing daily tasks. The app is so easy to use, but haven’t used it to its full potential yet. Syncing across to my laptop, makes life easier too.",
No feedback. And I want to arrange the tasks according to their priorities in the home screen widget. And I want to repeat some tasks weekly.,
It helps me manage my time with such ease. I plan everything in the morning and then complete all the tasks till nighttime. This product is amazing!! Thank you!!,
I was struggling with keep a set schedule on things and remembering to do the things that I need to do. Thanks to this apps widget that I can put on my screen it helped a lot.,
Great tool for kepping me on track. The integrations was very important. I use multiple tools and when they all talk it makes things easy.,
I like that everything I need to do is right in one app with a reminder! Loving it! It also allows lists withing the list you are making.,
"This app literally helped me be a better person by being able to organize my life and get things done more efficiently. The Pro version is definitely worth the buy, too. Thanks, Todoist!",
"I like the app so far. One issue is like someone else said, why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14-day trial? Second, why don't the notifications pop up where I can see them? That was one of the main reasons that I got the app. I need to be constantly reminded of what I need to do. I have ADHD and remembering a bunch of things that I have to do is a HUGE issue.",
"5* scheduling app! Simple and intuitive. Convenient ""inbox"" to list tasks and categorise later. I am enjoying being more proud tive by using this app.",
It's UI is clean and easy to understand. It's feature of auto picking dates by writing the date directly is very good and innovative.,
"It's a todo list, no better than any other, at a great cost, which you can pay for one year up front. I'll use Keep, which does much more, for free.",
"This has been my favorite to do app for years, but suddenly the badge app has stopped working on my Note 10. If I don't quickly find a way to resolve this, I'll be looking for another list solution. 🙁",
"Simple and easy to use. You can schedule events by typing something like ""every other thursday"" after the title and Todoist will automatically schedule it for you.",
"Putting things on the list as soon they pop in my head means I'm remembering to do so much more & having the daily target makes me do the tasks & more. Funny how ticking a box ""done"" can be so motivating. Todoist is fab",
"Perfectly simple, yet very customizable. This app sets out and does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is clear that the developers have had a genuine interest in making other people's lives better and more productive. Highly recommended.",
"Use it everyday, zero complaints and they're actually ahead of the curve as far as providing new features and functionality.",
"Perfect. Simple but effective - I like the calendar integration, calendar view, projects and subtasks.",
"This is a To Do app, yet something as simple as setting a reminder for a task is a PREMIUM feature you have to pay for. How pathetic. There are other BETTER apps available for free. Bye Bye.",
"Sends mails claiming monthly payments of $4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs $7 And also the app is quite crappy without premium, and premium at $4 would still be too expensive for what you get.",
"Don't do it. You have to sign up with your email, then you get emails Multiple times every day pushing you to sign up for the Pay version. Why would I want the ""Pro"" version when the app sucks?",
"Great app! I use it when I realize I am multitasking too much. Also, I created a list for packing and grocery list that I share with the household which is suoer helpful so we dont forget anything.",
Favorite to-do app. Easy to add and manage schedule. Get rewarded for doing so and keeping your productivity streak.,
"Syncs perfectly, very easy to use across all platforms so your tasks are alway at your fingertips be it phone, tablet, computer. Great product, reasonable price!!",
I am now becoming more on top of things with this app. The feature that aggregates your score is a huge boost in morale to make sure you are doing what you intend to do. This is such a great tool and I have recommended this to a few people I know. Thank you Todoist team for this :),
This app is truly awesome. very powerful integrations with all manner of platforms. really nice to have something like this. has reallly helped me to be more organized.,
"flexible tool to capture, organize, filter and manage changing priorities. Goes with me on mobile app and accessible on PC by web browser.",
"(Update:Any timeline to add this?)Hi Can you add secondary filter, like currently you provide filter option priority 1, priority 2 etc. When we r using a filtered view like ""View all"" then all task priority 1 (from different projects) gets lined up sequentially. Here if suppose 15 task have Priority 1, 30 have priority 2 then it is difficult to sort. Can you please add secondary priority filter like SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 etc which we can assign to task and then u know we can see proper sorted view.",
"This app sends an email out to remind you that you have overdue items on your list. if you have many tasks and can't keep track of what to do, you should try this app.",
"wish they had long-term thing, or weekly checklist that wasnt split up by days. besides that, it's great!",
"Best ""to do list"" apo I've ever seen. I tried many, and this one is the most powerful and easy to use. Important thing is that app is improving from day to day. Everything you may be dislike today, tomorrow can be fixed.",
"I wish the app would automatically disappear from the phone's background after assigning tasks. And, a repeat period from-to.",
"Awesome app, helps me keep track of everything I need to do. Best feature is the connection to Google Calendar which makes this just perfect!",
For someone with adult ADHD this app is life saving. Within two weeks my life is back to fully organized. The integration with Gmail and Google Calendar is excellent. I couldn't live without it.,
"So far Todoist (the free version) has been helpful. It has helped me organize, and figure out how to approach, different tasks.",
the one I've stuck with and paid for compared to all the rest. best balance of functionality and simplicity/usability.,
Love the app! Would be even better if you could set daily tasks that occur every day and have a sort of calendar. Thanks,
"I love this app! Helps me keep track of those things that I need to do, priority, and the time they need to be done. A great aid in my productivity along with a good note-taking app. Enjoy!",
Great app that keeps me on track for immediate and longterm goals. Plus it syncs with Google Calendar.,
easy to use! I wanted a to do app and this one fits the bill. not much of a learning curve and can adapt to how i want to use it.,
"love the app, love that it connects seamlessly to the computer version, so pleased that it connects well to other users even in the free version so my partner and i can share project lists.",
Cross platform and easy to use. Would like to be able to list all the tasks across the different projects though.,
I love the functionality and idea. I uninstalled because setting a reminder for a task should NOT be a premium feature.😒 My Google calendar does that as a standard so why have this?,
"Easy to use. I love the email reminders and the ability to add photos, emails, and comments to tasks!",
"I love this app. it let's you separate by category and cross things off as a whole task or even sub tasks. I have lists for every project, for my FT job, passion projects, and small business 100% recommend.",
"Not having push notifications (reminders for tasks) in the free version makes the app entirely worthless, and premium is far too expensive.",
Download it and then immediately uninstalled. Have to pay premium prices to get any features at all. Can't even set up reminders. Don't bother with this app.,
Been using this app for almost 4 years. Truly one of the best. Edit: I just need you to know how badly I've been waiting for Upcoming View! I can finally quit using other calendar apps for good!!!,
"This is a simple app and should not have any premium features and yet, one of the most important things about an online to-do list: a reminder notification, costs money.",
"Has been helpful for events, reminders, chores, and lists. I love that my husband and I can share projects. Easy to use!",
This app is really helpfull. I'm a third year student who have a full room of task. This app so remind me to do my schedule or paper deadline. Thx so much for this app. i love it.,
"Hugely helpful for tracking important tasks. Use in conjunction with something like Google Calendar to help spread work evenly across the coming weeks-- the ""find a day to do this task"" workflow is the only thing I find a bit lacking.",
"Made a list of things to do. Came back and the list was gone, but apparently I'd completed 7/5 tasks and had nothing left to do. Complete waste of time!",
"Nice app for tracking daily tasks. This is the free feature of app. Further, there are premium features in the app at additional cost, which I have not tried.",
"Like others have said. Before it was the best todo list app, but now it's painful to do even simple things. Specifically the additional pop-up window on mobile app is just horrible.",
"Easy and effective task management. I especially like the home screen widget which allows me to view tasks by project, due date, and next 7 days.",
"This is beyond helpful when planning out my day. I use this for both school and personal projects. It's aesthetic, organized, and simple to use. I'm in love with Todoist! 💛",
It's as if this app was designed specifically for me. Really helped me organise and de-clutter my schedule. Thankd for such a wonderful app. keep up the nice work,
"App is great and all. Only one problem though, the shortcut on my homescreen always went missing after i put it. I am using a custom launcer and idk what happened, please fix this, thank you ^^",
It's very versatile; the project system makes it easy to group tasks together. The one problem is that it doesn't have a calendar view.,
Everything is fine.Few things are needed to be added at must to make this app awesome for five stars. 1. Milestone for each Project. 2. Weekly Calenders 3. Dashboard Please add these featuresm I would love to buy a premium if i would get these. Thanks.,
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money,
I have ADHD and this app has been amazing. It has helped me stay focused on my projects and the seamless use between mobile and desktop is amazing.,
It's really helps me to track things that I need to do in my everyday life and it's really helpful to me I didn't know about this until I was going through play store and I saw this and I thought to myself that instead of just writing it down on the paper you have a whole app that you can use to just truck things that are important to you like conferences things that you want to do something that you want to do special for somebody's birthday or something like that.....,
"Instead of tasks simply disappearing from the list when done, please add the option to do a strikethrough. It'll feel way more satisfying.",
I love it. I tried so many to do apps in playstore and this is one of the top 3 for me! Please add calendar view and this will be perfect.,
"This is so beautiful app, im starting I used to use, but I liked apple's reminder app. But after as this app updated and I started using again and explored features, so cool. So useful. This app helped a lot. I totally recommend it and explore features and widgets.",
One week in. Has definitely kept me on task. I recommend easing into it and break down your goals in managble bite sized tasks. Sub task option is a great tool for that.,
"Simple yet powerful, no ads even in basic version, seamlessly connects to multiple accounts & devices, I use it everyday for reminders & task.",
"Very helpful! It's actually helped me to be in track with my work. But the only drawback would be that the other features that you want to use, you'll have to pay for those. But even without that, it's a good app.",
"Easily the best of the best.. already years using these kind of tools yo manage my business, family, tasks all of it!! And this is by far the best of the best and absolutely fabulous.. just remarkable!! Very helpful.. thank you soo much for my making our lives easier.",
VERY HANDY. Using the free version for personal and business task management. Very handy. Everything I need except access to task history.,
Want a better navigation across projects (hamburger menu is too crumsy). But overall I like this app and the service overall.,
Easy to use and reliable. Apps for just about every platform. I appreciate that they publish a real changelog with updates.,
its really helped me to feel less overwhelmed trying to remember everything i have to do. The goals and karma also appeal to my competitive side.,
"Good, it would be great if I could link it to other apps. Perhaps put the lists on a calendar like in outlook",
Good Reminder. has made life easy.. less to remember ..easy to take out in groceries shop..and buy as per the list ..have shared with wife..she adds items to it..while coming from office ...make purchase..from the list..just add some colour to the base ..,
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36€ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan,
Recurring task doesnt show in the following week until you tick off the task from this week. whyyyy? deleted as i can't use this to plan. UI looks great otherwise.,
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.,
Downloaded the app and added a bunch of items and a couple of categories. Opened it back up a few hours later and everything is gone.,
"This is a literal Godsend. It has helped me finally feel in control of my time and actions. It's helping with my mental health, a lot. I'm using it with David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"", and it is helping me make an awesome change in my life.",
"For the widget, please add the option for larger font size. I like to set the compact mode to prevent accidental ticks, but then each Todo becomes very small. Larger font will help with this case.",
"Best app for GTD workflow. But I use it for a lot more than that. It can be used as a list management system for notes, todos, etc.",
Todoist helps me get things accomplished. It helps me plan my work and home life. Its a tool that can be effective in the hands of beginners if you simply read their helpful tips and tricks.,
"Great app for organizing my tasks. my favorite feature was ""inboxing"" tasks that I wanted to do at some point but not schedule it yet.",
"I truly enjoy this app! While I am still getting used to it, I love that it provides a place for me to get my thoughts and to-do items out of my head and onto paper. Highly recommended for folks who struggle with organization.",
Straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop. Sometimes I get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects.,
It's good but not perfect because I have same tasks everyday and the tasks I kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason I am switching to ticktick,
Changed the program so you can't list all tasks unless you upgrade to premium. Looking for a new do list app.,
"I've been using Todoist for several years. It isn't magic. It takes work to keep up with it. However, as a TODO manager, it works very well and has lots of very nice features",
"If you use Gmail, calendar go with Google tasks free with much more functions and integrated with your calendar events, reminder, tasks without subscription. Stick with the big guys! Waste of time with this app.",
I love todoist. It's definitely asking my top 5 apps. I love that there is a Google Chrome extension. It helps keep me in track and beats hand written post-it note reminders!,
I really like how easy it is to schedule and reschedule tasks and it has been very helpful in making sure I have all my work in place for online learning.,
Todoist is amazing! It has really helped me be more organized and productive. Their point system is also fun.,
"this app is extremely easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. as someone who is very forgetful and disorganised, this app really helped me get my life back in order. definitely reccomend",
Best App I've tried (for this purpose) and I stopped trying others until further notice. I'm considering paying for the fancy things since the app is so smooth and it's cheap enough.,
One of the best To-Do (L)ist apps I've ever come across. Superb UI. Customer care was super quick when I faced a problem. Really appreciate the developers for this app!,
"Todoist keeps me on track, and I have a lot going on. The thing I like best is how it works across platforms, and they made sure the Android version works well.",
This app is so amazingly done and so helpful. I can't begin to describe how much value this app has to me. This app make a huge difference in my life by allowing me to build habits and be consistent with them!!,
"I accidently deleted an item then screen rotated and Undo option did not appear! Developers, please preserve state of the app between rotations!",
"I use it as a shared grocery list tool. I was looking for one that didn't require access to my contacts and which you could simply add ""pb"" rather than ""Kroger creamy peanut butter 14 oz.""",
not quite as good as Wunderlist for me... but overall decent and as I need to use this for work now (as wunderlist blocked!) I am trying to get into it broadly. premium features seem quite pricey.,
"Very Good app, if you're interested in a easy and very functional solution to plan out days ( like I do, or just for any type of task list. This is my #1 go to",
"The daily calm has helped me ""finally"" to consistently Meditate and now that I've established the habit I'm exploring the many other choices Calm offers to advance my mindfulness practice. I'm sleeping better and more relaxed. Well done!",
"Uncomfortable manual typing for time setting in a reminder. Time reminders are not stable, some times push notifications doesn't work.",
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} 🤔. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.,
"Love this app its my number recommend todoist app they have some useful template you can itch and the UI is to elegant so you can feel more comfortable on it, I still look for one option is that promo timer hope they came with this in the future",
"Todoist helpse for work, for my life to organize my regular and irregular tasks I use it to remember things and communicate with my team simple to master yet such an efficient tool cross platforms and dedicated to help people Thanks !",
"Definitely the best app out there for syncing honey-do lists, especially if your life is complicated.",
A really well-designed app with an intuitive interface that has helped me declutter my thoughts and prioritize.,
One of my all time favorite apps! You can easily collaborate with your teammates as well as friends. The Karma option keeps you on the track and forces you to complete your task daily.,
Best app for task management. The integration with Google calendar is a great feature. Smart detection of text is awesome!,
"I love using this app. However, the incessant pop up survey asking ""Do you love Todoist"" and ask you to rate it in Play Store makes the app feel like an insecure partner constantly nagging you for validation. 5 star otherwise.",
"switched from Toodledo, never looked back. comments ate awesome because you can attach files. assigning tasks to projects is also much easier",
This app is great for getting all tasks done. I have had it for a few days now but am finding it great. The one thing I think this app could improve on is when you get your tasks or put your tasks in you should be able to put a time that it will pop up on your screen so you can tell if you should have done it in that time. As I said this is a great app and I recommend it to everyone that needs an app to get everything done you need to get done in a day. Thank you for this app it is great. Xx,
"It's a pretty useful app. I just started using the premium version, I will see how it works. But the free version should be enough for many people tough.",
I am using the premium version. I find that the app works well for basic task keeping as well as repeating tasks.,
"Pretty good free features. Simple to use and easy to see and stay organized, especially with the widget on the home screen you can easily see your list of tasks for the day",
"Good and I like it but notifications are only in paid version, but I like that I can link it to my calendar, but I have to take another step to add notifications to the calendar, and I wish when I marked a task as completed it would remove it from my calendar, but it doesn't. Other than that I like it.",
Very useful app. It really helps you schedule your day and the days ahead very very effectively. Once you figure it out how to apply it to your day you will never leave this app!,
"Really amazing! It helps people achieve your tasks... Better than using a ""piece of paper"". Inclusive you can fix commitments in future days.",
New to it. But seems to be very easy to use. I haven't found something I want it to do yet that is hasn't got. I especially like the gmail integration even though its limited on that side.,
Best task app ever. I always enjoy widgets and this is the only app I found that has one. The reminders are great and the UI is easy to use,
"Good design but when you uncheck items on a list it doesn't put them back into their original order, making it pretty much useless.",
I'm probably not using it to it's fullest potential but it works for what I needed. The main thing I needed was for unfinished tasks to automatically roll over to the next day. Most apps don't do that.,
This app is amazing for students and it allows me to keep track of all my assignments and it helps me make sure that the assignments are never late.,
"Best to do App ever! I am a Supervisor at the company I work for and require my staff to use this app. If you can make a way for a group to access one app and one person to manage the task in that group...fire! I believe in you, make it happen!!!!",
very simple and intuitive interface. love hiw you can set dates and projects by just typing it next to the todo.,
"reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great 🙄",
"Great productivity app! Tried Wunderlist, Asana, trello- not for me. Todoist is simple and clean + the 2way gcal integration is something I can't live without anymore. Thought about switching to notion but for now todoist is my dawg",
"Great, clutter free, to the point app with enough features (if you think it doesn't exist, Google it! There's many hidden things you need to know!)",
Very good way to stay organized. The subtasks and subprojects are helpful. Reminders and due dates too.,
Works well. No crashes or sync errors so far. Intuitive to use. Dark mode option is much appreciated.,
"Works great and keeps me on track! Wish a few more options were free, but I can work around them well enough.",
works great for me style of task organizing. it is fairly adaptable so you can make it what you want. i highly highly highly recommend this.,
Awesome app. Been using a few years. Love syncing between all my devices. Really helps me to stay organized and more productive.,
"Reliable, easy to use, and well-maintained. I use google tasks and google keep also, but i find that this app helps me manage my to-dos in such a way that makes it indisposable, even as a user of those other services",
"Update: thanks but still doesn't help - could it be phone? On Huawei mate 10. First review: Coming from wunderlist, main use shared shopping and admin lists with family, so have shopping project with sub project for each shop. I made the Shopping project the home screen, but can't see any sub projects and their tasks on Android! Can on Mac. Investigating Sections. So multiple taps hunting for undated tasks. Too complex for family, frustrating for me. OK otherwise.",
Saved myself way too many times when I forgot events and deadlines were about to be due because of a hectic work and school balance. Highly recommended for anybody especially going into medical school,
"I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further.",
"The paid upgrades have everything I want in a to-do app! Primary of which is lots of customization with due dates, reoccurance, and reminders.",
Somewhat complicated to start off with. If you can get past the steep learning curve initially it is the best out there.,
I've tried a couple different apps for making to-do lists and this is easily the winner. Amazing design and usability,
"I love the app BUT the new update has brought this glitch where you can't add tasks to projects by clicking on "" add task"". It doesn't work, instead you have to click on the three dots then click add task",
"Its the best 'to do list' app I've ever come across by first impressions, simple and easy to use, looking forward to using it this week to get rid of my admin!",
The best todo app. Sync with external calendar is very fast and reliable (with 2 way modifications).,
Pretty easy system for making a checklist. Also the fact you can share lists with folks is especially nice.,
Do you want a glorified piece of paper? Here's the perfect app for you. If you thought this app would give notification reminders to do something you have to buy it. A 30 second code cash grab is all this app is.,
"Very handy. The paid feature handling is annoying, those should be disabled (grey) rather than trigger a dialog soliciting purchase ok/cancel. Five otherwise.",
I keep on forgetting to open it and tick off my tasks. They should like send more notifications but not spamming. Otherwise this is an amazing app!,
this app is so amazing... the UX is so simple and u have alot of options to adjust to your task.. syncing with web app and desktop apps. that's my daily task planning app ♥️,
The app does everything I need it to do. And I've been looking for an app like this for about 2 years. Big fan of the optiin to make tasks recurring!,
"Having used many ways to be productive in my time, todoist has been my go to todo list for over 4 years now, which I use along side google docs for wordy notes. Well worth the annual cost to get lables, notes etc",
"Todoist has a lot of nice features but it does not include a Start Date, only a Due Date, which makes it difficult for me to use.",
"Using the free version, very pleased so far. Voice ability very useful and mostly accurate.",
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick.",
"In the pricing it states the free version has use of up to 80 projects, but the software cut Me off at 5 projects, rendering it useless to Me. Response ti Devloper response, I sent an e-mail to the contact address right after you responded, and still have not gotten a response to My e-mail .... sad",
"The wear os app does not synchronize correctly with the phone, nor do the widgets synchronize correctly. Once this is fixed it is back to 5 stars.",
Its really good. But is there a way to create a task which repeats itself after certain period of time say every monday just like Google calendar,
It wouldn't let me authinticate a sign in. I tried with using Google to sign in & the screen darkens but does nothing. I tried using email & it kept spinning. I tried with Facebook & it said I logged in but then did nothing. Installed because what good is it if it's not going to let me use it?,
So far Todoist has helped me maintain and complete tasks that would otherwise be missed. Easy to use and reliable.,
So efficient and easy to use. i love having my list everywhere no matter what device. I love being able to add items on particular days.,
"Really great app, but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature: notifications for a timed reminder.",
This is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing. You pay not good at all With free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app,
"Hamstringed app that just tried to get you to spend $36 for timed reminders etc. Just use Any.do or any other task app, and you can get all of this apps functionality for much cheaper. SCAM!",
"Wow, this is so slick. Has to be the most polished app I have ever used. Not really surprised as the web, Windows and iOS are all superb as well. This is so worth the $4 a month.",
"I am one of the oldest todoist user and this app has sorted my life like anything, kudos to you guys for creating such a useful app. I would urge to just add one more feature which shows the month view.",
"Excellent todo list app for personal use. smart text interpretation, reminders, sub projects, it has everything.",
"Neat, easy to use and a clean design. Would have been the best if the activity log wasn't a premium feature.",
Spent 5 minutes trying to create a recurring task and failed. Setting up a reminder for a task is a premium feature? Seriously?,
"Pretty much all my ""life"" schedule is organized by todoist. Happy to pay for premium package as well, very much worth it whether you are a professional or a student and so on, so on. Recommend!",
"Thank you for letting me know, I will take a look to try it again, and update my review at that time ------ Looking to set reminders, but alarms are only on premium feature so I can't even confirm if this app can do what I need it to do before purchasing.",
It has been a great tool for keeping track of whats due in all my classes. It also helps me to plan my weekly schedule better.,
Keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project. This app will definitely help you in all the ways it can. Great for increasing productivity.,
After Wunderlist was bought out I had chose this app as the next big todo list app. It offers the most integrations and advanced functionality than any of its competitors.,
Not sure what happened with the redesign. None of my tasks are visible in the projects or inbox. Unusable right now.. Edit issue fixed by dev,
I have been using it for about a week and it has honestly helped me keep me priorities straight for stuff like school work. If you having hard time deciphering which thing to tackel first or just want a to do list I recommend this app,
Reminders require Premium. I only have the free version for now. I'd like to have it on my phone too but apparently it isn't compatible with my phone. Not sure why.,
Great app with no ads disrupting experience. You can share tasks with other people and has lots of customizable options.,
I really like having the 7 Day widget on my homescreen. Helps me to keep important to dos on my radar eg. Was gonna rate it 4 stars at first bc some of the stuff is paid for but then again they gotta make a living somehow...,
"Easy to use, helps me note things quickly, works across my devices. Has a nifty widget too. Still using the free version and loving it so far.",
"And app requiring my email address just to see what it offers gets an automatic one-star review and deleted from my phone. If you want to make money of my PII, I want to see what I'm getting in return first.",
Very good app. Some features are non-intuitive which reduces the rating by a star. Otherwise very good.,
Seems great so far. If you add an option to make the widget clear or transparent I'll give you money for premium. *edit- they literally added this for me in less than a week,
Sayonara Wunderlist. I used it for a year and didn't know what I was missing. Know all those Wunderlist features that you've been Googling that only come up in forums as user suggested features? Todoist has them.,
This app has been worth the equivalent of thousands of dollars to me in saved time and productivity since I started using it four years ago. It's one of my favorite apps I've ever found. I cant recommend it highly enough.,
"Don't bother unless you want to pay. A lot. There are free apps (or Post-it Notes) that do everything this does, much, much more inexpensively.",
The free option has all the features I need. An alarm would be nice but since I don't have the premium I'll do without for now.,
"So far, I'm just trying to move the constant cyclone of ""Did I take my vitamins?"" ""I need to call the dentist"" ""Let's learn Arabic for some reason, did we practice today?!"" out of my head and into an app, and this has worked fairly well for that. Plus Hannah Witton uses it and she rules, so good enough.",
"Very helpful and easy to use to help organise day to day tasks, even the free version has enough featurss to organise yourself efficiently.",
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.,
What kind of app doesn't support 2FA in 2021? Seriously todoist. People have voted for this feature and requested it numerous times. Shameful security practice. I love this app and I have found it useful but please add support for 2fa!,
"I use it for everything- grocery list, agendas, homework, etc! It's the best tool and I love that it can sync to my Google calander!",
Very easy to use and sub task feature is great. Would love a separate grocery list feature incorporated.,
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders,
"Everything is great, But it would be nice to have a habit tracking option or maybe something like daily planner.",
"My go-to app for checking off to-do lists. Simple, smooth and easy to operate. Highly recommend it to everyone 😀😊😀",
"Great to do app I love being able to check off items as I do them. I also like the labels, filters, and projects (premium)",
"I've been using this app for a couple of years now, and I still love it. I use it instead of a calendar and to-do list. The only little thing I wish was different is that I'd like there to be a way to scroll further into the future than just 7 days (next 30 days maybe?).",
This simple app has transformed our business by allowing my boss and I to share a task list. Board view needs to make it to the Windows app though.,
Excelent tool. I use it every day. It has helped me to keep track of pending tasks that would normally get lost if I keep it only in my mind.,
"It's like a to do list, but broken up so it's less manageable. And who doesn't want an email every morning saying 'Here's everything you didn't accomplish yesterday.'",
The best organising app I have ever used. Very intuitive and very well designed. It has been a huge help.,
Excellent app with useful features to get stuff done! Thankfully not bloated with ads or useless features. Highly recommend!,
You have to pay to get simple feature like reminder. What a pathetic way to get paid subscribers. Company only care about money. I don't care about your fancy feature of subtasks or what not but reminder should be free feature.,
"You have to pay for alerts, which defeats the purpose. But it's simple and organized well. Good if you remember to check it.",
Used to be Any.do user for many years but getting buggy thus making the switch over & never look back. This app rocks in every ways.,
"I love this app so far. It has helped me maintain my focus during the day and remember what us important to me, rather than reacting to unscheduled interruptions that steal time.",
it works. but WAY TOO EXPENSE and compkicated than most user will need. this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating.,
"I love being able to empty my brain out in this app for all the stuff I need to get done, so I don't have to try and remember everything. I sleep much better at night with less worry!",
"Wish there was a little bit more flexibility for notes, etc. Overall great for a free app.",
Great app. I look forward to using it everyday. The only issue I have is it should have better integration with Google Home or Alexa.,
Satisfied with its user friendly options except that some basic features like reminders are unavailable in free version.,
"This app, along with Cave Days and the Freedom app, are helping to completely transform my relationship to my work and my ability to organize and implement projects and goals. I highly recommend it!",
This is a very well designed app. I especially love the ability to share lists with my wife and make comments back on forth on specific tasks.,
This app is super easy to use and very helpful for tracking tasks. Haven't used all the features yet but loving it so far!,
Helful and easy to use. Easy to transfer tasks to a new day. Not overly complicated interface.,
"Helps me keep everyhthing I have todo in one place since using it I haven't forget any task. Work, Personal and more work non stop todo lists with no stress.",
Why i couldn't add a widget where i can manage all the tasks I've scheduled for a week? The only widget that is available is the widget where it will help mo to directly open the app. Looks like the old version was more helpful.,
Why editing task is so difficult. Intuitively I long press to edit but no response. Then I have to figure out here and there to find how to edit.,
My favourite app! My life is so much more organised and easy now that i can add in anything and everything that needs yo to be done for the week or day in one place.,
After one week of using Todoist I have realized how many tasks i used to postpone. Both computer and phone app helped me with completing all of them and I will definitely recommend it to everybody from now on.,
Super app. One of features to add to basic version is type of calendar task distribution to visualise your week/month/year.,
App requires registration to start usage. Seriously!? I thought that email doesn't required for offline todo list. Why I need to register if I don't want to use optional online features?,
Still love Todoist. Works well all these years. It works well with no crashes or force closing. Works as it says on the tin Thanks Todoist team. 👍🏾,
"This is more than a to-do app. It's part philosophy, grounded in solid time management and productivity principles. I believe that's what sets this app apart.",
Immediate uninstall and 1 star rating because you have to PAY FOR PREMIUM in order to access the REMINDER function - utter foolishness! The whole purpose of me looking for a To Do List app is so that I can be reminded of my daily tasks.,
Seems almost perfect. I'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks/assignments/etc.,
Really good app. Edit 9/15/21: Still not happy about the 5 projects limit but the technical team was responsive and bugs have been fixed quickly.,
Absolutely amazing app for helping you to organise projects at home and at work and actually get stuff done. Get it you won't regret it.,
This has become my go to task tool. it's multiplatform with a load of features but doesn't overwhelm you. fantastic natural language support for scheduling.,
It's a wonderful app. It's very easy to define the dates to be reminded which is unlike the traditional to-do apps.,
"Very helpful and convenient for forgetful, disorganized, or even well organized people -when I manage to check it that is...",
Extremely usefull application. You can use it on both pc and mobile with automatically updated lists.,
being given productivity through this allows me to really categorise my teeth and activities and projects I'm working on. I also use it as my mind on Friday just dump everything and any idea that comes up during the day and it does a really good job but classifying them,
"Sophisticated and Well designed to-do app, that works as a complete package even on free version. Personally, it's the best to-do app ever made.",
"Clean UI, and great integration with the desktop and web apps. The to-do list I always come back to.",
"So bloody good. I dont pay for apps, but i had to pay for this because of how good it is. The design thinking that has gone into this has thought of everything I've needed to far. Im writing this review because the app deserves it.",
"By default tasks are due today and it's not easy to find the option to change this. I wanted to save time, not spend time learning another tool. Uninstalling.",
"I've been feeling more completed lately. Like the things that I might normally be forgetting to do are now finally getting done. Every day. And I love finishing everything for the day and getting that message that says ""Take the afternoon off, good work!"" 😆",
Simple and easy to use. It should automatically sort by date though. You have to resort each time you enter something,
"Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users.",
Perfect and simple to use. Just what was needed to keep my buisness organised and staff up to date with tasks.,
learning to be more disciplined. this app helps me a lot... Only thing is that if the developers could make the reminder feature free it would be great.,
Meets my need to have an ever evolving list. Like calendar function and how it sends reminders. Keeping me on task.,
"todoist is simple and performs exactly as i need it to, no more no less. simple andstraight forward it is a great management app!!",
"I love this app. Its really quite simple and productive. It made me very organized this past few months and Im really grateful for it. By the way, I shared this to my friends in class.",
This app opens with a slow loading screen followed by making me wait for an animation to finish. I immediately quit and uninstalled.,
Premium version give you anything you could possibly want in a task organizer for business. Free version is great as a personal task organizer.,
"The new update is remarkable. Best todo list app available, though still has some issues with task scheduling that causes sub task duplication.",
Horrible platform. Nothing is easy and it wont let you change a date and no save button. Un-installed within hours,
"I love this app. Gets me to sort my minds daily tasks on the go as fast and as efficient as possible. Superb, gets the job done!",
In my opinion there isn't a better task management system than Todoist and the Andoid app and included widget are excellent. I have integrated Todoist with Ganttify and my calendar and manage all my tasks and projects with that combination.,
Do you what makes this app great and so superior than other? It allows me to sync my tasks to google calendar!!!! Do you know how hassle free my task list and schedule now? It's so bomb I love it!! TRY IT THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE!!!,
I like that you can repeat task in certain time period from completion date. This sets this app apart from most other to do apps.,
"Customizable, clean interface. Calendar integration. Cross platform. Very worthwhile.",
"Automatically completes task, for the day, as I open the program. I do not have any access to see what was completed or if I lost something important I have to do.",
You cant set reminders without paying. What is the point of an electronic to do list if you cant be reminded to do your tasts.,
Love the multilayer to do lists and the ease of organization. Breaking bigger tasks into smaller ones is a breeze!,
"I love this, is free, easy, adjustable, or simple a to keep list, and even if you forget you can always come back to the tasks later",
"I like the interface. Like any organizing app, the magic is in the user rather than the tool.",
Very easy to use and also syncs with my Fossil Sport smartwatch! Best to-do list app that I've used.,
Very simple clear helpful app. I usually can do lists but this makes it possible to make the most and actually refer to it again!,
it's not a user friendly app..too much complicated usage. it's of no use. don't have an option of recurring task.its not mobile friendly app... i prefer not use this app in my life.. waste of money and i dont know why this one cost is 300+ bucks..,
Great app. We'll integrated with my email client. Use on my Mac as well and everything works seamlessly. Using free version.,
"While adding time to a Task asked me to subscribe for premium 😂 I said sorry, uninstalling. I can pay for an app for extra features but if I am expected to pay just for basic functionality then plz make it a paid app at the first place.",
"Google Calendar sync is fixed. I'm able to sync my tasks with my GCal, and the app is once again as useful as it always was.",
"I use this app more than 5 years and it's very productive. Now I have to report some problems & requests: 1. App widget have some problems like freezing in Microsoft luncher's feed. 2. You have many persian users from Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikestan and their immigrants around the world. So it's necessary to implement persian language and Jalali (Hijri Shamsi) calendar. For this requests you can use our persian users helps for translating and technical stuffs.",
"For the love of god explain me why there's no option to always show the tasks I've done??? I don't want to go to the main tab to the submenu, like WHY can't I reach today's ""done"" tasks from today tab??? And no option to make them not hidden as soon as a tap it done.",
Spiciest task management app around. Constantly pleasantly surprised when I discover new (and super useful!) features.,
I like how simple to use the app is. All basic functions that I need are covered in the basic version for free.,
"excellent for hobbies, work and projects. I really love it and it's really flexible. I use it all day as a premium user with no regrets! Love it",
"Fantastic, functional & user friendly. Todoist is responsible for a marked improvement in my productivity, and i will likely continue my membership for many years into the future.",
App worked great up until recent update that added check boxes..Now I keep accidentally marking tasks complete. Please add a setting to disable check boxes,
Really useful. I use it to organise my week and don't get stressed if I have to move tasks around to later days in the week.,
"Good app. I used it quite a bit, until the version changed and became incompatible with my phone.",
It has a lot of features. But I need simple one not that much complicated. I need one app which will manage my today task. It's good but not simple to use.,
"Definitely helps to keep on top of all my tasks. Easy to use interface, love being able to create projects.",
"Great interface, plenty of features. The app is easy to use and very helpful in managing my time.",
It's the perfect kind of list I've tried. Everything is great. It could be better if we had a calendar view as well.,
"I love it! Easy to navigate, prioritize, review, and helps I have yet to discover.",
I've started using Todoist again recently and fell in love with this app. It's one of the best list managers and the big advantage for me is that it is cross platform,
Easy to use and really customizable. I'm really enjoying it and it helps me keep everything organized. Definitely recommend.,
Seems like a great app if you didn't have to pay $36/year just to be reminded of a task. I deleted this app and will be downloading another one that won't try to take my money.,
Basic functions work all well. Good UI and sectionings of works. Will get you through the basic needs.,
"Like it so far, will see how it holds up Update after 1 year: stable, clean, intuitive interface, bump review to 5 stars",
"Excellent user experience. It has become a daily necessity for plannijg my days, weeks ,months and life.",
"It is simply amazing, by far the best to do list and productivity tool I have ever use. I definitely recommend it. For what it's worth, I never rate apps but this one really deserved it.",
"good app, but UI is confusing and smart date recognitions is buggy/doenst work: when i for example set the date to 3.5.2022 it will choose the 5th of march even tho i set the date format to DD/MM/YY using the 3/5 format unfortunately doenst fix the issue",
"Great app that helps me keep track of tasks. I love that I can connect with my husband and we can crest a project board with tasks that we both need to do, and who will do each one.",
Lacking calendar/monthly overview to be able to perceive tasks & projects also in a timely manner! So that essential dimension is just missing.,
"This app is interesting and easy to use, the best feature is that i can put the time in the description of the schedule, thats impressive",
has really helped me with large projects and to follow the bullet journal method of giving each task a date/time instead of keeping one long list.,
"After much research and using many different apps, I've settled on todoist as the most comprehensive and practical for my needs. I use a combination of GTD and other tools, and todoist copes well with them all",
A fantastic app for trying to manage your life and time.. yet still fail. But the app actually makes me remember that I have something to do. But still.. I won't do it.. for.. reasons.,
"It helps me to stay focus throughout the day. With priority option, i can decide which task i need to be done first. This apps is useful! Awesome!",
"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task.",
"So my keyboard recommended you, but you have no way for me to get help... I just had one simple question but the only help available is articles you choose to show...and only business customers get to interactive with you so since I couldn't contact you & i HATE secretive businesses so I'm here to tell you I am now not interested in your product (I was initially)... Good luck with the business customers since that's what you care about more. The end...",
"looks great, but reminders/notifications are a premium feature. Google calendar is better.",
"It's really a great to do list app, must try. But this app is lagging after latest update or maybe because I integrated Google Calendar and then removed it. Please help",
Solid free app. Being locked out of extra functionality with a paywall is a little irksome but nothing I can't got over. It does what I need it to.,
Very useful and hopefully more features for the free version. Have to pay for a lot of basic usages.,
This app has helped reduce my anxiety tremendously!! Being able to write down my daily tasks (no matter how menial) has been a game changer!,
"The App works wonderfully, i love it. But, it could work best with an alarm to notify you of the task/s at hand.",
Best 'to do list' app hands down. Been using for 3 years. Android + mac integration is spot on. I genuinely love it. So so so useful,
absolute productivity enhancer. Thank you for this amazing app. Looking forward to stick with it till i stick with technology.,
"I have been enjoying this app for a good while, over a year now. The recent update moved this app from ok, useful with some mild frustration, to amazing. Super pleased with this fix.",
So far so good. Very convenient especially the split into parts features. I'm a happy user.,
"Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete",
"You can't do anything with the free version. You get 5 lists or projects. So maybe if I lump everything under Business and Personal I can do something, but I can't really organize.",
"Fantastic App! Very user friendly, but loving the reminders and multiple options for organization.",
This is so rad. It's so easy. This works with my brain. I made all the lists and categories on my laptop and now I just add to them as needed on the app.,
Very easy experience making and completing tasks. Main reason I chose this app is because I can choose to make the take on my phone or in the desktop,
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap.",
It's nice but is it required that we really need to pay just for a timer? I mean other apps have premium too but they didn't lock the timer for tasks. Kinda frustrating to use the app.,
Love it but would like the widget to have a way to enter the full app like it used to. There's some things that are not accessible in the widget,
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing",
Enjoying it so far. I just cant seem to sync it with my calendar so I get no notifications for my to-do list and I need to open the app to check I need to do.,
I don't know what is going on The app works fine on my pc But on my phone it's keeping loading the content with blank page It may be a sync bug Hope you fix it,
"Flexible, Fast and Multi-Platform! Loving all of the capabilities Todoist offers - especially the Outlook and Gmail plug ins.",
"Hi, todoist team Android app is suddenly including brackets 【】 whenever I am trying to assign a project and a flag or PRORITY to a task.. request you to please fix the same example - Error sample [Out] [Personal]",
"Just a really good tasks app. Great syncing across the web, and a tidy interface.",
"As part of an overall strategy of organizing my life and using other apps to track my moods, meditate, and limit my time on social media, this app is an incredibly positive addition to my life.",
I downloaded the app yesterday. It was working well until today but now whenever I clicked on it shuts down and keep telling the app has a bug so I should contact the developers.,
"almost all that i need for a powerfull todo list, as a freelancer i want to use for work also, but we need more functional between tasks. meybe some agile, scrum, ... platforms integrations 😜",
I use this app everyday! It helps me keep up with what I have to do and shows me how often I put things off. Very organized and useful.,
"Been using this for a while now, it's good and I prefer it over other to-do list type apps. The app does everything it's advertised to and performs very well. 👍",
Tried several times to sign up and each time it said my password/s were too easy to guess and to choose a stronger password. I gave up and uninstalled.,
"New changes to free plan make app useless without subscription, putting crazy limits on features free users depend on. Total bait and switch.",
"Excellent app. I use it constantly. I love how this syncs between my phone, work computer, and home computer.",
"Best todo app ever. I use it every day, and I couldn't live without it. The best feature is the auto-tagging of input text.",
Definitely my go to auto fill password app. Makes switching from ios to android so much easier as I use them both for work and personal.,
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.,
"very inconvenient, too large interface for task bullet (very few tasks show on the screen). overall VERY limited functionality",
"It can be a little ruff to learn, but is so useful for ppl like me that have trouble with memory. The widget makes it alot easier for me.",
Really a very good task list manager and much more. I use it to plan my day and store materials for future use. It's an excellent app and I expect to use it long into the future.,
I love this app. Perfect for organizing all my homework assignments! Clean layout and easy to use.,
Old ui have facilities to click on the task and you can close or rename or edit the task but new one have some limitations so please roolback to old ui that is very good for all we are 40 users and all have problem,
It works great! Easy to input tasks and sort them. I am only using the non-premium version but I love it already!,
"Showing an already tick for recurring task will be helpful. Other than that, It was very convenient.",
Very useful especially if you're a forgetful person that has a lot of things to do. Customer Service is responsive too! Recommended!,
good app. but there is a fault. items are not arrange (sort) automatically by date in both app and widget. please fix this.,
It's very easy to get started using the app in a simple way and then grow to use some of the more advanced features. I like the UI. So far so good!,
I didn't care for some features because I had trouble using it but I had mixed feeling about a team to help keep me on task.. but I need that sometimes I like some free apps more .,
easy way to list daily tasks and create recurring ones. I like thst the lists are synchronized between phone & laptop.,
"It's just awesome. I tried a few different tasks managers before but I wasn't really happy with any of them. This one is so well made, though, I would recommend it to everyone, who wants to organize his life.",
"by far the best Todo app I've ever used,and I've used plenty...the design,the minimalistic look and feel,the many features under the hood....its awesome...highly recommended",
"Cracking app, surprised it's free. It's just like my old filofax. List what you need to do in order of importance and urgency, works really well, especially for an old duffer like me",
"Have been suffering with ADD for a long time, Todoist is one of the only apps that has helped me to function and stay on task. A life saver in the most literal way.",
"I really like it, it's great. The location based notifications are perfect for my ADHD mind.",
"Layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm, reminder etc are available only in premium version.",
"You will be asked to upgrade to a premium just for the sake of adding reminders. Well that is not satisfying, reminders should be available just in the beginning.",
"This is just for latest update. The UI gets blank, the tasks don't show and it keeps hanging .... Please fix the bugs",
To remove my account I have to install the app? What poltroon designed this? You'd have to be addled to think this is a good idea. I get email spam and to stop it I have to reinstall the app? Beware getting this.,
"Basically perfect. I just wish there were a native UI for Linux, but the web app is solid enough that I'm satisfied.",
"I have used todoist for several years now and it is simply spot on. Easy to use, easy to customise as you wish and so useful. I can heartily recommend.",
"Almost perfect, the only thing is missing is a persistent notification that works like the widget, just to add quick things",
Easy to use tool for becoming more efficient with my limited time and multiple projects. Great reminder!,
"Hey folks, it's an app I've heard lot of great things about, but it's not opening for me! I'm on Redmi note 8 pro. Can you please look into it? Thanks! I'll change the review as soon as it works. Best of luck!",
Been using todoist for around 3 years now...it helps me keep track of everything! Also love how easy it is to reschedule the to-dos that don't get done.,
"After connecting my Google account, the app is stuck loading the front page. I can't do anything on the app. Restarting the app and my phone didn't help.",
"It took less than an hour for the developer to start spamming my email, so this app was uninstalled within 1 hour. No idea how good it is. The day after uninstall, i keep receiving spam...",
"As a GTD and productivity enthusiast, I think Todoist is the best task manangement app on the market. Simple, yet it has all the advanced functionality you need to effectively manage your work.",
"super handy... quick set up and entry of tasks, clean interface, good function set for free version.",
"Todoist is enjoyable for me to enter, organize, prioritize and plan what I want to do, to remember and keep lists like wish lists.",
"I'm still learning and I like the app, but I wish there were task durations and I wish I could easily review tasks that I have accomplished.",
"This is definitely the all round to do list app that I need. Nice UI, text recognition, and tasks management",
"I love this app, this fit my needs. I would give 5 star if you also put a calendar widget, then this app would be perfect. I highly recommend it.",
"Greatest App I have ever used. Well thought out, organized, the only App I can honestly say that I use every single day. Never forget a thing! Helps me sleep better at night.",
Really well thought out app. I like how flexible it is and the way subtasks are visible within the project.,
"My go-to task list app. I basically run my whole life through Todoist, it has great UI and it syncs super well.",
"Great app and it really helps me stay on top of things, though I do wish I could be able to put events in too for example :friends birthday from maybe 10 am to 2 pm and things like that",
"It was working fine until last update. Now it can't recognise what date I'm typing. Instead today ""at 10"" it skips to some other day. It is very annoying to use app like this",
Really been useful in keeping me productive and on track. I've started over after a recent kidney transplant and this app has helped me keep the structure I need in my life.,
This used to be my go to app. Now you have to pay for even the smallest features like setting a time on your reminder. Uninstalling and finding another.,
Makes me feel very productive. nice app. i like the fact that there is a chrome extension for this app so i can sync my to do list on my laptop and phone.,
App is great as a Wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money? It is not possible. Unfortunately i won't use this app.,
Perfectly easy to use and follow. I appreciate the reminders every day too. I accidentally ended up relying on this app instead of my calendar app. It's just so much better!,
GAME CHANGER!! It's multi functional so you can view what you need without being overwhelmed yet super easy to use.,
"Great app, I love how well thought UX it has. Thanks to the free month to try it I could really try if the app is good for me and now I am happy premium customer because it is by far the best app for todos. I am using it for my a bit enhanced GTD and my productivity has actually skyrocketed ever since I use Todoist 😊",
"Please add the task anounser in this app. Because, if we are away from yhe mobile then we can easily leason it . But now it only remember us in the form of notification but i want it as like alarm means more sound please please solve my problem please",
"Good App, the only things I would add is a visual user face and remove the glitch of prevously typed task being posted with the new ones.",
"todoist is easy to use, has all the features I want, and really organizes my life. game changer, highly recommend!",
Was great before the new 'redesign'. Now it's a PITA to reschedule things. I wish they'd stop messing with things. May have to check out a different app,
"I like the concept but it is very complicated, specially entering recurring tasks or editing.",
Anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless. Uninstalled.,
Successfully used this app to manage my professional and personal life over several years since first installation. I cannot speak highly enough of its reliability and ease of use.,
"Best to-do/productivity app. Amazing and feature-rich, clean and organized look. 10/10.",
I love using this app. I moved from Wunderlist (canned by Microsoft) to To Do and the featuers of Todoist are the most intuitive and helpful.,
Great program to keep myself organized. I just found out that I can send projects to my employee and they update on his app as I update mine which is very useful for work.,
Absolutely great app. Use it to monitor my packed engineering college schedule. It works across my phone and computer! Can't recommend enough,
By far the best app I have ever managed to find for productivity 🙌 Brilliant in every way. I'm addicted and feel like I am achieving much more without feeling overwhelmed.,
"I suggested this in the past, but the ability to set a persistent reminder, like an alarm, would be a great addition to the app.",
I couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks.,
"when you use it like it's designed, it helps incredibly to get your task laid out, your life organized, and things accomplished.",
"Since last major update, rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled, preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day. Productivity killer.",
"Good application, it keep me focused on my goals. One downside is whenever I put a new task on a specific day it doesn't areange it automatically, i have to do this manually",
"Latest update causes app to crash and stop syncing. Quick response and an update later, seems fixed. Thanks team",
"Solved: my two filters' queries was replaced the string ""query"". -> logged out and re-logged in the app and the queries were recovered. Thanks so much ✨",
"quite a few tasks are unavailable unless you pay. I like the reminders, but think I will stay with my Outlook calendar",
Why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app.. what dev.. you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that. Ridiculous.. uninstalled.. just needed a to do list app as simple as that.,
Clean interface that doesnt get in the way. Also enjoy how it parses your tasks for things such as due dates.,
Absolutely love the app but the new checkboxes take up too much space. Please add an option to hide them.,
"Very easy to use. Love that I can just type ""tomorrow"" or ""Friday"" and it knows to just add it to that particular day. Very intuitive to use.",
I just love this app! I link this to my laptop one too! My organization in tasks and to-do lists have never been more satisfied with an app!,
"Brilliant, some quirks but once you learn them then its great. Love its ability for sharing into todoist as comments and tasks, from other apps.",
"Great app. I'm a 'list person' and am loving this app as i no longer have loads of paper lists, and have my list handy wherever /whenever i want it now :)",
"very useful, especially since it synchronises with your account and can be updated from all your devices!",
"great design, intuitive, and a very robust free version that is not intrusive with ads on every action",
I started using this for 1 week and I already fall in love with the product. The app is simple and intuitive yet powerful enough to make your days much more productive.,
Simple. Brilliant. Love some of the extra features like sending via email and all that.,
The ability to easily reschedule tasks I can't complete today is SUPER helpful - and makes it easier to end my day with a clean slate!,
"Great app, easy to use, no bumps or lumps so far, no annoying 24/7 interruptions like a lot of apps produce !!!",
It's easy to set up but one downside is that to set a reminder on a task I have to upgrade to premium and its not something I wanted to begin with,
I use to love this app until their current terms of service. It gives them a license to use my data any way they want without limitation. NO THANKS!,
Even though you pay for a subscription. It doesn't save your previous lists of you stop paying for a month. Sucks.,
"have been using it for years. very quick and easy to add a to do with the project hashtag and date tags (eg ""tomorrow"" auto adds it to my list for tomorrow).",
"Really good app and nice design, nice features! Unfortunately no reminders option for the free use, no one time purchase option",
Been using for more than a year now.. the way to set up recurring tasks is a game changer. It really helps me to be more productive.,
"so far, this app has been my way of organizing my tasks and myself. i'm glad that it's also integrated with Google Home so i can check my tasks as i dress up every morning for work. good job!",
Really helps me keep my projects in order. I always have 10-15 construction jobs going at one time. Being able to walk in a house and making my list by project with reminders and emails is awesome,
i used to have severe prejudice towards planner apps but this one certainly made it beyond. The free version does what pro versions from other app offer. Looking forward to upgrading later.,
"I just would like to have also the possibility to set and see the amount of time estimated per each task or group of tasks, otherwise I am just in love for the app.",
very intuitive and easy to figure out. good team collaboration too. helpful notifications.,
"Great helper in my everyday life. I use it literally every day and all the time! Thanks a lot for your work, I really appreciate it. And I like articles from the Doist team! You're great!",
To-do lists are the most powerful tool if you want to be much productive. Todoist is one of the bests in this era. Highly recommended!,
"I really enjoy this app, it is great when u haven't completed the thing you were supposed to do so it sends u a little reminder. I would highly recommend.",
"Its a really good app, but I wished that I am able to see the full agenda through the widget and not just for the next week. Maybe there's an option for that but couldn't find it.",
"Fantastic app, excellent service!  Moved to this from Toodledo, and couldn't be happier.  The Todoist team actually built a high quality Android app.  Thanks!",
"Really great app that has helped keep me on track as I juggle work, studying and home life. Premium is well worth the price if you use it daily.",
Great app and constantly improving. Appreciate the hard work by developers which made a difference 👍 However agree with other users that the ability to open the app from the widget was helpful and was taken away,
Been using the free version for a week now. Really helping me keep track of my work and personal tasks. Love being able to use it on my desktop and phone,
"Enjoying the app, but can't figure out how to get it on my Galaxy Active 2 watch. Whenever I try to find the app for it, I get directed to the phone app.",
This app helps a lot with organising my life. its not complicated to enter things and it's easy to form habits because it runs simply.,
"Hi there , can you add a option to select all task and delete in the show complete task section ? Is quite annoying you have to select each of the task and delete . Thank you",
Fantastic design and functionality. Pls update to new Google material design and add a calendar widget. That'd be awesome.,
"Works really well. A great to do list app, while offering so much more, even on the free plan. 10/10.",
"Very well designed. Natural language is very useful. Works well on Android, Windows and Web",
"Please I need help. When I try to log in with Google in the app, it said ""Unknown error occurred. Please check again in a few seconds"". I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but no such luck😢",
"Exceptional experience !! Thanks to all the team. I don't see any mistake for the moment,but surely, you can increase the app. Courage !!",
"Todist is intuitive, easy to use and effective. It gives you all the functionality needed to manage all of your activities no matter the size or complexity.",
"It's easy to add all my task and schedule them. Even I can create projects and many other things. After starting using this app, things are in my control",
It is easy to use and fits my needs pretty much. Cost and time on the task level would be a 5 star review,
"so far, better than any other app doing the same. very easy to use, but the free version, which we use now, lack of many features we found in others.",
"Seems to be a good one, but some critical options and features will only be available when you upgrade your app which demands some money per month.",
"The best to-do app out there, for certain. Downside: not compatible with Android System-wide dark mode.",
"Better than MS To Do. Almost as good as Wunderlist. Only thing missing is the gratifying ""ding"" sound when checking things off.",
Simple and easy to use. Available for windows too so i can sync with my laptop. Good eficiency.,
"not bad for organizing, would be nice if you could set tasks to repeat as necessary, or allow you the option to categorize tasks",
"I used many todo apps ,but this app has fullfield my need for having a board for tasks that i don't know even when i gonna start ,to my daily habits that no longer to be recreated and can be scheduled percically and also normal todo task",
The most expansive task management system I have ever had the pleasure of working with. If you are following the Getting Things Done methodology by David Allen there is no better one than this!,
"Great app, only using the free version. Its a bit expensive for me to get to full version, but i love how easy it is to use and the practicality is great!",
I truly love this app. It helps me my daily act together and look ahead at my week. It's simple to use and I love the ability to break down big projects.,
Simple. Organized and yet flexible. Wish the alarm feature for to do items was on the free,
I would like to be able to move multiple tasks as subtasks instead of one at a time. That is the only criticism I have the rest is awesome!,
"- installed this app to compare with Google tasks, which is free - realized I can't create reminders with the free version, which I can with Google tasks - uninstalled after a few minutes - receiving email spam for 4 days now Come on, guys.",
"Reminders are premium feature ? really ? i understand you need premium subscription to make the company survive , but making the main functionallity of a ""to do "" app premium is a bit much. no thanks .",
Why didn't I find this app earlier? Great app!! Since I started using this app I have been working faster towards accomplishing my goals. Very easy to navigate and is a definite game changer. Shared it with everyone and now you 😃,
This app was really helpful for me and made my daily life easier. Unfortunately the last update with the new HUD has completely destroyed my workflow.,
"Updated to pro but reminders are VERY clunky. Why should I physically write when I want a reminder, why can't I just use the same UI as when I schedule it (that is, by using the clock)?",
"Doesn't let you say you did something yesterday, which is for me a big deal, as I browsed the options looking for a way to do that almost everything was only a premium option",
"I keep coming back to todoist... why is that? ive tried 30+ task managers, but keep coming back. You definitely need to review your tasks weekly but its just a reliable tool.",
Easy to use. Integration with other devices and applications are seamless. Well done with a slick app.,
I've never been able to stick to using a To Do list until now. Great interface and features.,
Used it for a month and am loving it so far. It would be great if you add a feature which lets you add an estimated time for a given task,
"Absolutely loving it, been using Todoist for years now and it only gets better with time. Simple, logical, and available both as an app and via web.",
"This app is so cool. Before using this app I used Google task and that was not that perfect but it was okay for me for a long time. But when I got Todoist app, it changed my whole experience. I highly recommend this app. This app is so fun to use. I love it.",
Very good app....good interface Easy entries and keywords Seeing Whole year review was truly good and that's why I came here to rate them. Thank you.,
Horrible update. It removed Sub-projects in widgets which is used to be very very very useful for a Neurosurgeon like me. Please update again so that I can use my widgets of sub projects.... please please please,
"Really great. It is clear & effective. I can create my own projects and follow them, It shows me tasks from yesterday that I forgot to do and so forth.",
love it! love how it lets me edit on Android widget. also love the amount of subcategories there are! lots of options and pretty easy to figure out.,
"Intuitive UI, but no way to customize fields. Also no reminders for free accounts.",
"Todoist sent me a welcome email, although I never signed up. Now I'm getting email reminders for a task related to crypto currency. Hackers are using this platform for social engineering and fraud. Todoist, please do more to verify new accounts.",
Easy to use app. Well designed interface. Email and phone notifications are very useful,
Great application! Since I started to use it just cannot stop. Really improves your time management skills.,
the app is working well for me so far. somethings i wish it had. 1. A description space for each project (to write the goal statement) 2. End date for each project 3. an option to feature a task in more than one project,
I really enjoy the app. It's very efficient and helps me stay motivated about getting stuff done throughout the day.,
"Love the options for managing individual tasks, and that I can also interact with the list via web browser.",
Very easy to setup a project and creating subtasks required; and checking out completed tasks - achieved when subtasks menu is empty. 😺🥺❤️,
Easy to use and works well across devices. having reminders set by location is pretty nifty.,
"Didn't stick with todoist in the past, merely because there was only one subtask level. Now there are 4. Todoist is the best. Hands down.",
Was a waste of money and time. More time making/managing to-do lists than doing the projects. Not worth the money.,
This is a great tool to keep me on track with my tasks. The recurring options are very flexible!,
"Could somebody explain how do i make this app send me a notification at a scheduled time of my reminder? Right now it works like a list of reminders, that don't remind me to do anything at a time.",
Todoist feels like magic on UI part. NO other app in entire universe look beautiful. Rest is all good. Although I am not using it because notification is not free and Its far precious than i can afford,
The most simple and best user friendly app but as a productivity tool it lacks some features like a weekly view and setting days (not just date),
"Would be a great app if notifications worked. I only get the daily notification, no others for specific tasks set to be done at specific times.",
"Working like PA, always behind me to complete the task. IAM new this but good experience, I would like know about full function of the app then I can give more and better Reviews.",
"Its a really great app! I love all the different things you can filter by - project, tab, priority, date. Awesome 👌",
This app has changed my life. I used to be a procrastinator but with the help of this app I have taken control over my behavior. I would highly recommend if you struggle with getting things done.,
The best Todo organiser I've used. available on all devices I've used and syncs perfectly. Can't really ask for more,
This is a great app used it for quite a while but lately now when I try to add projects in the app not on the web it doesn't add my projects just takes the phrase and puts brackets around it,
"Worth getting Premium, I miss having Things from iOS but now that I have an Android I use this! I tried all the other to-do apps and found this one to be the best available!",
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app,
"Very nice! Wish it was completly free, but obviously the creators gotta make money. No ads, very smooth, must use app for productivity!",
"Amazing, easy to use system that works well offline and synchs seamlessly with the chrome extension.",
It is a great app. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications,
"It's a SUPER COOL app! BUT it would be EVEN COOLER if we could customise the rank names we get after a particular number of Karma? ALSO, just a suggestion, but can we have the ability to customise what we want to call Karma? Like for example, we want to call Karma as Mana or EXP but it still has the same function as Karma. I think that would be AMAZING if it were to be implemented. (◕ᴗ◕✿)",
it works great for simple tasks that I always seem to forget to do like pick up dry cleaning or call insurance agent.,
"This tool, once setup to your style, does an excellent job of keeping you organized and on task.",
I am extremely happy with the app. This app is user-friendly and Absolute best reminder app in the market. I would encourage others to use this app as daily reminder app. Thank you todoist team Fantastic job & Keep it up!,
Requires login/account I don't see any reason to require a login for to do list management. Not clear whether it will work when the device is offline.,
"excellent app i use it with work projects and college studies, great tool for both would recommend to anyone wanting to be more organized",
It's a gr8 app. Very useful for daily planners. But i would suggest it to have even weekly as well as a monthly planner.,
"Login required. A to do list should not require an internet connection, let alone login. I would rather pay with cash than with data.",
No week numbers!! The app very well built but there is no option to enable week numbers. Please add week numbers features in coming updates.,
"This app is a game changer. Google Calendar is awesome, but this app takes productivity to another level.",
10/10 recommend. I've tried a good amount of reminder apps but I love the simplicity and ease of this app. It also has a lot of cool features.,
"Perfect task tracking app I absolutely love automatically set repeated tasks. For example, you write ""pay rent every 25th"" and the task sets repeat every 25th day of month",
"Touch & go, plus Google Assistant stated: it's not support with devise (integration). I'm using a Android phone and have the app on it.",
"Absolutely fantastic app! I've read many complaints about the lack of flexibility of the app, but I think that there's plenty of wiggle room for personalization. I rate it 5 stars. Why does it show one star then? Because the app prompted me to give a review :)",
Totally love this app! I had no idea they had something like this. You have no idea how much of a relief it is to have something that I can keep organized and get those 'things to remember' out of my head! I don't have to worry about forgetting anything!,
did it help with getting my tasks done ? id say yes to an extent. even if I procrastinated a bit it is very satisfying to check the boxes when done. i didnt delete the app right away. still have it,
"I've been using it for years, it was great, all of a sudden I can't create more than five projects because it's a pro feature. Disappointing.",
"it all what we need. Its simple, intuitive and look minimalist.",
"Just let me buy the pro app, why does every thing have to be subscription based? I simply want reminder functionality and it'll cost me 4 bucks a month in perpetuity for that VERY basic function.",
i feel like im more productive durring the day and i can get more done. i like with the premium you get more features like the colors. i change my colors out every month.,
Nice clean app (I use it for personal non-work-related projects). I use it to remind me to do things instead of just watching Netflix.,
lets me make tasks with reminders. which is all i need. they charge for that though. theres probably an app out there that would let me do that for free. but im using this one that is not free.,
"The google calendar integration is awesome, this feature alone makes it better than most other todo apps. Really enjoying it",
perfect solution. I was in trouble about finding best solution for my daily to do listing. After i use this app I niticed that I alteady found the perfect solution. Thanks!,
"Really useful as a college student, but would prefer an easier way to avail the student discount.",
It's great for organising but the app is bugging out. A lot of tapping etc makes events disappear!,
"I BOUGHT this app, then they switched to a subscription model. There should be something that grandfathers their existing customer base in, I'm not happy with this financial arrangement",
Loving this app! But there's a problem I'm facing that the widget doesn't get updated until I reboot the phone. Please fix this.,
i love the fact it won't come in your way but helps you track any task that cross your mind in middle of work so you can review and organize them later. Todoist made me a more productive Person. Thanks 🙏❤️,
just great I recommend paying the subscription for the added benefits because this is the to do list that will never let you down. I use it on my pc/tablet/phone and its so seamless,
A light feel with heavyweight features ready to go! I've combined this with IFTTT and my mail to make flagged emails and email's keywords to pull tasks to Todoist. Love the web interface too!,
This is a very clever and intuitive app. for some reason the widget is slow to respond to taps.,
"I use this everyday to check off tasks and to remember tasks. I have used it for personal projects, family remodeling projects, and family shopping lists.",
This app has been a wonderful addition to my quest to being more productive. it's one of the few apps which I'm considering getting a paid subscription.,
I think this is exactly what I've been looking for since. This app is so perfect to track my daily method of operation DMO. I loved it. Keep it on and up. Thank you all for creating this app,
"It's really convenient and beauty app, but I need more functions and they are paid. Can I watch a lot of ads to have paid functions, please?",
This app keeps me working with no rest for the many things I scheduled for myself. I've should not have downloaded this app because it doesn't miss a thing.,
"Amazing, life changing. Just wish that the phone version showed all the project colours, please fix!",
It's a wonderful support to keep your schedules intact even when one is too busy to keep track of events..,
"How have I not given Todoist 5 stars yet? Love the web experience, and the app ia just one extension of that. I use the ""add task"" widget almost every day with google voice to text to take notes.",
Repeating previous posts- don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium. It's just a shell not worth the space it requires.,
I've tried a ton of todo list apps. This is the easiest and best one that syncs with web,
"amazing time management improvements- has changed the way I do things to make me not miss things, be more efficient and feel more confident because I know I'm organized.",
"Very easy to use from my laptop, tablet, or phone. I can't believe I stuck with paper lists for so long.",
"It was working perfectly, when it suddenly started glichibg and kicking me off the app every 3 seconds. I then deleted, and I'm using a different app now.",
"Works perfectly. Incredibly fair subscription system that's worth the money, but not necessary for a good user experience.",
"This sucks, entered a bunch of tasks and the app set them all to completed and removed them - now after start over! Using something else for sure.",
Simple and effective. Had a great experience using this app to help improve my productivity. Reminders were very helpful.,
I request you if it is possible then please add a list which shows all our comepleted/uncompleted tasks on the top with date and day so it would be a lot of favour on me I'm tired of finding my comepleted tasks in the huge list.,
"Really good for managing all my tasks for the day. I particularly love the widget, that always reminds me of my tasks.",
"Stupid app, only usefull for setting a to do list, which you could do with google docs or other things that you would usually already have, the reminders require payment, I would recommend using another app.",
"This app is simple and useful. I really didn't think I would use it, but after a week of entering all my tasks in the app I'm impressed. Again, simple and to the point.",
"I Iove this app. But I am so urgent to know can I make finished task as"" checked"" this allows me have overall look. But know I have to use ""undo"" to see fade color finished task. Please please reply thank you,",
"Very useful, quick to understand and start using, quite effective for managing general tasks or recurring reminders.",
"Incredible app! My life depends on it! So smooth, so user-friendly and so easy to use. Made my life much more productive! Thanks a ton to the development team!",
"Todoist is as simple as you want it to be or as complex as you need - it works great for organizing my tasks, whether they are work related or just personal things like chores",
Tried Trello too involved and expensive for small operation. Todoist Works beautifully and just what we need. They obviously care about taking good care of their application,
Intuitive and capable. Integrates well with Alexa. Couldn't enjoy it more.,
the best app i have found on play store to organize and prioritize my tasks and share the same with my friends and colleagues. Thanks to the team for making such a wonderful app.,
"Pretty happy with the app, but reminders are a paid feature. I think they should be free, because they are so basic for a todo app",
"i quite happy after using this app.Before this,I dont know what i should do in my life,everyday feeling guilty for not doing anytjing productive.But now I can set up my goals,the hobbies,learning plan in this app,then I just relax and see at ""Today"" section,i just complete the list then I will be good.Plan my life everyday,complete it everyday.Everyday is moving forward",
"Its the best and cleanest free app in the genre, i especially love it since its ad free and so easy to use, wonderfully designed with the user in mind",
I put everything in todoist. My day does not formulate without it. I know what I need to do next with todoist. Set things to be completed tomorrow or next month. Perfect for a person who needs organization to function......or else we don't know where to start. I love this app. I'll be a lifelong user.,
This app is easy to use and has helped me to get and stay organized. Honestly one of the best time management/to do apps I've ever used.,
Didn't like the interface and deleted the app. It started to sent me notifications to my email. Too annoying,
"Damn man! I am a graduate student in Civil Engineering. In this busy hectic schedule, I have to keep in mind about varoius doings throughout a day. This app surely made it a lot easier for me. Thanks and hats off to the devs. Take love. ❤️",
Can't manage my life without this app. Only issue I'm facing right now is that I get logged out of it often when using it through the chrome extension.,
Easy to use across all devices. Brilliant for keeping everything organised. Excellent app.,
"The free tier could allow more projects. 5 is pretty low. But the app is truly great, the best in this category for me.",
Great app. The only thing missing is tighter integration with Google Tasks (most of my tasks originate from email ang Google makes this extremely easy).,
Todoist has all the features I want and is simple to use. I have high hopes of it revolutionising my organisation and productivity.,
App consistently crashing within seconds of opening. Still crashes with latest update.,
All my unnecessary stress is gone. I tried other apps before but this 1 is the 1 i needed. FREE or $48 for a year ($4/month).. thanks so much for making it!,
Wasted too much of my life trying to get a receipt for my expenses (twice) and finally gave up. Probably because i downgraded back to free. I promise never to use this app ever again. Ever.,
one of the best app if you want yourself to stick to a schedule. put icon of this app on homescreen of your phone so you dont mis your focus and other things will be taken care by app,
I've been using Todoist since 2016 for personal and work projects. I simply love it. Paid my premium subscription yesterday. Couldn't be happier!,
The only to-do app that I need! Just right features with no nonsense. Helps me stay on top of my work and personal life both! Much appreciated!,
"Being able to declutter my mind by putting the tasks I need to do on it, has been helping me sleep better already, since I don't have to keep thinking on all the things I have to do the next day or week.",
"This app is exactly what I was looking for , I have organize my projects and personal life with an eagles view and I don't have to worry about forgetting anything.",
Been using this app maybe for 8 years now and daily for my business ... couldnt ask for any better. Helpsbme tremendously Improve my business This is my first review on play store and it goes to this app because really deserves a bit of my time .,
"Not easy to use at all, especially the reminders. Also, can't put to-dos in calendar.",
I have this on my phone and desktop so it's really straight forward to add and keep track of tasks and set reminders whilst on the go would definitely recommend,
Easy to use and tracks at exactly the right level for me. Premium is definitely worth it.,
"Amongst all free todo apps I've tried, this one is the most simple yet feature rich one. I wish I could have 2 accounts on the app.",
I have been using todoist for years for my personal life. It is my personal assistant!! Juggling all the commitments in life is alot easier using todoist.,
"Not intuitive. I swear items have disappeared. If you want to see what you have already done, you have to pay for premium. No thanks. Back to using Keep.",
"After the new update, adding a task to a section in a project doesn't work. It just doesn't do anything. Samsung Galaxy A52",
Adored this app until they intentionally broke the recurring hourly on completion. Now I have to waste a lot of time looking for another app.,
Excellent app for planning both home and work life. Integration with Alexa and calendars very good and I use this across multiple devices,
I love the app. It has saved me countless hours. It has given me insight into my productivity and has MEASURABLY improved my life.,
Honestly i really love it! Easy and fun to use! I have tried a few to do list apps and this is by far my favorite! And im a picky person.,
"Everything cool and it would be better if we could be able to set deadlines and have more freedom with the date setting (like ""every mon, tue and friday for three months at 5pm"")",
I love the fact that I can create a list of items to do and check them off as I go right here in this app. The notifications are like my own personal secretary. It has helped me tremendously with productivity.,
This app is where I have outsources my brain. My entire life runs on this app and it's so smooth compared to many others. I love how seamless the experience feels between devices,
"can be 5 star but if you add an option to repete tasks and it contains some additional options ( how many times it will repete , 3 day a week , on mondays , ets ) it will be more professional thanks in advance ..",
I've always struggle with planning until this app came into my hands. The integration with G Calendar and the ability to create subtasks makes it easy to mannage your activities.,
I been using this with the getting things done process and it has been a huge win for being productive! It isn't perfect but works better then anything else I have tried to use.,
Todoist is a great app and has grear integration between the mobile app and my gmail account in my browser. it's simple and easy to use. highly recommended,
This app is truly awesome. Best to-do list app I've ever used. I have no problem paying for the premium version. Has definitely added value to my life,
"I am a new user and mostly use the widget, but neither can I tick the DONE tasks nor am I able to create new tasks from the widget. Infact none of the buttons work on the widget.",
Upgraded on Wear OS but now does not open; Edit: the app has been further updated and has fixed the bug described above so increased the rating; Edit 2: Reduced the rating as Wear OS app really slow,
Hi Team Any chance there's a web version I can use in my PC? I'm loving the app so much that it would be handy to have it on my PC to view and sync at all times!,
"Simple, Clear and very helpful. I'm a Graphic Designer and I mostly use the app for managing project tasks and it works very well for me.",
"The app is good, but notification emails are so annoying and can't be stopped. Please fix it.",
Best Experience of recording the to do list and planning my week ahead.. I like the aspect where you can view 7 days tasks together.. Good work guys.. Really appreciate it.,
I'm someone that needs a little bit of assistance to make sure I stay organised and on remain on track. Todoist does the job perfectly.,
"5 star is not enough for review this app! Such a great app of productivity series! I use this app and I find some unique feature than any other to do list app! Afterall, It is a great app for productive to do list.",
I have been using Google tasks for a couple years - switched to Todoist a week ago and I love the change. Grouping by project is a game changer.,
"Great app, does everything it says it would, I would recommend to others who want to follow a planned routine to maximize productivity.",
most organized to do list. and it's so so nice when the free version has so many useful features! thank you!!!,
Very cumbersome to use. Can't even understand how to add repeated Reminders. I happy with ticktick. No switch required.,
"after I updated my android to the new system, I havent been able to tick off one singular task. I have to select multiple. what is the fix for this???",
"Too much brilliance,marvelous and outstanding,as an app developer I strongly recommend,kindly give project limit exceeds atleast ten. Add some alarm notification if todo planned activity occurred.",
Very useful to keep me motivated and helps my time management skills. Wish some features weren't only for premium members like adding comments to tasks.,
Still learning the ropes. But loving being more productive and planning ahead. Great app. And on different platforms. Thanks,
"Thanks for creating this app. It's really good but I hope you can add a ""PLAN MY DAY"" feature where we can easily schedule our today's tasks within the day and a summary monthly view with color tags so we know whicb project are on that particular day. Thanks and God bless",
"Need to make an account, and spammed with emails after signing up. I wanted a to-do list app not a way to sell my data.",
They send email spam without unsubscribe links. Update: You don't consider an email about pricing a marketing mail? That's an Olympic level of mental gymnastics.,
awesome app. I am so much more productive! love it. has changed my day greatly. if you feel overwhelmed and do not know how to start this is perfect.,
"This is a best app made easy. most of the time I accomplish my days tasks because of the email reminders. End now that I write things down i do more, this is must have. Thank team Todoist",
"5 mins in and im already having a bug. Created a new project and clicking on it doesn't do anything, way to go as a first impression.",
I really enjoy this app I use it everyday it is super easy to use and has so many options from board colours to different years.,
I love how easy and intuitive this is to use while being so detailed and thoughtful. I really like the way this app is organized and this will really help with my ADHD,
I am a raw beginner but looking forward to finding out the finer points. Several videos posted online have given me an insight towards what is possible.,
"Free version missing key functions and paid version is VERY expensive now. Unfortunately there are now better, more inexpensive options.",
Please make it possible to quickly switch from the widget to the app. One star to attract attention. Will make it 5 as soon as widgetToAppButton appears.,
I'm using the premium version a few days now. I'm not getting any notifications for my reminders. I checked the menu and everything is fine. Is there something you can do to help?,
The best app for managing your tasks. The Karma motivtes me to do my tasks on a regular basis. Highly recommended!,
I haven't explored everything but what i have i love it. Easy but not plain. I'll give a more detailed once i dig into it's entirety.,
I've been using it for several years now. It's the best. My wife and I are using shared shopping lists with an app widget. Synching is perfect.,
"Its been a year since i last had this app and i must say it is already a majorly huge improvement than what freemium was before. 3 stars since its day one still, but i have high hopes that this will end up with another star or two. Thank you!!!",
Everything is premium. lots of useful things are premium and you actually have to buy them. everything except that is good.,
Never been able to get organized. Todoist is the first system to ever work for me. I'm new to it but it's already become such a part of daily life I think it'll be a real game-changer for me!,
No support for Arabic language from next version... It's gonna be the only to do list with no support for Arabic!! Time to look for a new to do list app.,
"Very useful app for this who can't organize day and has a mess in the plans. Tried for free and like it, now going to premium for more functions. Hope it will help everyone 🎯",
Really good free option. Works well for me and my girlfriend (Apple user) to be able to make and share a variety of lists and information.,
"So far, it's been nice to keep track of projects and things I need to do. I like the sub tasks option and this app is amazing. Thank you developers.",
"Simple design, clean UI, useful for use as GTD and also very powerful when using its filters. The best IMHO.",
Best app for managing tasks. I live by GTD and Todoist is the perfect tool for this. And it's always improving. Love it!,
I've relied on this app for years. For some reason now I can no longer find completed tasks when I search for them. When did this change?,
Now it is working (from my previous review). The integration with smartphone and desktop is really good.,
I can't believe I forgot to rate this app. I absolutely LOVE it. I pair it with Alexa to keep track of the things I need to do. It helps at home and at work. I cant think of anything this app is lacking.,
Very handy. as i have this horrible addiction to look at my phone I thought I might as well use it to improve my productivity. ;-) its smooth.,
"Have been using the premium version for a couple of years now and its the best for organisation by far. Simple, does what you need it to do!",
I've heard such good things and I was so excited to try this app... but it just keeps crashing. My phone tells me it has a bug. Now I'm just disappointed,
I've set up several reminders but none of them went off at the time I had them set for! Figured it out. I have to pay so I'll just find another app.,
Loves it!I will recommend this to other's. I also loved when it stays on my phone screen of the list.I can see it.Good job.I enjpy seeing it right there.I not evrn need to open the app to see my list.I had the theme black.,
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know.",
"Used to be 5 stars, but now you need pro version for reminders? Isn't that a basic feature of a decent to-do list app. I'm changing it to one star.",
Thanks for bringing back the 'open app' button on the widget. Now just let us decide if new tasks should be inserted on top or at the bottom of the list please.,
"It's revolutionised the way I work as a medical student. Makes going from one task to another effortless, allows me to stick to breaks, etc",
This app is awesome for keeping To-Do lists and collabotaing with others. I have the pro version and I find it to be well worth the money.,
"""reminders are a paid feature"" That's one of the most basic feature of a to do app!! Why even bother to have a free version? THIS IS STRICTLY A PAID APP.",
"Super simple to use. Simpler than Asana, plus with both labels and projects, it allows great ways to cross reference. I'm using it to implement GTD with great success",
This app works well and had some adv features. I am only interested in a basic app. It does all I ask very well.,
"it's good, but I can't find list of completed tasks, they disappear from everywhere after completion, is it possible to see them in the app?",
"I have barely began using this app (less than 15 minutes) and I am already in love with the app. The Terms you have to agree to alone are just so assuring and satisfying. Kudos developers, kudos!",
Best todo list app I've ever used. I've been a happy premium customer for over 2 years now. It's well worth the $4/month.,
"Much more polished than Google Tasks. For example you can search for a task, which last time I tried want possible in Google Tasks.",
"This saved me as I journeyed into my career of teaching. So much to do and so little time, this app kept me organised in my new chaotic life!",
Buggy. Also I'm looking for a list with specific alarms and alert to keep me on task daily. Can only get that feature if you pay for it,
"I love it SO much! It's skyrocketed my productivity level & my focus, it's easy to use, & the features in premium are so worth it- thank you to the Todoist Team!!",
"this has completely changed the way I work and get things done at home. makes it easier to get everything done, has just enough of a game element and is easy to use",
"Love this app, just one thing what I don't like is that I can't turn on notifications somehow, so I do have to visit the app every time to see what plans are there written",
"I was already organized, but now it's even better. The connection to drive Gmail and android is the key and why I chose todoist over Omni focus.",
"A piece of garbage considering the hype around it. Without paying monthly or yearly, basic one DOES NOTHING SPECIAL! $5/month to add reminder !!! I get it from Google for free. THIS APP IS GARBAGE!",
I use it constantly to remind me to get things done. I love that I can set times and it will give me notifications. It's the best app I've got!,
"The most basic feature of setting a reminder is behind pay wall. Instant red flag, Uninstalled. I'm not paying a penny for poor design like this.",
"I think it's a really great app, it helps you with planning, it has proved helpful to me as I always need to plan prior to something I do...",
helps me keep track of things I need to do throughout the day. It's very helpful when reminding me what I haven't done the next day as well. Overall this app is great for keeping track of things you need to do.,
You download the app and then have to upgrade and pay for something and you dont even know what it is? No free trail or notification before downloading.,
"useful to remember your tasks. User friendly. many functionalities such as priorities, tags, labels, comments etc.. keeps you motivated with the karma points system",
this app is missing subtasks and obviously no prioritizing subtasks. when subtasks are added if they ever are please make with all the primary task options and a next action option.,
This app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has. The only negative I would say is that I would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free,
"Easy to use, a simple to do list. Next step is to test Slack integration with my team. Will update after results.",
"Fantastic! Really appreciate the new sort functionalities. Excellent app, continuous improvements make app be in the top 1% of Productivity category. Thank you!",
"Great app. Keeps me organized. Can't get it to integrate with my Google calendar yet, but that's not a deal breaker for me.",
Love the app cause it is available on pc too. I have a reauest to the team. Please add an option that a task we add comes everyday.(same task every day) please!!!,
"I use Todoist for uni and personal projects, and it is the best to-do list ever! Kudos to the team who worked on this amazing app! 🤗",
Overrated and not helpful at all especially for people with ADHD. It's really complicated to get by aswell if you do not pay for premium.,
Really easy to use...I can even check my list while on the computer... Really convenient and has helped me get a lot of things done!,
I can complete tasks without being pressured and even just jotting them down and never looking at them again can still remind me that I have to do that task.,
The best task list app on the play store.. Whenever I feel dizzy...I complete my tasks for the sake of this app atleast ... A big thanks goes to its creators...Love you all !!!,
How can i set a task to repeat daily or weekly ?? Thank you for your backup. I have another question? Is there any settings to do to see today tasks in their own project? Like a tittle and then related tasks,
Dear developer Please add 2 more features: 1. Alarm reminder 2. Duration of task and What if I want any task to be recurring but every Sunday off for that particular task only?,
very useful app. would greatly appreciate more flexible karma goal planning like finish 5 tasks a day with priority 2. ie goal planning using queries. is that available perhaps in paid version??,
"it uses an algorithm that understands your timing based on your Task. all you need to do is just write the task like "" I want to book my tickets tomorrow at 9:30"". no need to set the time nothing.",
I am a new user and have only used the app in a minimal way to date. So far I am encouraged to make more use of it to manage my tasks and appointments.,
"Great app. Synchs immediately. Intuitive. Love this app. I've tried a few to do apps, and this one is the best",
Solid daily to-do app. Especially when having the widget on your main screen to tick things off as you go about your day.,
"Really helping my mental health and self esteem journey by making my day more manageable, SMART goals are easily documented and tracked over long term as well through the projects tool.",
Awesome app. A request to the devs: I wish there was some way o take notes in this app that is linked with a task. So it will be better for future reminders.,
"I love this app so much and I use it everyday. Even on the free tier, there's enough features to make this one of the best to do apps out there.",
Love this app. If you use it it helps a lot,
"Very good app, it keeps reminding me every week to do my weekly review, and that's what I do, can't wait to actually start using it properly tho 😅",
Easy to use and full featured. Connects to Google Calendar and elsewhere. Project structure along with Categories and Keywords allow Flexible use. Filters allow you to Zero In on the Key Tasks and Actions to Be Aware of NOW and Here too.,
I use this to organize my study time at home and helps a lot! it's not very hard to use imo. highly recommend:),
so reminder is a premium feature. then just put a price on the app. this feel like a scam. i looked for a simple FREE application here. wasting my time.,
"This is a great app. I installed it two months ago, and I use it everyday. It keeps me awake to all my appointments, and helps me to organize everything. I recommend it to everyone.",
It's just my forth day using Todoist and I'm absolutely loving it! So simple to use plus it's really motivating. Highly recommended! 😊,
Excellent app. Tried everything and this is the best all around productivity app out there. Well worth the premium upgrade.,
"This really helps keep track of my to do items every day. I manage to the day, and not the project, and it really helps.",
"Brilliant application for to do list, notification and mail feature keeps me updated each day help me out to do my work more consistent manner. Thanks devs for this",
Would give it at least 4 stars but I can't. I uninstalled it a long time ago and it still sending me notifications? Idk if it's a glitch but it's annoying.,
"Very good app, but It would be nice if you add lasting tasks, for an example a task that starts at 14:00 and finishes at 15:00 I hope you understood me :P",
"Great organizer, however, too many features require you to have a paid membership, while similar apps don't require any membership fees.",
"Pretty good for keeping to do list - nice interface. Takes some workarounds to make it work for Getting Things Done, but nice. Thanks",
"I'm totally dependent on this app, use it everyday. I wish it was more seamless to move multiple items to the next day, but otherwise great",
The best mobile app I have ever use for everyday tasks. You can customize everything by your own and you needn't pay for it! Incredible!,
I didn't think I would need a to-do app. But it's just nicer to offload reminders. And setting tasks to stop myself from procrastinating.,
"I wanted remainder features and therefore installed it , but unfortunately I didn't get . I was totall disappointed. The screenshot showed had remainder. Please try doing them.",
"The feature of able to detect time, label, & projects on what i typed when editing tasks within inbox is now being removed (auto-detection still available on adding new tasks though) please consider to put it back",
Reminders are a premium feature? No thanks. Id pay a one time fee but subscription for what other apps do for free? No thank you.,
I like the app. But I don't like that they want you to pay for reminder alarms. I would give it more stars if that option was free.,
Best to do list app out there. I have been using it for 3 years already and achieved great productivity with it. Everything is great so far.,
This app is sooooo good for productivity. Love all the features you can use for creating to-do lists. Highly recommend. :),
"It took me a little bit to get started, but it us easy ti move items yo next day as needed. The email reminder is helpful as well.",
It's exactly what it needs to be. A good app for those with ADHD.,
"This app is making me manage better! I love it, specially when I use it on different platforms and web. I definitely suggest it to my friends.",
Crazy fun totally functional to-do-list. Good reminders for anything you need to be reminded of. Sinks with your Google account.,
"Not sure why a todo list app needs total permissions to see everything in my Google account... so no thanks, looking elsewhere. Surveillance capitalism is not inevitable, control yourselves not others!",
"I have only been using this app across all my devices for a few days, and it's the best app I have in my life. It's perfect for business and keeping on top of things!! Highly recommend 💯",
"Useless app, I can't use the reminder. I need to pay to use thr reminder. I hope the reminder, can also available in free version.",
amazing. helpful. i use it for work and personal. it helps me sleep better because my tasks are so organized now!,
"Easy to use for the most part. The only ""issue""i sometimes have is the number of clicks required to access some actions",
"Well, it's a To Do List maker and that's exactly what it does. Love the capability of having a dark theme though!!",
"love it, takes some time to get it set up how you like but its kinda life changing when used in conjunction with GTD. Carl pullein youtube vids are great tutorials",
I love the feeling of ticking off things I've purposes to do and actually accomplished at the end of the day and todoist aids in that great sense of accomplishment. Super grateful,
"Minimalistic, clear design. Very convenient, no bugs, no lags.",
GREAT EXPERIENCE! Note for Devs: Please add true Dark Mode (AMOLED) on both the App and Widget. Options of Font Size for the Widgets would be a great bonus as well! Thank you!,
"When i type some words in the task they just disappear (eg sun) Doesnt allow me to rearrange the tasks under the project, this is a basic feature.",
"Starting last week, the app no longer work on my phone. Even after I uninstalled and reinstalled several times.",
"Still learning how to better use it, but certainly one of the best apps to implement Getting Things Done and free your mind from microtask clogs.",
I use this across platforms and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good and useful to do list app that they can use on any device,
"Fantastic productivity app. I am very suprise how it had change my habit, i am able to do more work on time because of this app. love it..",
Cant unsubscribe from mailing list despite deleting the app. Its very underhanded and for that i will forever trash your app. Give me an option to unsubscribe!!!,
Just amazing. I just want an option to set the list in order that i prefer even if I set them by !!1 !!2 !!3 or !!4.,
"Love the app. Is there a way to remove or reduce the animation (transitions, etc)? I'm autistic and they bother me a bit, I'm always looking for way to reduce cognitive load. Thanks.",
"I really like the app but I'd like it even better, if i could see all the things i've marked as ""Done"" aswell, so i can see how much I've done this day, or so",
Before I could even use the app It demanded my email and Google log in. It's a check list. I'll stick with a notepad that won't steal my data thanks.,
The thing I love the most about this platform is that you can also access your tasks in your computer. Very useful feature for when I can't access my cellphone.,
All good but completed tasks disappear when you tich them and there's no way to find them and monitor completed tasks.,
"It's a free todo app that does not offer a Reminder feature unless one pays for the ""PRO"" version. Deleting it immediately.",
"I cant live without this app, or so until and helps me organise what I need to do so well, its interface and wigets are great too.",
Everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it. A simple push notification and you want me to pay for it.,
Was extremely dossapointed when I had to give up Wunderlist and could not find a good replacement until Todoist! Literally me new favourite organizing list app!,
Best to do list I have come across so far. The way the app grasps keywords especially for setting dates is really cool.,
"That's the best todo list I've tried so far, and it 's surprsingly compatible with ""Getting Things Done"" system by David Allen. Using this is a pleasure .",
Its a great app. I am so organized now.its easy to use. It sends you a email every day telling you what you have planned,
Uninstalled immediately. It said i already had an account. I went through the entire reset process and still couldn't sign in. Waste of time,
"This app is awesome. I have a sugestion, in the app can't see the projects order by folder, will be good can see by folder",
Great app...todoist is a very easy to use and very easy to customize and set up. Highly recommend!,
It has a really useful ability to add sub-tasks to other sub-tasks. Great to use for ordering tasks.,
"Latest update has changed how to set a date and time, and it's not great. Prefer the old version.",
"Great to-do app that does everything you want, also syncs perfectly with planner for Elementary OS.",
"Haven't had it for very long, so I haven't gotten the hang of the scheduling yet. I do like being able to make projects. Nice feature.",
I love this app. If i could add contacts through sharing the app via whatsapp that would make it great... cause i dont have all my friends emails.,
Really good a combination of features that I've looked for in other apps but never found. Really well designed and very intuative to use,
"The app looks really good and it has widgets, but why can't the widgets automatically switch between light and dark mode?",
"Easily the bsst to-do list in the market. Don't be intimidated by the price, which, is pretty cheap. It is worth every single penny.",
very simple design that makes adding a task complex! also most useful features are premium.,
Has its own strengths. Not as easy and intuitive as Trello or Wrike but can handle Subtasking well.,
Todoist is an Outstanding Piece of Code! I highly recommend it!!! It dramatically reduces your stress in life if you use it vigorously!,
"Okay for making lists for tasks due same day, but not much better than notepad.. Very difficult interfacewhen creating long term goals ie not due same day",
"Very useful, but when Google keep is there as another option there isn't much competition , with keep so easily syncing to reminders in wear OS",
Latest update with lower screen controls great and hope others take this lead. Giant phones shouldn't need giant hands.,
Great app with an awesome widget! Love the projects section and the different lists you can make. Helps me get stuff done!,
Excellent app except the large widget. Is there an option to change the text size of the widget and make it a bit compact ?,
"great app, especially because of the syncing between devices! Helped me get my things back in order - seriously.",
Perfect interface that is easy to use. Just enough features for me.,
"Ive been using this for a long time and it has been a joy. However, after a recent update, the widgets stopped working. Able to help?",
Amazing app l. Helps me with everything. Good job paid features. Very helpful widget and little to no distractions.,
It was really nice it really makes me so productive during school and it usually be my reminder if I forgot to make my assignment or the thing that I have to do.,
Love this app. Makes life somewhat easier....so much to do so little time but nice to have someone or something helping you all the way.,
"Best app when it comes to organizing and planning your tasks, great UI , easily syncable across devices",
Fix this asap If we add task widgets on home screen then ..if the task is written long then it gets hide with the dotted lines .... Fix this so that whole statment shall be visible,
I have found this tool to be really amazingly useful for me. It is enabling me to get more done and also keep track of a vast variety of tasks in my work and personal life.,
"I want see my finished task in widget but I can't .I want also add some task that I want to do all days during week, but I have to add this same task every day please add this function thanks for your perfect app",
"I would rate it 4 or 5 star.. but it's just that the main features aren't free... Otherwise you can go for it.. It's an ""OKAY"" app.",
"Very good todo list program. Use it for home, work, and school tasks. Good use of repeating tasks as well",
"This definitely is one of the best app in the market. Although, it would be better if I could sync my other calendars with this app.",
"I've been organizing my life with this for years. I wish I could share lists with people who don't have Todoist, but otherwise super!",
The easy way to keep your schedule flowing and remain on time in a messy world,
a very focused goal-attainment app. it made me think about how my goals were stated and kept me honest about my work.,
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!",
These guys take theirs todo list management very seriously. But they also made it easy to use. Great job! And the free tier does all I need :),
"does exactly what you would want a to.do manager to.do. easy to join, doesnt need huge permissions or try to tie you into other apps. very happy",
I'm an unmotivated highschooler worried about scraping together a graduation: this app has helped me become more productive. It's an excellent tool 🤙,
"Please add support to add a task at any position (something like ""add task below/above"" )this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version",
Have to pay $4/mo if you want the reminders to work. I have ADD. The reminders are the #1 thing I need in a to-do list!,
Hi this is the greatest app ever I'm using for completing task. Can you try to put Voice recorder option as well? If possible.,
I cannot re-edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it. I want to edit it from the text box not from the calender.,
"It's pretty much my one stop shop for all my schedules, reminders and todos. With Google calender sync and IFTTT I have all my GTDs here, including timely reminders to bring an umbrella to work daily if it's raining using IFTTT.",
I love the new design! And the drag-from-the-button gesture is so great! Thanks so much for one of my favorite apps ❤️🔥🙌🏼,
Straight forward platform. We're all on our devices all the time anyway so might as well be productive and this is a great app to do so.,
Uninstalled. This app has 7 user behavior and personal data trackers including a few sending data to Facebook. Todoist obv has no concern for privacy or protecting users.,
Todoist helps me keep organised and keep track of various things I need to get done. It's the best app I found for doing this.,
"It is a good task manager but the font size is too small, especially in the browser.",
"It is very very easy use and after spending hours longing a to do list app , i can say this is the best app i have ever used. Download it and install it i promise you will not regret it",
"""Add Task"" button in project doesn't work unless 👉👉👉 With new update ,I cannot create task under any project (add task doesn't work when project is opened). This can only be achieved by 1️⃣ creating the task in the main dashboard and then moving it to other project which is a hassle. Or another way to directly create a task is 2️⃣ to open app in split screen and then open that project , then only the add task works. Otherwise it doesn't work in full screen",
"Apps like these who include ""on time reminders"" in premium are red flags for me. At least let users get habituated in your app for a week or so & then let them get premium. Why would you want to force people to get premium as soon as they download your app?",
"The tasks do not coninue to the next day, alternate day, week, alternate week etc. I am unintalling it for that reason. also removing it from my watch",
I've tried several different to-do apps and this is the one I've found that does all I need it to do. I've stayed with it and for me that's saying something. the Karma stuff is a bit silly though.,
"great app with 1 recommendation, would like to see this app also include a due date. perhaps its already there but cant see it in the widget versiin, thx,!",
Really useful for tasks but I am unsure how to repeat the tasks and feel like manually typing every day is a bit much.,
Bad experience. The support is the worst ever. And no thought has been put except for the visual ui. The ux is bad.,
"This is my favorite to do list app. I literally use it everyday. Its great, works perfectly, and makes my life so much easier.",
I like it I can plan ahead in advance for things,
This app had helped me a lot in completing my exam preparation schedule!!! I would recommend this app to use..it is very helpful!!!,
"Best to do list app, great options to personalize your workflow and organization, helps me to increase productivity and task management, customer service agents are so so sweet and kind.",
"I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it.",
"Perfect application !! It helps manage all tasks and connect to google agenda, even the free one is full of options ! I REALLY LOVE ITT!!!",
useful free features make this my go to task tracker for personal todos. not powerful enough for professional project management.,
"really really good app - just what I needed. it does have a few little quirks I had to wrap my head around, but overal very good",
"Lovely app for managing tasks and projects, with incredible utilities. The fact that it has a web-app thing for my old tablet is awesome",
"This app provides the common function of to do list. in addition, it organises tasks similar to the way JIRA does, which I am familiar with through work.",
Can't make multiple tasks of the same type for different dates. Have to do them individually which is a waste of time.,
"Just an idea, can it be possible if it contains an app block too like if we select some specific apps we wont be able to access them until we complete our to do list",
"Never had any other app get my things together in very short amount of time. For starters, I recommend using Eisenhower's matrix technique with priorities.",
it's great for reminders and for work . great app,
Love using this but I just wish I could customize the widget more like the opacity and such to make it fit my phone's theme more (I have the premium version),
"This is the best task management app I ever used! It's simple yet complete, it is very aestheticly pleasing. Recomend 100%",
To focus on studying with this app is a brilliant idea cause it reminds you to do homework even more strictly than your teachers. A must-have app,
used todoist for several years. I hate long to do lists and it helps me view the right stuff on the right day so I'm not overwhelmed,
"Great app! It has a couple things I find annoying, that most people probably wouldn't. The developer is quick to respond to any questions I've ever had.",
"I love how easy it is to add items, and that they sync across platforms and devices Also, that I can add them to /through Alexa",
"I've tried dozens of task and habit management apps, and this is the only one I've been able to stick with.",
"Very very useful indeed to keep track of all my project tasks, both business and personal.",
Really helped me to level up my organizing and productivity! I wouldn't need all the premium features really tho.,
simple and does exactly what i need it to without getting in the way. really useful for keeping on top of everything!,
"Great, simple app for managing daily tasks. Keeps your tasks in sync on all devices.",
I rely on it heavily for organizing and remebering tasks. Syncs seemlesly between all of my devices.,
Great app for managing your todo lists. Very intuitive and easy to use.,
"Great, Amazing. If keywords for Due dates, Filters were pickup list, it may easier.",
You can't set up a reoccurring routine and setting an alarm is behind $3 pay wall. Don't waste your time.,
Widget is not working. Will show up but then it freezes and you can't do much with it only remove it.,
Great app! Nice and clean UI. Very useful for monitoring daily tasks. Works awesome for some group projects!,
"If you want a quick and easy to-do list that synchs across platforms, this is for you.",
"easy to use, simple layout. set tasks get reminders tick them off. perfect",
My time management has really improved since using Todoist. I get through tasks strategically through the day and even have some spare time for me 😁,
Seem very friendly app. The only thing I dislike you need to upgrade to pro for reminder/alarm feature.,
"Very helpful, I really felt productive and organized. Easy to use and clean UI and design😊😊",
"Really like the app, and developers are very responsive to suggestions. Does everything I want a task app to do.",
Very fluid and multifunctional. A bit hard to understand at first. Serves its purpose and makes you feel good about it.,
Personally thought this had reminders I could use but cannot without buying features. Considering I have severe ADHD I wouldn't even remember to pay for premiums.,
Im loving this app! Its really helping me get organized! Im really going to need it when i start school this fall!,
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help,
Probably the best piece of software I've ever owned. Both in terms of ui / design and in actual day-to-day usefulness.,
"It is useless if you do not buy premium features. No attachments and comments, no labels, nothing. Piece of trash.",
I love this app. Its such a great way to stay organized and on schedule. I upgraded to the paod version and am loving it :),
The entire point of downloading this was to get reminders. However to get reminders you have to upgrade to premium. Which is stupid.,
there is an immediate problem: to review any of ypur completed task you need to buy a pro version. Then it is not worth to use free version at all,
so easy to use. I wish I could bring back categories I wasn't using before. easy to access on all my devices. absolutely love it,
This app has introduced me to ways to organising I didn't know exsisted. So many options! Exactly what I was looking for and more.,
"Best task list I've come across. Very functional, and I use for work and personal. Best of the bunch",
Can you please add an option to see the caledar (monthly) in order to quickly view the total tasks for the month.,
"I got premium subscription just because hiw convenient this app is! And the price is very reasonable as well- thanks developers, for giving me this opportunity <3",
I was using a different app. for my grocery list. Now I just tell Alexa to add items to my Todoist! So easy!,
"I do not understand why they do not implement start dates, otherwise it is a very good app. The reason for not doing this is not adequate in my opinion. I want to not be able to see some tasks every day and I can accept the risk from being hidden.",
"Great app, nice intuitive design makes it very low friction to use (crucial for a decent todo app), and the natural language input is fantastic",
"Super polished, quick to learn and useful app Using it to manage everything (home and work). Highly recommended.",
"This was a solid replacement for wunderlist, but it isn't simply a to do list. It's more of productive tasks",
"The app should return to the previous version when all sub-tasks could be displayed directly on the ""today"" view (right now this is only possible on a project view)",
"I wish reminders weren't just a premium feature, they should be a basic feature. Everything else is fine.",
Updated review: the developer helped me out in an email exchange so i can put my review back to 5 stars. Haven't been able to find a better to do app than this one.,
I renewed premium upgrade. You now have my money and I don't have access to my created projects! This is one angry customer!,
"I love this app. I may not use all the features but there are some great features that I use everyday, I really think this app is worth a shot for anyone.",
"Most often used app daily! The most reliable, most used app on my phone, laptop and desktop.",
Keeps my entire life organized! I love that I can access the app on my phone and desktop. Definitely recommend!,
"The whole point of such an app is reminders, they are paid features, that's okay. It's very expensive.",
"Please, make an option to use the old style widget. Unfortunartely letters became too small for 4x6 home screen grid.",
Excellent update. Thanks Todoist team. I would suggest customizing the font size on the widget as it seems small.,
"I do not appreciate the automatically added tasks. Also, I cannot save a task unless I am in the middle of editing thd tags which is not helpful",
Filters stopped working after the latest update. Logging out and logging in back fixed the issue.,
I love this app with all my heart :) it is absolutely perfect! Thank you for creating it! Stunning work!!,
"The App was really amazing but it keeps shutting down everytime I open it, I have tried to re-install but was still unsuccessful",
Best To Do(L)ist app I've found yet. Customer support is quick. The latest UI is 🥵🥵 Appreciate the free features! Kudos to the Team.,
I wish i could see completed task in my list just tick or cut off. I don't like the fact that it disappears to completed section,
"A ""free"" app that charges for notifications. Basically useless if you're unwilling to pay.",
"works for my girl and I. she's a planner and I'm a doer, so it saves us the long beaurocratic meetings about what needs done and instead of TALKING about tasks needing completed, I just DO it, which is more my style.",
"Capturing the gold. So good to have a means of capturing those fleeting thoughts throughout the day, which sometimes lead to gold.",
"used to be my favorite apps, but sync bugs drove me crazy too many times, auto replace link with title made me mad, cancelled subscription & uninstalled",
I've been researching To-Do List apps for myself and clients for years... this is the absolute best!,
"I've tried a lot of organisation apps and this is my favourite, just really simple, easy to use and effective.",
"I am a busy person with lots of different responsibilities: three jobs (including a business co-owned with my wife), three kids, church, and a doctorate program. Todoist just helps me find some order and not go insane.",
"Incredible. Takes some up front effort to learn, but I now organize my entire life with this tool. Seriously.",
I love it. it's amazingly helping me organising all my tasks and life. Moreover it is make me becoming more focused and reliable,
This app helps me plan my important tasks and keeps me reminded when needed but the only thing is that there is a problem with setting manual alarms for certain scheduled tasks,
"Love it, used to use Asana, Toodledo, Trello, DGT GTD but this app does it all more easily, quickly and cleanly. It basically organises by life now!",
I find Todoist so easy to use. It is so straightforward and useful. the application is very effective and well laid out. I'm so glad that I have it.,
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved.",
"It's really good. I dont want to have to pay for premium and I wish I could see the tasks I've completed, but at the same time it works really well for what I need it for.",
"In my opinion is one the best todo apps that I ever download on my phone If you ask me why I think so? Because for me, firstly, in todo apps only the incentive to tackle the task matters to me. That's one of them",
"A brilliant little to do manager! Check out the free version, then upgrade if you like it.",
"Extremely complicated to use. can't understand a thing. good app, but it needs a whole tutorial because it does so much",
Subscription model for to-do list? Are you a joke. Upd: figure out that most of the things are not hidden behind paywall change from 1/5 to 4/5. Still can't justify subscription model,
"Just uninstalled it It looks a great app, but one its fundamental features (reminder) was available only in premium mode.",
This used to be such a good app until they implemented a poorly thought out sort functionality that renders any 'living' list almost unusable.,
"Easy to use, and I love the way reminder pops up on the screen everyday and doesn't let you forget your duties!!",
Great app. simple but very effective. being able to use the app and the online version interchangeably is very useful,
"Great app, easy to use, you can schedule times and create priorities. I highly recommend.",
Tried as few. Todoist works the best for my needs. Love the Alexa and calendar integration.,
Very intuitive. The integration with google cal is the reason I came back.,
"Good overall user experience. It was unfortunate they removed metric tracking, however. Otherwise, great.",
"Intuitive UI, very easy to use (though difficult to master!).",
"The best to do list app ever, I already had used others, but no doubts this is the better, minimalist, simple and faster!",
I love it! Would just be great if it also had a function where you can see your tasks in Calender format,
just started. great so far. better for college than chipper if you make each class a different project.,
"tried a few of these apps, this one seems the most intuitive and feature rich. has a linux desktop client too, community maintained",
"i like it because i can just put down my todos as they arrive during the day and organize them in my calendar later. as suposed to seting it all in my calendar, wich takes time",
I'm a grad student with lots of tasks and like time. Todoist helps me to effectively manage the little time I have.,
"I've only been using it for a week, but so far it has been fantastic. I love the design, and more importantly I have been significantly more productive since I started using Todoist.",
Loved Todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me. Can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore.,
"It's a good assistant for daily life. But I don't like, that in there's a premium upgrade for money.",
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.,
My favorite app on Android! Great planning app. Fast bugfixes. Often new cool features appears.,
Great for More Productivity,
Okay I was happy until the sound on my in app tutorial did not work 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ Of course with assistance this review can change.,
Have to have this for the edge bar panel which I purchased now I have to purchase this to use the specific features I wanted for the panel. Should be more upfront about these things people.,
"Love it. It's bit annoying that windows desktop application is not working but otherwise, it's awesome.",
"it technically does most of things you would want a list app "" to do "", but it seems to make them a bit tougher than other apps, or charges",
"Actual dogshit, spent a good portion of time setting up tasks for it to be all deleted the next day, nice job with the unintuitive menu",
"i like this app but the real reason I'm leaving 5 stars is in an attempt to stop it sending me notifications asking if i like it, even after leaving a 4 star review!",
My organisation skills have never been as good before I used this app. Its on all my devices. Makes sure every day of the year is not wasted,
"i love this app so much, helped me to finish my tasks on time way better! people who have a hard time trying to organise their tasks should try this app!!",
"One of the best apps I used in my whole life. Superb, thoughtful, subtle design makes you want to use it, and this is the key!",
Using the free version which is very good! may update to the pro version for the premium features! Definitely recommend,
Started using this app years ago in Chrome. Simple to use and does what you want with great flexibility.,
So helpful! Love the latest update that lets me indicate a completed task in one click. I depend on this app.,
"Its good for making lists, but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium, its just not for me",
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled.",
I been with out the Alex integration for a loong long time. I just got so use to using todoist. Now I'm moving to any.do and back with the Alex integration. Bye Todist!,
"i wish it supports smartwatch os as well where i can add, complete and modify the tasks thru my watch.",
The best to-do app,
"Optimal for work and private, a good Tool to stay on track while your 100 Tasks are burning your head. Write them down in todoist",
"Amazing app, after using tons of todo apps, I'm sticking to this one, checks all the boxes for me.",
"I couldn't figure out a way to sync with my Google Tasks, and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch.",
best app . and a small request that I want a reminder for my tasks because reminder is a premium version.. 🙏🏿 .. I like this app but more than other app ..😊👍🏻,
"excellent detail, organization and support in managing the details of life. also good link a d coordination with calendars.",
I've tried a lot of task tracking apps! Todoist have every essential function I love all combined in one app!,
"Difficult onboarding, no integration with google calendars, documentation is not very clear.",
It's a good app love the simplicity and layout of it but I don't think reminders should a Premium feature.,
Great app to keep you organised. Love the integration with Google calendar which ToDo doesn't have. Easy migration from Wunderlist.,
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...,
"Good, simple, clean, fast and easy to use, i prefer to choose a cold color like sky blue or turquoise because cold colors are more comfortable and calm",
"The widget stops working suddenly and doesn't show tasks. It says ""no tasks. Anything to add?""",
"Nice app, useful and easy to use. The free version has lots of options to serve the goal.",
"Had this app during college and it great to quickly add in things to do and also to have schedule projects, very clean and easy to use",
Near perfect app for boosting your productivity. I love it despite the developers breaking some features while updating.,
It is a nice app. But I don't like the fact that an alarm is a premium feature. But other than that everything works fine and great!,
"the only thing im not a fan of is the fact that there is a premium version, id prefer all to be free. however the free features are still supurb!",
free version has a lot of functionality but i do plan on paying after a few weeks of using it... just to see if i will use it consistently,
"I use premium! It has really all the features you want from task manager: GTD support, tags, hierarchy, Google calendar integration etc. Great product!",
Amazing...keeps on task and love the ease of using this ap. Love the Karma levels...makes motivated to get more done. I will reach Enlightened!,
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding me? This is an absolute deal breaker. I deleted after trying for 2 minutes.,
brilliant app and easy to use! have premium as a free trial but will definitely be paying to keep using it!,
"Love it. Has all the features i was looking for, yet still easy to use and available on all platforms.",
"love it, highly recommend it. it makes my life so much smoother, very easy to use and clean interface.",
Awesome app.. nice and simple to use. It really makes my to do tasks easy to manage and gets things done.,
"It's simple and to the point, but has the power to get complex when needed to. Loving it right now!!",
Good app but not very user friendly. Reminders behind a paywall and no way to repeat tasks :(,
very nice even in free version. I wish though that free version would have more unlocked features like comments and stuff.,
why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date? i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date.. can this be fixed???,
"Great, intuitive app. Helping me with time management and productivity.",
I like the regular updates. It shows that the Todoist team doesn't stop trying to make the app better.,
"great app! Really helped me feel happier and more productive! Makes it easy to plan out your day, week or even month!",
Easy To Use! I've been using it for the entirety of my college career. So easy to use and helpful to not have to carry around a giant calendar.,
It can not even start normally: Im clicking loflgin via email but nothing happened. I can not trust productivity app who fors not work from the beggining,
Excellent app but expensive - Charging an annuality for a service very similar of what Microsoft To-Do is offering for free now is something that needs to be considered.,
App sucks. Will not open. Kind of hard to cross off items from my to do list when I cannot access it.,
Very helpful tool for clearing my brain so I can focus on what is most pressing in my week with less mental fatigue.,
"So, when will you guys add a ""do when"" feature as well as a ""due date""? Like Things 3 has. Can you please consider it? Perhaps something similar?",
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review,
"I love this app. It's easy, intuitive and makes managing a schedule very easy",
"I would much appreciate a ""for later"" category for tasks that I have to do, but I haven't decided when to schedule them. like in the app anydo..",
"Simple, intuitive and yet quite useful. Oh, there is also no ads.",
"I would give todoist more than five stars; However, you keep ignoring users for enabling them to show completed tasks by default is just irresponsible, please add an option to always show completed tasks!",
The app keep crashing everytime I tried to create a label. But the app look interesting. Too bad 😔,
"Easy to use, would like to have desktop version that will sync with mobile.",
5 trial projects... There were much more and than they reduced the amount of project to increase sales. Also price is too high.,
Wished there's pomodoro timer function like ticktick or focus to-do. Hoping more features will be added on premium.,
Love this app was using a planner but I'm 100x more productive it's super simple but also very complex at the same time learn new things about it all the time 10/10,
Very useful and does the job. It's a shame some features are in the premium version.,
Missing the possibility to easily enter repetitive tasks without having to put the same task every day/week/month manually.,
"Has been the only app that had helped keep me organized, I have tried many, this one is very flexible.",
"Alexa shopping list integration is rubbish, items are added correctly but if an item is removed by another user they never leave the list.",
"Super useful, have been using the free version for a few weeks and feel like I have more control over my schedule.",
Thee absolute best task app I've ever used. Does everything you need and more omce setup with the GTD (Getting Things Done) principles.,
Almost perfect. Has some annoying quirks but it's the best task manager I have found so far.,
Make the program free without any pro features And then make a lot of people happy,
Great app. Helps me organized. Would love to see a better UI. Great app overall. I would keep it installed,
Excellent. Changed my appreciation of how much I can achieve in a day. Truly a game changing app. God bless you all mightily in Jesus name!,
Very nice format for constructing to-do lists. Have tried many and this is one of the better ones.,
"It's okay. Easy to use, just wish incould add a topic/note header toneach individual note.",
Best app for productivity boost. You have only what is needed in a really simple to use interface.,
"Highly recommended to focus attention in the many roles we play each day in our work, family, and personal lives. Suggestion for users: Add a task to check Todoist with #daily!",
Great. But it would be nice if the Android app icon had a count of tasks for today like the windows version.,
this app has been so amazing I paid the extra for premium and to be able to ha e scheduled push notifications. highly highly recommend!,
good app! I guess I miss some of the premium features in my free version but that's the order of things 😋,
This app is really useful. This app had helped me achieve more productivity. Loving it. Best for students.,
"Great app, ima kid. My family makes me watch videos about jesus each day and I do online school. There could be improvements but it truly is a great app.",
"Good, but you should allow to set default date to tomorow when creating new task. I schedule what todo usually the day before.",
"Wonderful app across all devices, not much is behind a paywall. Best free to do list with great integrations",
"super helpful, easy to utilize, smooth navigation. a great asset to any job.",
"great app, dinged 1 star for cost... but perhaps worth it as its the only wear os watch + mobile seamless integrated to-do/ task app there is.",
"The best. No matter what device I'm on, I can capture every idea, every thing to remember, and find what is important to do now.",
"Fantastic to-do-list app, just what I was looking for. It's so intuitive and does more than you need it to do",
"Love the fluidness and simplicity. Not too much, not too little... Just right. #goldilocksapproved",
"Quality, easy to use app for organizing tasks. Actually stuck with one for once!",
This app is plain and simply a great way to organize your day and very easy to use!! 10/10 recommend!! 👍👍,
"great app ! i find the widget really useful and also the features , they have a stufent discount too which is awesome !",
"Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders.",
"Very easy to use, nice, simple interface. Nothing to extra",
No free trial. Notifications don't work. User interface is not user friendly.,
"easy to use, fast enough to set tasks but simple features are put in premum mode.",
"This app is useful and make my day productive , it should have voice listening so that we'll just have to tell our work and day nd time nd it will automatically schedule than it will become much easier nd convenient",
Not bad but keeps on deleting my recurring tasks... Which makes it unusable for me. I need something to remind me of it... Not to be adding them daily,
I paid for the subscription and now it doesnt show up under manage subscriptions for me to be able to end my subscription!!😡,
"Very. Useful user friendly app to organise meetings, handy reminders to keep you focused.",
"It's helping me in my day to day activities, and facility to add subtasks and daily mail update makes it more valuable.",
"Good app, but lots of stuff was pay walled. Worked fine, but there might be a better option for free somewhere.",
The app is very good and literally helping me to stay productive and record my achievements and to stay aware of what I want to and but I have a concern is that I love to see the analytics of my work but in this app I am not getting in the more analytic like I want my monthly analytics just like there are day analytics for days and B okay so my basic concern is please add more analytic,
Does not let you use reminders in free version which should be a basic necessity for any productivity app!,
Why Free features like alarm are premium now ? Can't find widget and after leaving from the beta the install button disappeared. It's been 1 day I leave from beta testing,
It's a great app to chart your productivity.... Simple easy to use features make it all the more accessible.,
Great! Really intuitive interface and the natural language comments work like a charm :) very happy!,
So helpful. Keeps me organized and i don't forget anything and the tips and blogs are also really helpful. Love it.,
reliable and easy to use,
My favorite cross platform ToDo app by far. Alexa ToDo integration is great and sharing list with family members is the icing on the cake!,
Great app. The best thing is that you have both calender and to do list on one app. But can add Persian calender as well?,
"Free version has some limitations, but great productivity app so far--longest I've kept one going on the phone yet...!",
This is the absolute best todo app or website i have ever used! It has so many great features to organize tasks.,
The free version has a minimal functionality. There more advanced free apps on the PlayStore.,
"Todoist is really useful if you have a variety of tasks that you need to carry out, but don't want to write it down on pen and paper.",
This is the best app when it comes to to do...the free version is ok...,
"I need an account to store my data on your server? no local copy of my data? I can't work on my data offline? you want a monthly fee to retain my data? sorry, I need an app where I retain control of my data and you can't see that data. sell me an app, not a subscription service. uninstalling.",
I wish the time setting was easier. I always seem to duplicate the entries somehow.,
"Integration with Outlook, web browsers, and other tools really makes this the best activity tracker I have used.",
"I love this app! I use it to keep track of all my assignments for my college courses, as well as to keep up with maintaining my daily life.",
Highly recommend if you're like me and have trouble remembering things. Just waiting until i can afford premium!,
"Despite its bad UX on the web (e.g. it's a pain to add tasks to projects, Trello-like shortcuts would help), I like this app a lot!",
"that doese what it says, even free version gives plenty of options. can share a list among others and keep track thank you",
"This is amazing, it has been helping me to keep track of what I was supposed to do according to the plan that I designed. Thank you for making me be mor focused on my daily routine!",
Great app to organise your days in tasks by the hour! Very useful for busy people that wanna keep track of their productivity.,
Requires a sign up/login. How about an option for offline only. If an app requires a login it gets uninstalled immediately.,
"Easy to use, quite intuitive and not littered with advertisements. Win-win in my book.",
"I have tried a lot of todo apps. This app have everything i need, eccept making multiple list... Instead I have to make multiple projects.",
IFTTT integration makes this the best talk management application available. You can shorten the usual long Google commands to be short and sweet making among notes to TiDoist with your voice a breaze,
Its been 2+ years i am using Todoist. Thank you for this amazing app. It boosts my productivity and help me remember my tasks.,
Easy to use and great format with different levels of importance and goals to keep you on track,
"It's a great app for keeping me focused. I use it every day. I enjoy the karma levels, too. it makes everything feel more like a game.",
I like that you value privacy. So I'm disappointed that tasks within a project can't be broken down into more tasks. The comments feature doesn't seem to be enough of a supplement.,
"Recently moved from Wunderlist to Todoist. Very pleased with Todoist, especially the recurring task feature.",
if we could input estimate hours and actual hours for each task. and get summary on finished tasks each month. that will be perfect.,
Excellent. Very helpful with keeping track of things and is a perfect online checklist in my opinion,
"Not compatible with older Samsung tablet. What a crock, it's a to do app. Explain why Wunderlist can run but not this app...",
"I wish i could have started using this app earlier. This app is freaking so good. 10 star This app should editor choice app Genuine review Abhinav From india Just one request, premium version side little bit on pricey side. I can understand developer cost. If price is reduced, more people will start opting for premium side.",
its great to keep track of the things you have to do and it allow you to seperate things by projects.,
Incredible app. It's really helped me be a lot more focussed and productive with work and general life.,
"Using the app solely for daily tasks (creative work, exercise, cleaning). Works well enough for that.",
"Nice app, decent sublist setup, yet a little confusing, possibly me not understand doing his it works. Good app, just not ready to pay at this time.",
I use it every day to organise myself - couldn't do without it. The best organising app that I've found.,
Satisfied. But to me too little functions for free version. I'm not able to judge whether I'm ready to pay for full version,
"I love the flexibility of this app. There are a number of ways you can choose how you see and enter info, yet it is very easy to use.",
its really good for reminders of some important tasjs and for creating a daily to do list and tracking one's progress and dedication towards his/her progress.,
this does not work im a student and i forget things easily so yesterday i put task and add them for today and they werent there so after that i added a task today it aint show up so 0 stars.,
Their team won't add sorted by date ascending/Descending or created date of task since 7 months ago I created email their team about suggestion. Bec it's lack of focus without this.,
This is a very simple and powerful self-managemnet tool. I can add a new task at anywhere.,
Three stars because we can't set time to get a notification from a task. Please add that option even for the free users,
great for planning!. I was the caterer for a memorial reception. Todoist helped me to outline event and prep schedule to deliver food for the event. Love this tool!,
"It has helped me so much with school, and the google calender integration makes it even better. Thank you!",
Very intuitive interface. Love tracking tasks in it. Fun!,
Great app so far. It does some stuff that I'm not crazy about but it sorts thing well and keeps track of everything I need it to.,
Excellent app. Helps me to organize my day and remind all activities I have. Works good online and offline.,
The app's not opening. It always is having an error. Each and evrytime I'm installing it.Pls look into this problem.,
"Easy to use laid out to be user friendly, mixed bag on email reminders. All in all a helpful application",
"Does exactly what I want it to do, it's easy to use and a good reminder for my various taks and errands.",
An essential part of my life / brain. I especially rely on the widget to quickly add tasks.,
"Would loooooove the option to be able to add items that are not necessarily tasks, just notes I don't want to forget.",
"This is a great app.I use the free version, I know there are many features that I don't get to use due to that fact, but it does what I need for the most part.",
"Great organizational tool, really helps you define the steps and timetable for each of your goals.",
Easily the best task manager. And I've tried about 15 of them. Even works with Google assistant.,
Really like it. I can organize all of my tasks easily and across platform. Keep up the good work,
"Intuitive, easy, and motivating! Great to use on multiple devices",
I hate that marking a task as completed doesn't automatically mark the sub-tasks that were part of it as completed too.,
Riddled with bugs and the UI gets more and more unusable as time goes on.,
"I very rarely leave reviews, but this app has had a dramatic positive influence on my day to day productivity, I highly recommend it!",
I have tried many to do list apps. But this is the best. Just renewed my premium subscription,
It opens but won't let me add the to do tasks I need to keep track of. I uninstalled than installed pocket brilliance which is close to perfect,
So far everything has been working well. I don't really need the premium features so everything that's available for free is just enough for me.,
"Love the interface. easy to organize with combination of projects, tags, and priorities.",
Im in love with this app soo much .but one disappointment is that it is not fully free .i was ble to put only 3 projects.but daily use of this app is perfect.,
Excellent! I found it really convinient to be able to edit my to do list both from my phone and my laptop.,
"A very helpful app. I'm using the free version, it would be nicece to have an sms type notification system.",
integration with Google calendar is pretty good and combining that with a pomodoro timer is great for productivity.,
The app is good but 50$/y for premium is simply ridiculous. So frustrating to have to move to another app.,
The most well rounded task manager app out there. Premium necessary for most features but is well priced for students like myself,
Todoist & GTD methodology has completely revolutionized my life and my way of doing things. Forever grateful for this software and the GTD methods that it helps me apply.,
Overall the best to do list app to organise your daily schedule. Actually helps in easily completing the task.,
"Todoist helps me to manage my tasks and to control my productivity, especially I really like collaboration feature. Good job guys.",
"One of the best apps ever, I've tried plenty of to do apps but using todoist for years I simply cannot live without it.",
It's a simple to-do list app. Exactly what I needed. Without annoying adds and very simple,
"Very helpful with creating tasks, prioritizing, and execution. Great tool to have for organization!",
Latest update has broken the app and made it unusable. Creating a task makes the app crash.,
Update: Recent version 9498 has bought the app back to its reliability on older Android versions. Thanks for your persistence.,
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.,
"An app the puts me on the, with Todoist I break down big aims into small tasks per day helping me enjoying the progress Its the best out there, after I've tried several",
"Ultimately the best to-do list. I've been using it since years already. Highly recommended. Noone paid me to write this. I pay Todoist for Premium version, though.",
"Sorry but I won't install this app before you do install it check this app and privacy concerns, check under the tab about this app permissions and you can see that it has more or less acces to all your phone's information that sucks no thank you.",
Very confusing User Interface I tried to add a few tasks but so its confusing I decided to uninstall it and not to mess it anymore.,
"Reminders are a PREMIUM feature for some ungodly reason. They are a must for a todo app, what's point of writing it down if you keep FORGETTING it?!",
It spams your mailbox with reminders and it isn't obvious how to unsubscribe. Not very user friendly. AVOID.,
"Very useful. One can make tasks repeat, and rank them based on priority.",
On the free version. Very intuitive and has made a difference to my organisation. Thank you!,
My go-to app for taking note of my college assignments and exams! I won’t turn back to any other app cuz Todoist is just THAT good.,
The free tier is close to useless and coming from Ticktick I found Todoist pricier and work fewer features.,
"Found something that works with me, not against me. I'll never find a perfect solution, but I keep trying and todoist is the closest to my ideal method.",
Great app over web and mobile. I love the ability to sync with my Google Calendar!,
"Best task manager I have used. Simple, straightforward and works seamlessly across platforms.",
I just want to put a time in the task without it triggering the date function... it's too good at its job,
Love Todoist. Use it every day on desktop and phone. The widgets could be better but the app is amazing,
Need to pay to get reminders? The whole part of a to-do list is too be reminded. It's so pay to win =/,
"A lovely nice looking interface but one that isn't cluttered and confusing, just what I want in an app like this",
Nice and lightweight tool for my personal project and weekly todos. Some small ui quirkiness which is only why I don't rate it 5 stars.,
"Pretty good app, but crashes sometimes if you do something unexpected EDIT:contacted you with a crash description",
Amazing App. Does exactly what I need to capture and organize all that I need to do as an executive.,
Great app. I use it to remind myself of payments i need to make. Very simple to use and also handy.,
Good app too organize yourself. Not spammy. I get one notification a day. One in the morning and thats pretty much it,
"Great App! Purchase Plan, i.e. subscription, the necessity to subscribe guarantees that I have no way to have it.",
"Powerful and flexible, Todoist has the best feature set of the various productivity apps I've tried thus far",
"This is the best app for task management. I love the UI, especially the dark mode.",
"This is a really good app, the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do.",
First day of really actually using the app and they want me to rate it. so far the app works good. I haven't used it much at all.,
A really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it.,
The Best! No doubt this is the best todo management app. It has all the features I want. Todoist has the best UX!,
"Great app, switched from iOS to android and the app I used before isn't on android. Minimalist is great, I think this app is a step ahead.",
"Worth every cent. I don't regret paying for the premium. Being honest, this app is an essential part of my productivity.",
"Vry good app, tho I was just deleting one of my tasks at night and almost got a heart attack from the sound it made 3 seconds after 😂 😅imma find out tmrow if theres a setting",
Very helpful for school and organizing. This has been my go-to app for the past few years <3,
Good way to organize all my tasks. Love the rescheduling option and weekly view !,
"Game changer. Most productive I have been in years, primarily use the upcoming view and schedule tasks.",
"I tried several To Do List apps, and I like this one the best. I especially like the option to assign priorities.",
Easy to use and helpful for keeping track of my schoolwork and personal goals.,
"Would like more options for when I can view things but overall, one of the best productivity apps on Android.",
"Back to being the best Todo app. Had some issues in the past updates but got fixed very fast with this update, good one!",
Best app of all time.,
"Great, but lacking moments feature - still you can simulate this technique by adding recurring tasks which remimds me to review my todo list",
Great. Minimal. Sublime.,
Great app to organize your tasks and plan your day. I'm very satisfied with the premium features as well.,
"Stops midway, no response for days.",
"Looks good, works well (except on windows) and nice calendar integration.",
very good app.,
Gets the job done. Simple and highly efficient - no learning curve.,
Use this app to keep track of all my school due dates - simple app I can access from anywhere. Love it!,
Easy to use. The layout is good. I used this app for homework tasks and errands at home.,
Quick and simple to use. I especially like the long press on the app icon to add a task quickly,
"It really has a minimalism design and functionality, as I prefer to be. Helpful app, thanks devs!",
Gets the job done very well! Helps keep track of things necessary and streamlining is awesome!,
"This app was so amazing. I don't feel disappointed after downloading this app. Actually, it is simple and great. Keep up the good work. (Sorry for my bad english 🙏😓)",
I have just uninstall it cuz you have to pay to get the basics options. If i can give it -5 stars i will do it. shame!!,
It's disappointing that basic things like reminders are a paid feature.,
"What good is a todo list app without a reminder, why would you make the most important thing a premium feature. Don't download this app it's USELESS!!",
I'm using this app for a few week now. It's the best app I've ever used for my to-do lists and schedule. Beyond my expectations.,
"Brilliant App, seems extremely intuitive, i find using this app keep everything organised which helps with busy lifestyles.",
"I find the app very comfortable and easy to use. I recommend using it, as it very meaningful and helpful for me!",
The only task management app I have been able to use for more than two weeks. Now at 4 months. Love it!,
"Great I'm still working out a solid work flow, but there have already been drastic improvements in my organization and productivity",
I've been using this for years and it helps me stay on top of my daily tasks! I would give it 6 stars if I was able. Definitely recommend this application.,
"First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app.",
"Doesn't display instances of recurring tasks, making it totally useless for forward planning. Uninstalled.",
"it helps me to manage our day to day things.& also didn't let me to forget things that I have to do. thank you & a better app, so anyone could have this.",
Downloaded to test alarm /reminder capability but was unable to trial without paying. Come it wouldn't kill ya to offer Pro features for a week,
"Exactly what I was looking for. Free version is sufficient for most use cases, and the full version is great!",
There are better options available. I just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app. I tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and I am going to try another.,
I only use it for simple reminders and lists but it works great and syncs across all my devices,
Adding a picture to a task is a paid feature... So free version is not great.,
it's been a best app to keep track of the planned task. I have been using this app for more than 5 years or so. I couldn't use and found any other app like this.,
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme.",
an amazing app. very well built and really helps my productivity. I highly recommend you give it a try!,
We use it for running our home & project improvements. It is easy to use.. not as user attractive as some but ok.,
Already such a great app and then you guys release more premium features for the free version. You guys are the real MVPs!,
one suggestion: allow the return key to work so as to make a vertical list under one entry. Other than that it's 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,
Looks great but reminders need a pro subscription. This is what I basically wanted the app for. Uninstalled it.,
"Haven't tried it yet, but give me some time to analyze it's performance.",
Great app! I use it every day. I use a list for everything. I love having different types of lists too.,
Had to use email or other login to start using. Not great when i want to see if the app is any good. Uninstalled instantly.,
"App is good, but it's stuttering in my phone. Kindly update it and make it smooth.",
useful so.... way to schedule and add i often do .. reschedule stuff. keeps a good running list of this things i need to get done,
So far so good. Helps organize my scattered thoughts and keep track of what I should prioritize.,
"great app💖 but I think more can be done considering aesthetics, things like making the home screen widget transparent and so on :)",
Very good. It's worth using properly. Take a little time to learn everything about it and you will find that you have more time and less stress.,
"Simply the best organizer app I have ever, ever had. It changed my life forever. I just can't say how greatful I am for this app. Thank you!",
Great app. Wish it would sync with a few more business tools but it is a great organization app.,
"Such a nice app to keep you on track every step of the way, too bad half the features on it are for paid subscribers only,",
"Just started using, really enjoy it the more and more I organize my projects. Will update again in future.",
Full power app! Sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own. Otherwise amazing.,
Good app for keeping track of things. Wish it'd be easier to make notes on specific tasks.,
The Android app is a bit buggy: when switching view the task list remains frozen on the previous view until you scroll or tap.,
"Just needed somthing to record things I have to do and to remind when I should do them, then got hit instantly with a paywall, not a cool start tho.",
"Quick to add to dos, organize them and move them around. I'm quite forgetful, and this keeps me effective.",
Great app with a simple to use platform. Keeps all of my to dos in priority and organized for a steady productive day.,
"Very simple and intuitive. Easy to organize, and clean ui.",
Delightfully clean interface and a great range of features even in the free edition,
Love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now I do not get reminder for anything on time.,
find the reschedule function especially helpful. it's been a superb tool so far.,
"Team , I took subscribtion but app is not working. I try to add task but I can't see the text etc. Something is wrong.",
Really enjoy keeping track of my tasks so easily. Fills my need for accomplishment by checking off completed tasks.,
"This is a wonderful app, thanks to which I became very and very organized. I am grateful for its creation to its developers!!!",
The best productivity app ever used. My day starts with this app. Well designed and continuous improvement makes it the best app.,
I use the free version and it's very easy & helpful with adding tasks & reminders.,
"Easy, useful app that connects all my platforms. Makes connecting in the business a breeze",
"Very good but could be better e.g. sync with google calendar, tag people in tasks (not just on shared projects).",
Very good and practical to-do list app. I am using the free version and it is doing what it should perfectly.,
"It's a great app! But the main thing is, it is easy to use. And also, it automatically recognises the date I have set. So, I'm giving it 5 stars.",
Great app. Used it to run projects at work as well as day - to - day task. Have great control regarding day.,
The app is good. But I am unable to sync it with Google calender on my phone. Please help,
Werry cool app to memorise things that you need to do. I recommend this app for everyone that don't want to write tasks down on real paper.,
"Its a great app, but I can't give it 5 stars because the app asked me to rate it and I don't want to reward that behavior. Devs if I really want to rate your app you won't have to ask stop begging me to rate your app. Cut it out.",
Unhappy with the paid version. The reminder function isn't straight forward and hasn't worked for me,
A beautiful piece of software. It's only downside (which is an upside to some) is that it's SaaS.,
Widget buttons do not work,
Solid to do list app. Even at the free/intro level I don't feel super constrained.,
"simple, easy to use and not bloated with useless options or features. I love it!",
It's great at organising my project's tasks for home DIY and helping me get a lot more done in a note efficient way.,
I have uninstalled this app and unsubscribed from emails and yet it continues to send me emails. FIX THIS AND STOP SENDING ME EMAILS!!!,
I'd like to try apps that don't require an initial log in to see how to use.,
I'd like a faster option to delete tasks instead of selection and using the side menu.,
I've tried a bunch of to-do apps and this is my favorite to date. Versatile without getting too complex.,
Thanks for this very helpful tool,
It's great both as a free user and premium. I've tried both. My favourite app for keeping all lifes task on,
Condensed widget is amazing. Really good use of the space and a confirmation popup to prevent misclicks.,
"It's got a lot of features, even though a lot is in premium it's got everything to keep everything organized.",
Very easy to use and the best app in this category. I had this app on iphone and now I install on my new android. Todoist makes me an organized person :),
Love it. Recommended by a class I took on productivity. Huge boost to my planning and way lower stress.,
"Best ToDo list, has projects, priorities and integrations like Google Calendar sync. Use it daily and love it",
"Like it, helps me a lot. Just sometimes it opens on Today despite my project is customized as landing page.",
"Good app, I have used it steady for a couple of months now. The filtering feature is handy",
"Todoist suddenly starts reminding me that I have no tasks for the day. I have all notifications off, stop that!",
Great way to track personal projects and be motivated to complete the steps. Really love this app!,
Really nice app. Very user friendly. 5 stars when subtasks are usable (when I can view them on my daily task list),
Seriously? Reminder is a premium feature? What's the point of all this then? 1 star. I can understand comments and labels but reminders? At least other paid apps give reminders.,
"good clean app, would be nice if there's an option for loopable tasks (daily/weekly/monthly/twice a week)",
"Best ToDo app from the ones I've tried. Elegant: everything you need is there, but there is no over-functionalization.",
Todoist is very intuitive and resourceful! I'm really enjoying my experience with this app!,
Very functional and well designed. Actually aids in getting tasks done.,
Firdt of all thanks a lot for the app! Would be great to have an ability to create subtasks for todays tasks.,
i hate the checkbox so much... Please make an option to remove them. Totally ruined the old nice swiping experience.,
Widget does not sync to app. The app was listed as not-optimized as well.,
I wanted to try this as an alternative to Any.do or Microsoft ToDo but it's a joke if a basic function like a reminder is a paid feature.,
"Hands downs, without a doubt, the unequivically best task management app available; full stop.",
"This app is a surrogate for my memory. I'm using the free version, and it's been extremely useful so far.",
"Please make your widgets follow System Dark Theme. UPDATE: Close they have ""Dark Dynamic Color"" but it still doesn't change depending if the device theme changes to light or dark automatically.",
"In use for over 2 years, it has all functionality needed for slef organization. Thank you.",
Latest update has made the app practically unusable. Constantly crashes when actioning any item.,
Great experience. I will have love that there will be an added feature to have notes against task created or completed.,
"Users are choosing privacy more, so should this amazing app. It's got Facebook trackers embedded & no focus on privacy. It should be implemented.",
Super useful. Templates for recurring projects are an awesome feature.,
I would probably call to do as the second best task application there's definitely a lot of room for improvement.,
It has no option for offline mode without account. You have make account and things to get started.,
"A pretty easy way to keep track of tasks and set reminders, whether recurring or not",
Ease of use is fantastic. Helps add some organization to my schedule without much effort.,
This app options is more than other similar ones specially priority but there is a problem that would better if you add timer or focuos mood,
"Exceptional, really helps track objectives and goals in a clear way.",
"good application, the free version is very limited since most of the functionality is in the payed version.",
"If you are a free user this app not suitable for you, because the most important thing ""task reminder"" option only for premium user which not available for free user. Most to do app give this option for free user 🙄🙄🙄",
Great App so far! I only have a question: Is it possible that the completet tasks don't disappear when checked?,
"Best to-do app ever. Easy to use, easy to organise. It clearly made me more productive.",
Keeps me structured and organized. Premium is definitely a game changer.,
"Still figuring it out and getting in the habit of organizing myself, but I love how I can break down projects or task",
Solid to-do-list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7-days ahead. The best app in my opinion,
"Great app, seamlessly syncs with the PC app as well. Very well polished.",
it is still killing my time.,
"Custom Filters, Labels, Comments and attachments ARE THE PREMIUM FEATURES with around ₹3100 per year... I wasted my time by downloading it.",
This is an idiotic app. First asks fkr all details including email. And then sends lot of junk mail. Uninstalling it. Nothing special about it.,
It's the best GTD based time management app out there. And it works fine across all platforms.,
So easy to keep a list of everything from work and home together and section them out. I love it!,
I'm new and still learning. It's a great app for planning your daily schedule. enjoying it so far.,
The to-do board is an absolute must for productivity gains. Loved the UI 😻 amazing job from the Todoist team 💪,
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.,
"One of the most overrated to-do apps. When I point out the issues, I receive cold response.",
"I can no longer get reminders with the free version, which makes this useless to me. Currently looking for a new app to use...",
"Awesome app! Smart natural language syntax support for task management, cool UX and multi-device sync.",
"Still getting used to it. I prefer typing tasks in on my laptop, but really like that I can see them on my phone when I'm out.",
"This would be a fabulous app if you could set tasks to reoccur weekly, monthly, yearly. Ugh!",
Love it! Allows me to write things down as they come to me then prioritize and schedule accordingly.,
It was a really good app you may add reminders and if you didn't it from time to another push a notification for you,
Great way for me to manage a time sensitive workload for multiple design client's and keep my home life organised at the same time.,
"Its the most amazing app i have ever come across , helps with managing and organizing tasks , its awesome , ddefenotely recommend it ,,,",
I've used several and this is the best I've used. Clean interface and every feature I want.,
Simply the best planner. Love it to the core. I have introduced your app to over 2000 students we train across various mba colleges in India,
Desktop version is great! Mobile version is almost as good and I use both. would recommend,
"Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects)",
This app is completely amazing. Many colleagues in my workplace use it. The pro version is worth it.,
Ok. Not as easy to add a project after task has been entered. A little clunky moving task to next day.,
really like the app a lot. the projects make it great to organize a bunch of disparate things,
Most features gated behind premium. UI difficult to use for setting recurring tasks for a future date.,
Amazing app. Such a simple yet brilliant idea. I've already seen a huge improvement in my productivity.,
"I like this app, but maybe you can add some schedule like note, not just to do list",
It does not have a language change feature But it is good in other respects,
"Oh God, I was searching for this for so long, and I mistakenly though any.do was it, and I remembering it just not being correct. Here's to hoping, this is just as good as it used to be! :D",
This is a great to do list app. And it sends reminders so you don't forget your tasks!,
It has been very helpful in getting to set and achieve the various tasks and reminders I have!,
"It is really an awesome way to clear your mind and to make sure you never forget anything, big of small.",
it's an awesome app I just wish that it would work better with Google. The system for creating new tasks using ok Google could be a lot better.,
"I first used to use this extension on my laptop, but I found this app, and I was delighted!they both are very nice.",
works very well. would like to see an option to make more than one list and choose which one to display,
"Love it. It's simple, but just the thing I need to keep my to-do list written down and handy for easy access.",
"eventhough i am disable and terminal, todoist allows me to be productive. I can not tell you what a wonderful gift that has been to me. It pushes me to live life to the fullest! I praise God for this program ... there is life after a career. Thank you!",
Helps me keep on top of everything I need to do. I especially like being able to organize my lists and even color code them.,
"Great application, use it from mobile, home and office desktops. Also sharing from Microsoft Teams is very useful",
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue.",
"Loads of features, everything you'd need in a todo app, very critical part of my life and managing my day to day chores as a brain injury survivor.",
"its just good. stick to it and you will see results, and see how much more time you really do have!",
Can't even use labels for free - it's a premium feature! Uninstalling on principle.,
Very basic. No reminders in free version. Useful UI though.,
"love the simplcity and intuitive-ness of this app, the layout makes it easy to use and helps me stay organised",
The best app ever !,
This app is such high quality in its usage and visual design. It's on par with the quality you'd expect from Google.,
one of the best ToDo/Task list apps i have ever used. it seems to do it all! BUT TOO EXPENSIVE,
"Long time user. Works well for my use case, which is mostly basic to-do-list, but also GTD method.",
"an amazing app, helps me keep myself organized while I'm under severe pressure from university and work load.",
Is a great app to help you keep track of your schedule and also help assist with breaking down tasks on projects 😁,
This is really good how it links into Google calendar.. keeps me on track with random day to day jobs id otherwise forget or be late with.,
it has a user-friendly and super easy interface. kudos!!,
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists,
"excellent. free app that syncs lisys across browser and phone, works oretty seamlessly.",
"Easy to use, great repetition features, helps me keep my tasks in sync between my desktop and mobile",
"Has every feature I need, basically the ultimate todo app! I loved the syncronization with Gmail and Google Callander.",
"obsessed with this app - with the integration with google calendar, keeps my entire life on track. 10/10 would recommend",
Love having Google assistant integration (through IFFT) and being able to share lists. My two deal breakers!,
"Superb to-do list that is so much more as well: project manager, business planner etc. Highly recommended.",
Use it every day to organize my life. It is easy to use and synchs with my Google calendar.,
Splendid app that I believe has the perfect mix between utility and simplicity.,
Great transition from our beloved Wunderlist. All tasks imported and now enjoying additional features offered by Todoist.,
"This app has changed how I manage my life. I am less stressed out because I can keep track of everything in one place, and I can feel at peace at the end of the day.",
I'm only a week 1 but so far it's been very easy to operate to go in to make changes. I can't wait to figure out how to use it to its fullest!!,
I never got further than the first screen because I don't see why I need to login with an account to simply make lists.,
"Excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment, reminder etc are locked on free edition",
This app is great but can you please add a Black amoled theme,
Does everything I need it to do. I like the natural language code you can use to set up repeating tasks.,
Sync across devices easily and quickly. Easy to create lists and love the layout,
awesome!!!!! i use this app everyday. it keeps me organized and i get so much done. I love checking off things on my list!,
Simple & easy to use. Task capture is excellent. Super easy.,
Great app. Can you please add transparent widget show that it will cover my full screen and look good with my wallpaper?,
"Best todo app i've ever used, and has helped me with alot of personal and professional work.",
Really enjoy the simplicity of this tool. Great for organizing my thoughts and actions.,
Excellent. Is so helpful helping me out with the reminders and I love how I can schedule things for future days as well,
"No easy way to import or export tasks in a non-proprietary, other app (e.g. Google Tasks) compatible format.",
"Can change the layout for Android tablets, it would be much better than now it is. It's good and I like it",
"There is tricky way to crash the app: delete task from widget, tap ""recents apps"" button, open an app (infinite loader is here), tap on three dots menu.",
"First heard from Tim Challies in ""Do More Better."" Very helpful productivity app. Use with browser on laptop too!",
"Good alternative to clickup, notion etc as far as personal productivity hours. Good for eisenhower matrix lovers.",
This app is so easy to use. I enjoy finishing my tasks a lot more. Really boost my productivity,
I think if there was a bit more flexibility wi5h how you can combine multiple deadline dates then it'd be 5 stars.,
"Handy tool I use daily. No ad junk interferences, simple, clean. I recomend for ppl who like simple.",
"This app is ok, but it really needs start date functionality. Their reasoning behind not adding it is terrible.",
"I think it's a bit silly that reminders & labels are premium features, but other than that: great app!",
it helped me to stick to my newly formed habits and organize my daily routines. thank you!,
Fixed the crashes - works perfectly now. Can't remove my earlier review for some reason.,
Reminders locked behind pro version so this app is useless to me. I will not pay for features I haven't had a chance to test.,
"The best time management app 3 years using it and it keeps me organised,efficient and productive.",
"good 👍, meets my expectations",
"this app is good, but I would like it if you guys could add like shopping list to it, and not just to do list. :)",
"The unpaid version is still useful enough to be beneficial, and has been a great help in managing my tafe assignments",
"I absolutely love the GUI and widgets, keeps everything organized and in my face. Exactly what I need",
I use Premium option for 2 years and I really like it. Simple but nice application.,
"Pretty much perfect. Love the natural language pickup mostly, feels great to use.",
Not as advertised,
"Requires a login to function, making it pretty clear what they're in business for. I'd rather pay for the app.",
It is good but mobile app doesn't have many options and many features are not accessible to free users.,
"I am really enjoying this app...only complaint is I am not sure how to make a list, within a single task, but that may just be lack of knowledge on my part",
this app saves time and is convenient to all students or workers. I absolutely love it!,
"Two word - Paid mess. Please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice , just go for a better app.",
"It's so easy to work with todoist as a planner , but I just have a tiny problem. Where can I see my completed tasks? Is there an option to make them visible?",
Perfect balance of useful features and a minimalist interface.,
I've been using Todoist for years. It's lightweight and does everything intended well in a simple way.,
Love this app. Use it with the chrome extension on your laptop to quickly task email follow ups and project goals.,
Love all the ways to categorize my tasks. Also great that it integrates with my Google calendar.,
"I wish there was a way to check the things you've already done in a day, but it's still a great app for what it is. It's a to-do list and it feels good when you check off an item.",
Very useful app for managing school work and long term projects. Highly reccomend!,
Top notch. Simple and effective. Wish it integrated with Google Assistant.,
"The monthly payments make the application a bit expensive, but the functionality is great",
"You cannot sort list in alphabetical order! That's a very basic feature, seriously?",
"I really like how they register tags like 'Something to be done everyday', it will take everyday tag and will actually remind you everyday.",
Easy to use across all devices. Helps me keep track of my dozens and dozens of due dates a month.,
Really helps me keep organized and on-time. This software has become my everyday tool.,
So far so good. I've not used any other function besides listing the activities and scheduling.,
Limiting sections is ridiculous .... so if you want to add things for 30 days you need to have seperate projects.,
Monthly sub for a reminder feature is laughable. App is totally basic with no features your basic note taking app doesn't have,
LOVE their open API which lets me automate and add my own features. It has completely chsnged how i organize my life.,
"After the latest update widget stopped working. It's blank (have no tasks) all the time, no matter what I pick. Latest version + zenfone 5",
Thank you for this great app! Is it possible to force RTL layout in the list items that appears in the widget?,
An excellent online to do list that updates on various platforms. Very pleased with it.,
Awesome! Finally found what I was looking for and it's straight forward. No typical bait and switch,
Very useful task manager. It's really intuitive and simple to use.,
"the UX for selecting date/time is terrible! otherwise, this is the best tasks app.",
"Stupid app. After you created list of tasks, it will be removed then they will ask to restore if you buy the premium license. Fraud!",
"It really is useful I love the interface itself, really is straightforward and aesthetically pleasing",
It is a good way to keep track of what needs to be done. I like the features that allow me to prioritize tasks or color-code projects.,
"Simple, modern, easy to learn application. My productivity soared with todoist.",
Great app that helps me organize and track the many projects and tasks I have to manage and complete on a daily basis,
"Looks great but no option to save to SD card, and I need phone space, so have to uninstall.",
Free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done.,
"Overly complicate, have to pay if you actually want to get reminders. Waste of my time!",
I love this app. It syncs to google calendar and helps keep me on track with tasks.,
"It keeps my life organized, and gives me a sense of accomplishment know if to do items.",
"Great app, easy to use. Would love to see the addition of Defer/Start dates like OmniFocus has.",
Great tool. Enough functionality to adapt it to how you want to manage your day to day.,
love the app. but could you give the option to toggle whether you want tasks of sub projects to be displayed or not?,
Its perfect for student's like me who take every day as challenge and tend to forget what's important each day.,
Great app for getting things off of your mind in order to stop having to constantly remind yourself of what you have to do and when you have to do it.,
"Honestly, the price point for premium is a no brainer. Combined with free toggl account is just about anything you'd need",
"Really like this app, even if you chose to stay with the free version it's a hell of a useful app.",
Amazing amazing app. The UI is so convenient. I maximised my productivity in a month with this app.,
Its a really great app to keep track of your activities especially if you have trouble with staying organised,
To-Do List is much better now and wish it would and will help me on my Schedules and reminders. Thank you Todoist.,
cant change my email it just gives me an error message,
"Helps me get more things done, very useful since I have ADHD, which can REALLY get in the way of being productive",
Finally found an easy to use to do list app with all the functionalities it needs. Very satisfied with this,
Uninstalled for only 1 reason. It syncs only alexa to-do list and alexa shopping list. Does not sync custom lists created on alexa.,
I liked the markdown support. Links editing in WYSIWYG mode is a total disaster.,
Life saver! This app has been a great help in increasing my productivity. Well organized and easy to use.,
Very useful app in managing tasks and getting them completed in timely manner on regular basis.👍,
"Best to-do app I've ever used. So simple, yet so effective. And the dark theme is just something I cannot live without.",
I am trying to login from my mobile device but unable to login through my email it's only working with Google Apple and Facebook. Look into this matter please.,
Fantastic app to set up repeating tasks. I love the interface across phones and it's web site,
"Its practical, intuitive, well designed. They obviously have good product managers",
This is my preferred app for managing my priorities and obligations. This app is simple and has a very clean user-interface,
It helps me keep up with daily chores. Having the reminder emails is a plus.,
Please don't install the app. Their use and keep your email to send spam if you already unistalled their app long ago.,
Made life simple....awesome app. Does exactly what I needed. Simplified my day to day appointments.,
"Super cool App that allows you to plan different activities with couple, family and friends!",
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding?? I've never deleted an app so fast,
Great task list app. Would love more customization options with the theme colors and font/UI choices.,
"Straightforward goal-setting, considering upgrading to premium because I like it so much.",
Very efficient way of organising notes and keeping track of what tasks have been accomplished.,
Not too complicated like clickup. The basic functions are enough for me to stay productively..,
I really enjoy the simplicity of this app! The sub-task feature is very helpful.,
This app is very useful. It divides your whole day into multiple tasks to make the day achievable.,
I have found this app to help keep me on track throughout my workday and reminds me to do things for home as well.,
By far the absolute best to-do app! The free version is great and the paid version is even greater!,
"Easy to use, intuitive, simple interface, effective.",
sync is a nightmare. email support just going in circles. basically a broken service.,
"Quick to add and complete tasks, effective reminders, good integration with Gmail.",
"This is a really good app, always helps me stay organized. I 100% recommend this app, you will love it,",
This app and platform works wonderfully. The user interface is friendly and easy to navigate.,
I love it! I'm so forgetful. I love being able to put in quick reminders and done!,
"Very useful! I'm in my second year and I use it more and more, for personal and business to do lists!",
"Amazing app. I use it all the time to keep track of my daily, and weekly tasks",
"Pretty cool app, simple, does what's intended to. Wish I could plan longer more easily though.",
I very appreciate that this Todoist app can really assist me to make important things done! Thank you! Let us have a wonderful summer!,
Use to be my favourite app but I can't recommend because they don't send you a notification when a task is due :(,
"I've been using it for several years. I wouldn't change it with anything else. Very stable, fast and easy to use.",
This app was great until recent update. It now crashes regularly and has become unusable.,
"Tried a few different personal productivity apps, this is the first which feels like it will stick.",
My favourite to-do app of them all! This one isn't complicated at all to use so it makes me want to use it more!,
Keeps me on track with all of my many projects and the minute details of things I work on. =] I really have a lot of projects!,
First task mgmt app that I have used almost daily for 3 weeks so far. Very easy to use.,
Loving it! And I can share different projects with different people. Pretty awesome!,
No integration with Google assistant. Will probably leave for more integration of hands free control.,
"Very effective app, works across platforms, simplify your life, outsource your short term memory",
"Everything is good but there is a minor bug while using the widget, i hope you guys will figure it out soooooon...😀",
"When the virtues that set it apart are premium-only features, there's no incentive to stick with this app.",
Please solve bugs. On android I cant see any projects. Something went wrong after the user interface changed:(,
Very helpful for reminding me that I haven't done certain tasks and keeping me doing things I otherwise might procrastinate over.,
"Absolutely beautiful app. I couldn't do without it. Well done guys. And the best thing is, it is always being improved and updated. Love it. Cheers",
"Really intuitive and clean interface, much better than Microsoft To-do",
"I started a new job as head of the department, and had no organizing skills. This app has changed my life.",
LOVE this app! It helps me aave paper and I still get the satisfaction of checking my to do list boxes!,
One of the best to-do list apps i have used.,
"Best to do list and project management in the market, and the paid version really worth it!",
I don't use most of the app features but the widget is really nice for quick notes and reminders,
Finally a to do that really makes life better. Accessible from everywhere with great UI,
"Great app, I use it daily and find it very useful. I have tried many ToDo apps and keep coming back to Todoist.",
"amazing app tbh, love that it's available on both pc and mobile. features are extraordinary and easy to use",
I have legitimately been more productive since using this app. Very appealing design and solid user experience. 👍,
so far so good. upgrading makes it easy to use additional organizational tools.,
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634,
Really easy and great that it links to my pc. Just what I needed to try and get organised!,
It's flexible when I'm on a creative streak & easy when getting out of bed is a task.,
I had a real improvement in my workflow some I've started using Todoist. It became an essential part of my daily organization.,
Getting works done thanks to this app! scheduling tasks both individual & project groups is super easy 👏 PS this apps Ui is better on iOS than om Android,
After recent update Todoist widget does not show tasks texts. It only shows dates.,
What I was missing in all the other to do list apps. I signed up for a membership after two days!,
"Subtasks & task-specific comments - wonderful! I haven't fully vetted it, but so far I love it!",
This app helps me a lot to organize my life. The new template feature is amazing.,
"I am student and so many things to learn and complete the task but some time not remember, I am use this app todolist.",
"simple, clean interface, awesome for sharing tasks with others on collaborative projects",
Perfect - does everything I know to want and I keep finding features I didn't know I wanted until I saw them.,
I really like the widget feature with that so I can put the to-do list on the first thing on my phone it's really nice,
Great app supports cross platform and overall great experience and and one more thing it would be nice to have shared labels,
The widget does not function with respect to updation and also no function works properly on the widget.,
"Great to-do app, I truly adore the whole ui/ux. Super smooth, intuitive and extremely useful",
"Switched after using Google Keep for years, and it changed my life! I'm laser-focused and productive now :-D",
It does pre-loaded tasks that can't be removed and it's not free if you want ut to set a reminder you have to pay for pro,
"Exactly what I was looking for, simple, intuitive, unobtrusive todolist",
It's wonderful for keeping track. Even the free version contains so much!,
"App crashes constantly after latest (Feb 8 2023) update. Was an excellent app before, please fix!",
todoist has made me feel more productive than ever before. have been using todoist as a college student now for a year and I love it!,
"great overall, some annoying bugs in the automated but over-zealous scheduling algorithm",
Some premium features should be free ! Otherwise good tool to manage one's projects.,
Great app to help keep me organized. It's become a regular part of my day. Highly recommend!,
"it's the best to-do list app i have ever used, i used to use wunderlist, evernote, keep. but none of them is better than todoist",
Overall it's a great app I just wish I could link it with my Google calendar or that it worked better with Google assistant,
Just the thing for this ADHD adult. And the premium features are well worth the price.,
love it! use it as part of my t r o system. especially love how I can link tasks directly to open emails.,
The app was doing well but it doesn't let me order the tasks in the way I want.,
This is an excellent app with good integration with gmail and is an apt replacement for the native google tasks app.,
"free, syncs lists, intelligent... nothing more was needed. Love it!",
"first login and the app keeps stopping after not even a second, have unistalled and downloaded the app again still the same problem",
so simple so effective. add the widget click plus add a task. click complete from widget too. changed my life,
extremely annoying multiple Popups to get the full version when creating a quick (!) task,
"It's exceptionally good app, i can reach it from my pc, mac and phone at the same time!!!",
I love having a widget on my phone where I can keep track of important things. I use it to keep track of bills and their due dates.,
Great everyday tool.. Have been using it gor almost 2 years now and cannot imagine being without it.,
"A lot of features, have not explored them all. Thus far very helpful.",
Overly complicated. Overpriced. Paid for a month. Wasted money. Need a manual to use it.,
Go for Microsoft To-Do list. It offers everything for FREE and it has also has native windows app.,
Love it! Easy project organization and to do list option. The widget for Andriod is AMAZING!,
I wish I could keep the left panel menu open. I hate clicking a hamburger menu on the bottom to choose other folders,
Great App. Free version work well for organizing multiple responsibilities. love it!,
"Due to an unknown error, I couldn't sign up first, but now everything works fine :)",
good app for a to do list and daily reminders. easy to use and very trustworthy.,
Fabulous app for organising your life. You quite simply brain dump all your reminders in here to free yourself to focus on living,
Very good. Already helping me get things done. Easy and intuitive to use. Would reccomend.,
I love the ability to prioritize tasks and set reminders in the app so you'll remember to complete everything,

This is my 3rd time using Todoist Premium but don't like it's features. Switching to alternative.,
Time reminder available to to premium only ..??? Really !!! 🤬🤬🤬 pretty desperate to earn some bucks .,
Been using Todoist for over a year. Find it flexible and easy to use.,
"Excellent app , you can organicse your task easily , and a best thing about this app is that you can save the trees",
Nice if you're bad at remembering everything you have to do. Quick and convenient.,
Great app with a very good UI. It's definitely helped me improve my productivity.,
Keeps me focused!! But I don't want to purchase anything. I think it could all be free in my opinion.,
Very functiona! I'm loving it! :) Would have been better if there's a Calendar view :),
"My life is manageable now, and I do not forget things (well I do, but Todoist is there to remind me exactly when I need to be reminded).",
Great to do app. Got me organized and productive at home during pandemic. Worth the subscription,
It definitely helps you be more productive and the interface is pretty easy to pick up on.,
So far so good! Supports kanban and it's completely simple to add and sort tasks.,
"I have been using this app forrr years, when ever I stop using it on a dialy basis, my producetivity and focus falls apart.",
"Its meh. Has a very boring, basic look.",
Todoist is super helpful for organizing tasks! So glad it was recommended to me. Thanks!,
Todoist can do a range of things from simple to complex depending on your wants and needs,
"The app is crippled unless you subscribe to premium, the price of which is much too high.",
I was super happy to download this app but that I soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your to-do list,
"This app has been perfect for me. It's really easy to use, fast and has just the right amount of features for me.",
"Love the app, it is so easy to use and set up my school work and other projects I'm working on in order to have a good work flow!",
It's a great app just not for me because I don't do things till the last minute. I believe there's room for improvement with the email service.,
I love this app. It improved my productivity and accountability tenfold. Don't read any more reviews. Just download it already.,
"simple, powerful task app. works with gmail great. keeps all tasks in one place.",
Great app to keep me up. Pls add more priority colour badges. Atleast 1 or 2 more. We need it. Pls,

"Very useful, lots of options while staying simple to use. I use it all the time",
"It is really good experience and to get organised using todoist is simpler, make me feel more energetic",
"It helps a lot, especially with consistently doing things that I want to do daily or weekly.",
superb for self management. Literally all my reminders are on the platform and it is one of the best,
I've been using it for a week and just enjoying how easier it became for me to stay productive through a whole day,
Excellent service.....making my day easier.... Really enjoying the service...... with in days the app become part of my life....,
Great app! I only wish the notifications would display as a push notification.,
It is great to get my to do list out of my head and onto a system where I don't have to carry notepads wherever I go.,
"It is a great app. Only been using a short time, so still learning. Will report back.",
"I've been using Todoist for a few months. I love it, super useful and robust.",
"Probably my favorite Android app. Incredibly well designed, functional, and fun to use!",
Can't print a list on Android. App is worthless to me. Get on the ball guys so it prints.,
"Actually the app is good, but the main part i.e Reminders is paid. Really unhappy about this. Reminder should not be paid.",
I manage multiple clients task list as well as my personal tasks. Easy to use.,
"this app helps me remind everything, and I've been more regular with my schedule, thank you todist!!!",
Very helpful and easy to use. It's helping me to not feel completely overwhelmed with all the chaos in my life,
"Only downloaded it for the reminder part which is a premium feature, lol. Never mind, I guess.",
great little app for keeping on top of things throughout the day and making lists.,
I love this app. No bugs or issues. It's done a lot to help me organize my work and personal to-do's.,
"It was ok, but lately its been annoying me with stupid, senseless push messages. So uninstalling it.",
"Best app to manage your to do list, and its syncing feature b/w laptop & mobile is amazing...",
I find this app usfull and given time to properly utilies all features of the app I believe it would be more so.,
Love the app but please bring back the previous function of sliding across when a task is completed.,
Great app - been using it for a couple of years now and it really helps me keep on track of all thw tasks I need to do,
It's good. If they can integrate maps then the world finally gets its pipboy.,
Excellent UI. Final a todo app that I think I will use for the long haul.,
Buggy. When I add a new label it crashes. For the rest good functionality,
"So far, it's really helping me to become more productive and building new habits. Not disappointed!",
"Powerful tool for creating categories of ""to do"" tasks, and these are synced across my various devices.",
After just a few days it's helping me tame the organizational nightmare of moving while making a living and staying balanced.,
Works great for sharing across my team for basic tasks. Makes manging tasks for others a breeze.,
"good app, but they keep giving me popups to review them even after I already did so. very annoying!!!!",
Very nice app. Almost all needs to kip track of own activities are fulfilled. Thanks.,
"Great app, only the subscription fee is a bit steep for what's on offer.",
It since I have this I have this account but it's not anywhere on my phone and I want to delete this account my camp it tells me how to do it to go to my profile to delete it yet I don't have the app. This is terrible,
I love this app. Nice customization and flexible. The widgets are awesome as well 😀,
my personal and professional work is more organised. helps me stay focused and not forget anything,
"Didn't like it, way too awkward to use and didn't sync well with my mail app",
"reminders, an extremely basic & necessary feature, not being free is insane",
Often crashed with dark theme :( But web version is good.,
"I live by this app, never forget a single task but the alarms rarely go off on time.",
I really like how it walks me thru becoming productive and learning how to prioritize with the tutorial.,
"really helpful, enjoying having my work much more organised and less daunting! thank you todoist people, you guys are ok!",
The one change I'd make... I wish I could change push notifications to only show tasks from certain projects,
Free version is great! Syncs up 2 ways with Google calendar which was a must for me.,
"My life is definitely going smoother wuth this app.even the most basic functions are useful, lots more to explore",
the app is awesome and does exactly what its supoosed to. the only flaw is in the operator.,
"Great experience so far, I have been using it for almost 2 years and it helps me not miss a task !",
works good! nicely persistent in reminders yet unobtrusive to be able to continue to focus.,
"Stupid app,even a reminder which is pretty much basic is under premium useless.Don't waste time in exploring this.Just go to any other nice applications",
"Works really well: simple to use but if you want, there are a lot of features you can use!",
When I open app only black screen appears and after sometime it shows the app is not working Thank you for fast reply,
Best to do list app I have used. It has all the features I want and works the way I expect it to.,
"Very good, but I'd like to be able to set a specific time in the day to do a task. But I love that it's ad free.",
I prefer Todoist over all the other tasks apps. Being able to connect it to Google Home is important to me.,
Best I've ever tried! You can stay organized as simple as black and white. It gets me.,
I'm using it daily since 3 months. I enjoy using the premium version as it is very handy to use.,
"Looks like it would be a nice app, but basic functionality like setting a reminder is an in-app purchase",
No longer useful. Task reminders are made premium feature. Moved to TickTick.,
I use it every day! it's great for keeping track of everything I need to do. Organized and easy to use: I love Todoist.,
Not for me. I couldn't get the integration with Google calendar to work. I only need something simple.,
"It's great. Sucks that you have to pay before you can access most of the greatness, but it's great.",
"Todoist is a clean, easy-to-use application and the Android app complements the web app perfectly.",
Love this app. The best organisation tool I've ever used. Would like to see a calendar view,
I use this daily. Very user friendly. Good repeating and postponing features.,
"Awesome app!! Theres so much u can do, so many features...way more then just a ""To-Do List""!?!",
"Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks",
"Reminders only available on prime if you purchase it. Nice way to catch you, be careful.",
"love the interface, the aesthetic and the functionality. I endorse this app.",
"The reason for 1 star rating is , there is no notification feature . At least give a notification feature for free",
Todolist has helped me organise and manage my work list very efficiently. Highly recommended!,
"This is a great app, it has made my life so much easier. I have tried other apps but this one has to be the best one so far. If you are thinking about getting it you should.",
Greatest scheduling app I've ever seen used. That's why I paid for annual subscription.,
It's very easy to add tasks with its incredible Natural Language Processing.,
Super easy to install and use. Highly functional free version with integrations 👏🏾,
"Great productivity tools i use it with my linux desktop,please add feature pomodoro timer for tasks with statics it will be the best app.",
Honestly the best app I could ask for. Managing and completing tasks in a form of projects.,
"Easy to use, compatible with Wear Os. Use it as daily apps for tracking my task & really love it.",
So helpful for my productivity. really helps me stay on top of all my jobs and sort them into areas so I can juggle work (multiple jobs) and home and everything.,
"Awesome app with great features and user friendly interface, definitely recommend it 100%",
"Close to perfect, and I appreciate the integration with Microsoft Outlook.",
Very simple UI and great experience. Great work team todoist 👍.,
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?,
I don't understand why the changes I make in this app don't sync with Google Calendar. What am I missing?,
"Easy to organize with due dates, categories and sub-tasks.",
Very good task manager. Works on all popular platforms. Has good free plan.,
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.,
In order to get reminders (which is what a to do app is for) you have to pay for their premium subscription.,
"good but no reminders in free version, sole purpose of to do is getting reminded of the stuff we need to do.",
Brilliant app. Has given me greater focus and helped me reorganise all the jobs in my life. Great job 👏,
"Needlessly complicated and doesn't do reminders. If I remembered what I needed to do without reminders I wouldn't need a to-do list in the first place, would I?",
Who wants to pay $3 a month? The free version just tries to upsell you the premium version while you're trying to use it.,
Excellent to-do list application. I came from My Life Organized; I just need something simpler.,
"I really like this app! Wish it also had pomodoro timer like feature, have to use another app just for it.",
"Definitely worth the money for premium, it's built for organizational people (or disorganized people trying to get organized)",
One of the best investments in my life so far. This app really helps to offload things which need to be done from your head.,
"Not easy to set recurring dates or access calendar, interface looks good",
"great app, just wish for the ability to integrate with my calendar and send reminders",
Everything I need in a home and personal project management app. Not too complex but not too simple ❤️,
Clean interface. Excellent work flow. Intuitive.,
"Will be really helpful to mark a task as cancelled, for future rafferance, rather than deleting it or change the labal. Thank you!",
"What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!",
"It does everything that you can expect from an to-do list app, help me to be much more organized.",
"If we complete 1 task through widget, it close all other tasks already shows in widget. Irritating.",
Todoist helps keep me organized and productive. I highly recommend it for a to-do app.,
Microsoft To Do does almost all of this for free. It is pointless to pay such a hefty sum of money for these so-called premium features!!!,
Instantly uninstalling after finding that just adding a reminder is a premium feature.,
"Be a Do-ist!! Organized My life a lot. Even in free version, you can enjoy a huge utility.",
I tried a number of todo lists. This is by far my favorite. I keep it open on my computer and phone all day.,
I would use the app but it's a paid app and I'm not sure of its true value because I haven't used it. How is it better than keep or others that are (for lack of a better description) free.,
"$4 per *month* and no reminder functionality without it? You're joking, right? One star, uninstalled.",
"The widget doesn't work, I am not able to modify anything through widget",
"this really helped me get my work done, i can always trust it for a plan in a time crunch, when i need to just SPLURRRGEE my brain snot into something that could be productive",
"Great app, lots of useful features. Helps me to remember what I need to do throughout the day.",
Love it. Best way I have found to capture all aspects of life and keep my mind clear.,
I use it for over 2-3 years and really like it. Love the new boards too.,
This has been the most useful app I ever downloaded. Very easy to use too. I paid for the upgrade. Well worth it!,
Absolutely amazing. Really easy to work and the Karma points motivate me a lot.,
It is a smart click in mind...😍 😎☝️Now I am able to perform my tasks in an easy way.. very smoothly☺️☺️..! I love todoist...💞🥰,
Well designed app / desktop task list. It is very customizable.,
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc",
Everything I clicked on its for premium account. That means I cant use it smoothly for free!,
"App works smoothly. Though I'd like if ticking a task produced a ""ting"" sound.",
"The idea of the app is great, but many services are paid. The free version is more limited than I thought.",
Great easy to use list making app. Just wish you could print lists,
"I like the fact that I can make a list, some call 'em projects, multiple lists of whatever I need",
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked,
I like using this app. I would love to see a sync between devices in future.,
Sporadic. Doesn't show notifications anymore. Only when I open the app.,
Upgraded to pro and never looked back. Single most important app on all my devices now!,
Its cool but ive been using it for a week now but sometimes i forget to check my tasks in-app dont know if it will become habit eventually or if i nees a reminder for that as well,
It is well organized and perfect for quickly recording homework for school.,
"Neat, does what you expect, with handy reminders and useful organisation of projects.",
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.,
It does what I want it to. Plan and get tasks done. Not overly complicated by things that I don't need.,
Pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added. I dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me.,
"It's a really great all, except that you can't make it buzz when you need to do something unless you pay.",
Truely exceptional app for staying organized at work and at home. I'm a Todoist for life!,
Excellent app. But... According Exodus contains 5 trackers. Come on... 21 century. Privacy is matter. Only 3 star.,
It's been an amazing app so far especially since I'm starting college and helping me organize my monthly drills,
Very intuitive UI and nice for the project management!!! Recommend! ++,
Reminders shouldn't be a paid feature. Basically undoes everything the app does well.,
"the best app Ive ever used for this. love their chrome extension. simply fantastic, might buy premium",
"Easily one of the most important apps I have in my aresenal. It seems simple, but wow is it powerful.",
Easy to use but some features are not clear. Nice dark theme.,
Why can't I reset my password no matter how much I try? App interface is good but so lagged and buggy.,
Wow after the last update i lost everything. All my notes. Insane. On samsung galaxy s21+. I hate it.,
phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer,
"Really great app! It's been few months I've switched to this app, and I haven't looked back",
Extremely helpful app! the interface is great and quite intuitive!,
Great UI. After trying other task management tools this is one of the best so far,
Just what's needed at times reminders until tasks are completed. Good idea.,
This app does not have reminded option. If we want to use remainder we have to upgrade and asking money to subscribe. So it's useless app,
Todoist is user friendly and it is really working for me in the way i like to schedule my tasks.,
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!,
"I love this app, using it for a while now, and I would love to continue using it, but since the latest update it constantly crashes. I can't even open it. Not sure what to do with it now...",
Strikes a good balance between being both feature rich and elegantly simple.,
"Since I usually have my phone nearby, this app is the easiest way to capture my to do thought as it comes to me.",
Helps me stay on track. Has reminders for tasks which I find invaluable.,
I need more details about the advance of the projects also a difference between a complete task and the death line (thanks for answering),
Best reminder app on the market. Easy to enter dates and times.,
Best thing is we can track the tasks completed on a particular day. I used it as result scoreboard,
this was the best ever app I used. I was never used to be productive like this ever before.I am achieving my daily goals every day. I am becoming different human being every day. thank you,
Great app! Even free functionality covers almost all my requirements! Kudos to developers!,
"Very nice working space, but the display of things can be a bit nicer.",
"Great To-Do list app that handles reminders well, it is perfect for my needs.",
"I just loved it, it helps a lot and you can implement your own organization system or prove others",
"works fantastic. effective and easy, lots of productive features. 2 thumbs up",
The widget feature is great. Everything can be done through that.,
"Good App does what it says, sometimes the inline text recognition dosen't work like it's suppost to be.",
I've used todoist for years. From time to time I've tried other systems but I keep coming back.,
The best and easy to use. Great widget. Very helpful for planning days,
"using this app with GTD method has changed my life. I am now more productive, more focus and less busy. thank you",
"It still says Todoist has stopped working ,was looking forward to the app,I'm very much disappointed.",
"Excellent! Does what it says on the tin, is easy to use and is definitely helping me keep track of everything I need to do",
"Even the free version is very useful! Great app, pretty clear design.",
"brilliant, simple and totally changed the productivity of my day to day life. 100% recommemd this app",
Great app. Simple and clean without sacrificing functionality.,
My husband and I are using this to stay organized through a move to a different city. It has worked out great!,
"Amazing, couldn't do without it! I use it for my personal to do lists/notes.",
I have been using this forever. The best app to get stuff done. I use it for my personal and work life. Kudos to the Todoist team!!!,
The tools that reminds me my todo list. Love sharing with my partner as well.,
"like being able to access my lists in different places, and that I can have multiple projects. I feel I'm getting more done",
"Super great app, drastically improve my productivity until the reminder feature was moved to premium... ☹️",
All functionality comes with premium account only... Shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version,
"It works well, but please make it for free we can't enjoy the full app unless it's fully paid.",
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app,
Most simple and excellent solution for task and time management.,
Really love the app. As it keep me on time and improved my productivity too.,
"Love it, but definitely needs the ability to sign into multiple organizations.",
Difficult to add items and navigate,
Great Todo app that nearly and visually groups things .. found it incredibly useful and would recommend,
"the beat application which I use on a daily basis for more than 2 years. thank you todoist, team",
Great experience. Great Interface and excellent system of Notifications. Thanks,
"Easy to use, integrated well with other tools and very intuitive, great app",
Literally the best to-do app. SO WHY IS IT NOT CONNECTABLE WITH GOOGLE HOME? Singlehandedly ruins my use for it despite the fact it's simply better than every other list app out there.,
Without it I would be a lost and stressed professional... For me it's an investment for my mind's health,
"quick, easy to do list generator. easy to add, easy to reschedule.",
Great app. Too bad they're now nagging you in the app to rate and review them. Otherwise super useful.,
very complicated to use. can't make my own personal task by deleting the tasks already updated.,
"I love the app, help me to organize my whole life in a minimalistic way.",
It's been a while since I was this impressed by an app in such a short time. It's not even been a week! Amazing stuff guys!,
I really like this app but I wish it had the ability to set progress on each task.,
Everything I was looking for! Great way to track tasks and progress.,
Lol how dare you. Use Microsofts to do list instead everyone. This app charges you an insane amount for reminders. Greedy developers. Microsofts note application lets you do all you want including reminders and they do not ask you to fork them cash.,
I highly recommend this app if you have an ✨attention disorder✨ it is wildly useful if you can find a way you like to use it!!,
"I love this app. This app makes my life easier, but i miss reminder feature in free version",
"Great app, super easy to use and keeps me organized with my college workload.",
Game changer. Best app I've used. recommended to many and one of the few apps I have happily paid for.,
"Recently upgraded to the paid version, and found it's even more helpful.",
Nice widget. Syncs across platforms well. Easy to use online as well.,
"Even the free version is awesome, i use this app everyday and it really helps me keep organized",
"ToDoist is a good thing but...did they really need to add the ""Karma"" function? I don't think so. I know how the actual concept of karma works. Life itself will ""punish"" you if you don't do the things you say you want to accomplish. If you don't have the drive right now to do something, maybe figure out why. The concept of Karma in an app, giving you more productivity guilt isn't going to motivate you either way in this case. I speak from deep personal experience.",
Reorganize my whole calendars tasks and keep in one place. @todoist app rocks for teams work and play!,
"Clean UI, ease of use, every functionality you need. Best todo list app ever",
My push notifications doesn't work promptly. I change my phone and then also its doesn't work,
this is a great app. simple & intuitive. just how i like it for productivity apps. thanks @ dev 👍👍👍👍👍 also AD free which deserves more star!!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,
Fantastic task tracking app. I've been using it for years and it keeps getting better.,
Simple easy to use not only helps with to-do lists but tracking your limits/habits ^^,
The full version allows you to do this. On the free version once you have completed a task you cannot see what it was.,
Great task management app but keeps crashing after updating a task or two.,
To do list app with lots of functions and integrations. One of the best,
Very very good app.. Free version is enough for small to medium companies..,
"Reminders, the MOST important feature, aren't included in the free version.",
outstanding fit making a task list. have been using this over my bullet journal and so far so good.,
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.,
"not exactly great for work, but perfect for civil life. has windows mac droid iphone apps. bit too simple for my taste.",
great app ! super easy to get into. the swiping function is very satisfying!,
"Nice app, i would recommend to anyone who wants to organize there day and get more done.",
I have tried many different to do apps and I haven't found any other that fits my needs as well as Todoist. Good job!,
Awesome productivity app. Filtering and tagging in the premium version are especially useful,
"User friendly and although my needs for an app like this is basic, I am totally happy with it.",
Perfect to do app. Integrates with my Google home. Thanks so much for this smooth slick app.,
Love this app 😍 great switch. Such an easy app to use even with just the free features!,
"Useful features ask you to get premium version but when I try I get to this page, which is the app I already have installed. 1/5",
The app is great but atleast you could have added reminders in the free version.,
"So far, it's very useful for staying on top of my work tasks. I also appreciate the email reminders.",
"Good but I think this application can improve, for example i want to see total table with a calender",
"Very useful application, thanks! Could you please add tags grouping? Because I have created multiple different tags and now it is really mess!",
"awesome app to keep track of home, school, and work. I have it on my phone and my laptop and it's perfect.",
"Great app, with well thought out details. It has really helped me get a handle on all my tasks",
Free version is no use and I'm not paying for an app I can't try before I buy so I'm uninstalling. Sorry developers but not for me.,
More features now in the free layer. Basically all I need for a to-do app.,
Very simple and clean UI. So far would recommend to pretty much everyone,
Great product. Efficient and easy to use. Would recomment to anyone.,
"Great app! One of the best things about it is that you can run the app on Linux, iOS and Android, which works great for me.",
"Great app, I use it everyday!",
"Excellent application, I have been using it since 2013 with premium account.",
"Great app, it resolved half of my couple issues. I would definitely recommend it.",
Exceptional organization tool. Helps keep a bird's eye view of all open projects.,
It is goed better than I expected their windows app is bad but we all have a browser so that is not sometging bad.,
The first to-do list app that makes me wanna do stuff instead of making longer and longer lists,
Fantastic integration with Alexa. Any errant thought immediately makes it to my list.,
"Todoist is simple, customisable, and helpful app to get things done. Must have app for Productivity.",
Does exactly what I need it to do with an enjoyable ux/ui. Good integrations for my needs.,
"I liked this app because it has a computer version as well, however it's a shame you have to pay for reminders as that's what I need",
I love this app! It has made my life 100% more organized and helping me get things done.,
"Really great, but please add some more dark themes with different colors!",
This app is great for what it does. I just wish that reminders weren't a premium option.,
"Great app! Very easy to use, would highly reccomend. No ads or pop ups! :D",
"Very good app, smooth, organized, and functionality is amazing.",
"After extensive testing, the best one for me. I wonder if there is some easy way to create subtasks on mobile...",
Best to-do list app ever,
great app for tracking your progress and keeping on top of your tasks.,
Great app and it is way better than your regular reminder application. Gonna start using it for my daily life routine,
"Amazing, this is the app I've needed! Haven't even dived into all the features yet. 🙌🏻",

"great app. But, you have to purchase the premium to set a remainder for your task.",
"Updated review -- Todoist fixed the issues I had complained about, and is now a 5-star app for me. Thanks!",
Best tool I've found for staying organized and making progress on goals.,
"Dev's response resolved my query regarding auto-change of date from the use of keywords like ""yesterday"" or ""tomorrow"" in task Perfect to do list app",
This app is amazing! It's really helped me streamline my productivity! Definitely recommend.,
an excellent app for organising your life on the go...,
That's amazing.... I used this app in 2014 and today I just installed it again and it still remembers my tasks in 2014.,
I love the fact that it syncs between devices! Overall great app!,
Easy to use and reminds me via notifications and email. Keeps my life on track.,
Very clear interface and a nice priority system to section off the most important things.,
Starting to organize my work time better thanks to this app. Reminders are great!,
So useful! I love it! It's a load off my mind to have a recurring checklist!,
Why has the daily notification stopped outlining the tasks due for today and now instead is giving a useless supposedly motivational message?,
"The best to-do app, love it. Easily synchronizes across all my devices.",
puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly.,
"Best productivity app, clean interface. No paywall for removing ads.",
Amazing app that has helped me accomplish a ton of task and keep track of my life.,
"Some basic features that other app provide are paid features in this app. For example, reminder and labels",
Helpful for everyday to do lists. Easy to create different catagories.,
great time saving and organizing software. i use it every day.,
This app is too complicated for me. After 3 days I canceled it and could not get a refund. Cost me $36.,

Remainder app for free? That’s what I Thought this app was. Please don’t waste our time it is very disrespectful. For you to get people you say it’s for free the app and it’s not for free. Please don’t do that its not nice to delete apps because you say lies. Lies are not good and if you play with my trust and the world trust you are not helping the world to be a better place you are helping to continue destroy I don't want to open no more apps I don’t trust what they say,

"I recently tried out the Todoist app, and I have to say, it's a fantastic task management tool. This app makes organizing tasks a breeze. With its user-friendly interface and customizable features, it suits the needs of programmers and anyone looking to boost their productivity. Managing projects and deadlines has never been easier!",
I love this app so far. I mean the only thing missing is a monthly view.,
subscription based,
Good app,

Constant crashes after latest update,

"I am using Todoist since many years and I find it very useful for my productivity. One defect that it has is with rescheduling tasks: very often it returns to the original date in a few seconds and the operation has to be repeated. This is very annoying, it has never been solved in many years and it affects both the app and the website.",
Amazing App.,
Great,
Sharing a URL to task seems not to work anymore. Can someone have a look at this?,
Great experience!,
Great♥️,
Good,
"Update: looking for where to make sure I have my current card information so I don't miss a day in renewing and found my first review and nothing has changed at all. I occasionally have to look up how to put in the correct wording for the days, but otherwise I just depend on it to keep my ADHD list making straight first in my business and now that I've closed my business just in my everyday life. I love it! I've been using it for years and depend on it.",
Good app,
Lovely.,
ok,
The best,

"Since the latest update, the todoist widget which shows the list of to do items is refreshing constantly causing Google Play services to drain the battery. Both phone and tablet versions are affected. This means I cannot use the app in my customary way affecting my workflow.",
Simply amazing..,
great,
"For months, it constantly crashes when rescheduling multiple overdue tasks. I've let support know about this several times and nothing's changed! It's irritating.",
loving it!!,
good,
👍❤️,
Bugs glorious bugs. Crashing when adding projects. Tasks duplicate themselves for no reason. Tasks disappear when you try to add them. Your software has gone from brilliant to nightmare in the space of a couple of days.,
Melhor app do MUNDO para organização de tarefas,
Not an ai,
super app,
"I am running a device firewall that is telling me that it blocked 58 attempts by todoist to send device information to Google (including ip address, gps coordinates, my name, email, and a lot of info about my device itself). Why does the todoist app transmit so much device information to google that is unnecessary to using the app? I thought by being a paying customer this type of information selling was not necessary.",

App is constantly crashing and doesn't sync to web anymore. Believe it started shortly after Android update on February 7th.,
"The latest update is terrible!!! I had used this app for years, loved it and depended on it daily if not hourly, and now it constantly closes or WON'T OPEN ON MY PHONE!! I dread the thought of having to move everything to another app. PLEASE FIX ASAP!!! 🙏 🙏 🙏",

confusing,
Awesomer,
"Last night was daylight savings, so when I woke up the app asked me if I wanted to auto correct the time zone due to the hour difference, and now all tasks got moved up one day in the future. Very frustrating! Edit: overall, the app is excellent.",

Good way to coordinate a to do list across platforms.,

"Loving this app, a panacea for a serial procrastinator like me. One suggestion though, while selecting a parent for a task can we please have a search function included , instead of scrolling through all tasks ?",
"NOOOOO!!! NOT DISABILITY ACCESSIBLE!! Latest update moves controls to screen bottom, with no setting to revert back to top! I am clumsy and frequently lose grip strength, and you moved key buttons to a place too easily pressed accidentally or when aiming for phone controls; also too small and low-contrast. Dropped ⭐s from 5 to 2 because you made an indispensable app nearly unusable.",

"It is annoying that it shows the date of the plans wrong. For example it should show the day of an event today, but it shows tomorrow. Messed up if you do not double check. I cannot trust it if I don't check my real agenda. I don't have time for this",
Sweet,

"Tried it again. ""Reminders are only available with a Pro subscription."" Yeah, I don't think so. Someone is giving this developer some really bad advice. Software is not a service. I'm not paying a SUBSCRIPTION FEE for basic functionality that should be included in the base software. If you feel the need to make money from your app (and you should), then a ONE TIME fee of reasonable amount is fine. I'm not subscribing to something you can stop developing at any time while still billing me.",
"Didn't notice ive used this app before (memory problems) so I tried again... this time the app just kept crashing. Useless if I'm using it to help navigate ADHD because that crash will set me on a tangent and ruin the rest of the days productivity. That's not a dramatization, it's really that big of a deal. The app looks like it might be cool otherwise though so it's sad they seem to have messed up What's the point if reminders is a paid option... I'm not gonna test that feature by paying you.",
App maravilhoso. Excelente para organizar as tarefas diárias.,
"After updating, custom filter queries can no longer find tasks in #Inbox.",

just great,
All existing filters broken in latest release - filter text changed to °query°. Mysteriously fixed when app logged out then in again.,
I've been using this app for 7 years+. I decided to switch to Nirvana GTD. Todoist is constantly buggy. You guys are still fixing and making bugs for 7 years! Why don't you release a stable version for good? I'm sick of reporting bugs and playing the beta tester. Everytime I am in a real usage situation there is something wrong with todoist. You cannot count on it to be your main productivity tool. I'm out. And so are all the people I've recommended you through all these years. Bye.,
Good application,
"I absolutely LOVE Karma. I love seeing stats on how I'm doing with staying committed to my deadlines. It would be REALLY nice to see more details of the quality of the tasks that I'm completing though. Ex. How many were based on a certain tag or project? Otherwise, a pretty decent app.",

"I've been using Todoist for 5+ years now and absolutely love it. However I now feel that there are slight improvements that could be made in redering Todoist widget UI. Something which can show me a month calendar on top of a stack of my events(from gmail/Google Calendar), would be super convenient to get the snapshot of my week and daily tasks, all at once. I'm happy to provide some sample sketches/wireframes if required",
UPDATE: yes I do have it I just didn't see it before XD. ORIGINAL: An add button widget would be super handy (I don't have it on android).,
"Update: thanks for adding ability to sort by project, along with lots of other features! You've got a fully GTD-compatible tool.",

"Selecting multiple tasks to change priority, or change due date stopped working with latest update. Apologies if already reported. Thank you, Jim Ps: Swipe right to select vs. Press to select.",
Currently the best to do app for personal use and medium work projects.,

Excellent task app. Use daily on my android phone and Windows desktop. It would be even better with a microphone button on the widget for voice to text (like Business Calendar).,

I've now bought the premium pack as I needed the extras plus it's nice to support the development. I really can't do without this app now and it's great getting everything out of my head into it. 2021, still using it and couldn't do without it.",
"I have been an extremely heavy user of Todoist premium for some time. They went through a long rough spell with a lot of breaking changes. But I updated my review because it has been stable for some time. I'm glad to see such a powerful and useful tool be reliable as well! I'm hoping this was an intentional focus on quality, because if it was, it shows.",
"Update: good app with an out of date interface. With their latest update, the reminders have never worked for me on Android nor the other apps. The Android bottom bar is a bad look and makes this app look even more disjointed from their web app",
"editing for the 2nd time: the app is still the smoothest and arguably the best designed, but the lack of a calendar time blocking feature made me switch to ticktick, much more feature oriented. hope you add such one",

Using this for 4+ years now. Still waiting on my points below. Adding anither pain point:battery use in Android app. Its improved my productivity. Even the look feel and UI helps. Some obvious flaws remain. Hoping to move it to a 5 star when 1) it adds more settings for default tasks 2) dependent tasks. 3) sharing tasks by assigning without sharing full project,

I have used Todoist extensively for years. It's just a simple way to keep lists of tasks and subtasks grouped by project. Now they reduced the free plan to five projects. That pretty much undermines the utility of it for most of us. I really think I'm just going to move all my tasks to plain text files.,

I tried the free version and was not impressed due to many features hiding behind the pay wall. Then I decided to try the paid version. Todoist pro does everything and more than any other program I have ever used. I strongly suggest trying the paid version. The customization can give you whatever you need in a Todo app! I can email to a task list even from mobile email. The ability to reference one task in another is a great way to link things together.,
"I've used this app for years now, it's outstanding. Never have any problems, it just performs exactly as required with loads of helpful time saving features",
"The App is very good in everything (if pro purchased ) , there is no any similar App , But it is expensive you need to pay about $36 every year to get all features I""ll like it more if it is lifetime one time purchase",
Great productivity tool to manage personal tasks and work projects.,

"Edit-2023. Not sure why the devs decided to remove the ability to arrange the project list with a press and hold, then drag and replace it with a several step process of scrolling and pressing buttons, but I will not be using the app any more because of this. It's been this way for many months now. 2017 -Great app with premium subscription. There are some inconsistencies between app and web interfaces that are bogus but can be overcome with filters. I think filters are what make this app for me.",

The paid version is also 100% worth the small annual fee.",

"Does not integrate with outlook. Premium version require annual fee, with only cosmetic added tools. Can live with the free version but looking out for better app that syncs with outlook. now can sync with GTasks but require 'integration' app by 3rd party (pay thru the nose eg. $15/mth). would be good to have 2 way sync, for users to leverage on both apps (using premium subscription of Todoist)",

"Love the app, I've signed up to premium a year ago and I'm continuing my subscription. I'm using the getting things done (GTD) methodology with this app. A feature idea: allow users to choose when ""today"" ends or when ""tomorrow"" starts. E.g. my day doesn't really finish at midnight every day, I consider my day finished when I go to sleep, which sometimes can be at 3-4 am. So I would choose 6 am to be my ""tomorrow"" so those tasks don't mess up my to do list on nights when I work late.",
"Former version of the app: I tried several task manager services before settling on this one. Lots of good features without unnecessary frills. **** Update **** as of April, 2020... SO disappointed :( Unfortunately Todoist didn't know how to leave something alone that wasn't broken - and added unnecessary frills. The functionality has become too layered and cumbersome. What used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps. My time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks. After years of paying for the Premium and being one of their top users, I am in the market for a replacement. There has to be something that is more efficient out there.",
"I'm changing my review from 5 to 2. I'm a pro subscriber and love this app, but latest widget changes for Android are truly terrible. I can't click the todoist icon to get the app open anymore because that's gone, I can't click the reschedule shortcut button anymore because that's also gone, and I can't select multiple tasks to mark done at once via the widget anymore. But hey it's transparent now! Horrible update and I hope the team behind this update sees this review.",
"Update 04.2020 - this is getting worse and worse still, with every update. Now they made it harder to edit your task - they moved it behind two clicks. Why?? Seems like this app is moving away from the todo-app for power users to just another todo app, same as any other. This is the last time I paid for the premium subscription. Time to move. ----- It used to be the best for power users, but after the latest ""updates"", the app keeps getting worse and worse. I am not really sure who this updates are for, definitely doesn't seem like it's for its core user group.",
Enjoy Todoist Premium but an update to the widget has made the fonts smaller. As this is more difficult to see I don't think it's an improvement.,

This will meet many people's needs. Best multi-platform apps. Best location reminders. Easy to use. I would like start dates and others have requested them for years but Todoist refuses to add them. Down a star for that. The offer a work-around but it's not convenient.,
The Google Calendar integration is riddled with bugs and it has been this way for months. They don't fix it and they are pretty slow on their communication. TickTick is becoming very tempting.,
"Playstore info says in-app purchases. I'm on premium longtime. App widgets for Gmail & calendar. Filters, labels, shorthand for dates, recurring etc., so flexible: *discipline* required to set your own process! Helpful examples and tutorials on their website. I do outlines for book, project, trips, recipes. attach files. I prefer web app on my Chromebook, then this app on mobile. Beware: App is addictive. Wanted: print as outline, tasks, dated comments",

Can search completed tasks in Todoist if upgrade to Premium. Cannot search completed tasks on Wunderlist on Android or PC (although can on Apple iPhones & Macs). OneNote, Evernote, Google Keep, memit are too basic for my tasklist needs.",

Porem de um tempo para cá, mesmo com a configuraçao para manter no google calendar as tarefas ja executadas no todolist, o evento do google calendar some. Podem verificar?

Если все эти под задачи назначить на выполнение на определенную дату, то во вкладке Today, все задачи будут отображаться одним сплошным списком, без какого либо визуального разделения на задачи и под задачи.",

"The one app that's stuck with me all these years, from my senior year in uni to my first year as project manager. Fast, simple, intuitive, and beautiful. Stop managing your work on Excel or email. Get things done with Todoist. This app helped me build the habit to organize all parts of my life. All of it. Dare I say I wouldn't have felt as confident to move into a management were it not for this app. I value my time more deeply now vs. before — the only real reason to use a productivity app.",
"The problem with todoist is that it's so good. Initially, and every year at renewal, it appears expensive - more than competitors. £36/year at the moment. Office 365 costs around £40 in sales. So I try competitors - and my life gets slightly more stressful every single day. I sign back up to todoist, and there is relief and I feel organised, relaxed and on top of things. All in all, bite the bullet and go premium - it's the best in the market and worth much more than £3 / month.",
"Todoist is my one and only task-manager. Finally broke down and got the premium version and I am never going back! I love everything about this app, and its web version is also amazing.",

"I like the new design, but there's simply too many buttons to press to get anything done. One of the functions that I liked best from the old design was ""add another task"" so you could quickly add similar task in the same category without going back and forth. I'm a subscriber and will not renew unless navigation improves.",

"i will not change the score which I already put as 5 stars, because I trust the amount of effort you put in to bring Todoist to existence. But please consider returning back seeing sub-projects tasks when viewing parent project. Romoving it is not a good step, I believe this change was not studied well in advance; I cannot figure out why you remove a feature as useful as this one.",
Great app but lots of feature are paid like reminders and tags which can be found free in many competing apps. I wish developers make reminders available in free app.,
App crashes whenever I try to edit time of any task.,
Been using it for 3 years now. I rely on it completely,

Update: This is my go to app for my to do lists. I am a list person. Definitely give it a try! ------ This is currently my favorite to do list app on the market. It would be a solid 5 stars to me if I could select several items in my inbox and assign them to a specific project in one step. Please add this feature or let me know how to do it if it already exists and I missed it somehow. Thanks,
The app is now working very well on Windows 10. It is a good app and worth the upgrade for the annual fee. Recommend it.,
"New update is incredibly finicky and makes it difficult to add existing items to projects, change dates, etc. Appending a task with #project_name no longer adds it to the project, it just takes it as a string literal.",
"I have the basic Todoist. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5-star 
rating is that it's more complex to set a repeating task than it was with 
my old electronic PDA.",
"Great app, beautiful UI. I wish the ability to comment on tasks was free, though.",

"Very long time user. Latest updates are making things harder. Subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again. Example: I have a weekly todo titled ""Groceries"" with grocery items I need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task. Whereas before I could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when I go shopping again, it's now completely gone.",
"I personally have quite enjoyed the new update. The new task edit view makes much more sense than the old one (which looked like the default material calendar entry view). I haven't experienced most of the issues others have talked about: adding tasks quickly to Inbox is faster than ever, labels are not truncated and are much easier to assign and subtasks are now much more intuitive. Although reassigning projects is definitely cumbersome, overall it's a step in the right direction for me.",
"Yes, this is a good app compared to what they had last year. I recently came back and found new features. The paid version has a lot more features than the free version. I am thinking about paying for the paid version. 11/24/2019, I am back for good until something else comes along. I was using Notion but can be overwhelming.",
The new update makes this already great app absolutely superb. I use their premium subscription and it's worth every penny!,
"Todoist is awesome. It works for new users as well as power users and offers an easily available and convenient API for software engineers or tinkerers in general. I highly suggest getting premium for the reminders and custom filters, and look around their website for neat hidden features in the program.",
"Great app, tried others but came back to todoist.",

"Overall the app is very flexible and supports all the task management features I was looking for (including sub-tasks, cross platform and even Microsoft Outlook integration). I look forward to better filtering and Material design coming. My only small gripe really is sometimes when entering a reminder time I find that Todoist doesn't recognize some of the ways I type it: eg Saturday May 23. I will have to ensure I put a comma after the Saturday or leave the day of the week off all together.",

(Sep 2013) took almost 1 year for decent reminders. Is still annoying to click twice to view the notes. Not very productive! (Oct 2019) with new interface the notes disappeared. The interface is just a copy of Wunderlist or TickTick. What is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality (reminders and notes) for nothing?,
Simply the best todo app out there. After the last update the flow is much better everything is more reachable and super fluid. Awesome job!,

The best todo app available! The new update has created the best user experience for todoist. Super easy to adjust tasks and add subtasks right to the task it's associated with. Previously I said the app was difficult to navigate until you learned the ins and outs but now this app is a must. It works as you think it should. Tap on an app and it opens up to a whole new level of adjustments and possibilities.,
"The UI is great, works and syncs on all platforms and Android wear. I wish it had better integration in calendar services but what it does offer is great Only missing feature for me right now is automatic dark theme, triggered by the system wide dark mode.",
"Looking good Todo manager. The premium was already expensive for India, but I just realized that not only they increased the price, but the price Indians pay would be more than the US price. Now, that's called a rip off.",
Was an avid Astrid user until Yahoo bought it and it went away. Moved to Todoist and regret I didn't do that earlier. Really worth looking into If you are looking for a good to do system with not only a good app but also a good website.,
Been a subscriber to this product for many years now and it keeps going from strength to strength. Loving the new foundation version !!,
Love new update! Didn't think it could get any better...then it did 😀,
New layout and functionality is no bueno. Don't like the interface for rescheduling tasks. Please fix!!!,
"Things to do: - Add a ""Move task"" icon to the single selection toolbar (it's currently in the ""..."" menu, annoying) - Use the de facto Android standard for multiple selection: the LONG PRESS, gosh! Other than that, 3 stars for the occasional bugs. Tasks are often slow to move, as in I move a task then after 2s it goes back then moves again, making it a mess. Tasks got sometimes lost in other subtasks because the drag and drop gesture is clumsy.",
Great app.,

"I've been using this app for several years, and I am a premium subscriber. There are many fundamental thing this app does correctly (inspired by David Allen). However, there are some functional things that are annoying like trying to add a subtask from a filter view (e.g., ""Today""). Support just says it's not an issue and then says they'll ""make a note"" when you push them on it. The fact that there is a feature disparity between iOS/Android is insulting as I am paying to use on Android.",
Absolutely love this app. It keeps my life from spinning out of control.,

"UPDATE 2: Screw it. I'm giving you the fifth star, solely because your update notes *actually* say what you're fixing/changing. UPDATE: 3 years later, and this is still my app of choice. I've tried most other task management apps that provide cross-platform syncing, but none of them works as well as Todoist. Despite this, I *still* think the annual pricing is a little expensive for the few pro features I use, but overall I'm very happy with this app.",

"Really working for me. Then I forgot about it for two years and now I'm disorganized again. But I'm back now and it's better than ever. My main thing is location based reminders. It's still a little clunky with this app, but every other app is much worse. I'd like to see an app that will let me save several locations, and quickly just tag a task with it. This doesn't quite do that, but close.",
"They recently added check boxes (circles?). It was a jarring transition, both visually and functionally. It made the app less visually appealing. Also chamging functionality of the app, without asking if thats what I wanted, almost made me uninstall it. Edit: several months after the check boxes were added ive found myself using them about 50/50 woth swiping. They're pretty great when you want to complete a bunch of tasks at once. Would still be nice to have a button to turn the checkboxes off.",
"Disappointing experience. I used Todoist from July 2016 until a few days ago. I supported the developer with a paid subscription even if I've hardly used its extra features. On the 3rd of August, during a routine update, all the keyboard shortcuts were broken. I logged an incident to make sure they were aware of the issue (#385170). Asked a couple of times an ETA for the resolution of the issue; instead, they used me as a beta tester. After 3 weeks, not only was the problem unresolved but they also didn't give me an ETA for its resolution. At this point in time, I have had enough so I decided to withdraw my support by cancelling my paid subscription. They cancelled my subscription but rejected my request of partial refund. It's about 3 months so ... less than 8 USD. I consider this very bad customer service ... but there is more: I'm still waiting for a reply after 10 days. You can make up your own mind.",
"Todoist is so flexible, powerful and available. I've used Todoist Premium for years. Although I keep an eye on the competition, they all fail to tick all the boxes this powerhouse does. That said, could it improve? I think so. Better interaction using voice would be good. And sometimes I wish start date existed and better metrics around duration of time. Maybe in future releases. Oh and more gamification aspects. Can I live without them? Of course, owing to the versatility the app already has.",
"Pop up notification (alarm with voice) is not available. Please do needful. Check to do reminder, it will help you to make your app improve.",
"Very useful app, especially when combined with the desktop/web version. I use the mobile one to add tasks and comments on the go, and to follow-up on them.",
"Highly user friendly, but the free version lacks some of the useful features...",

I installed Todoist again and it seems even more intuitive than the last time i installed it. Ot certainly isn't the tool that keeps me getting things done. I just have to use the tool. It has certainly helped me to finish a project I have been working on.,
"the paid version is worth it. Love that i can use the ""share"" function from many apps to transfer the info to Todoist",
Ability to switch accounts will be awesome. 5 starts once that's supported.,
i love getting things out of my head and into Todoist!,
Notifications are received only after app opening.,

"Awful UX/UI - I don't like how you have to use a rigid syntax to set recurrence for tasks. I like old fashioned controls, but Todoist is just trying to be different for no reason. Was on Premium for several months and gave it a fair shot - needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and switched to TickTick instead. I don't normally downvote apps, but this just didn't do it for me, and I spent money on it. I should have ignored the hype, so the fault is mine.",
"Fantastic tool. Keeps all my tasks beautifully organized. Bug free. Wish that it was easier to manage recurrance. Seems you can only manage recurrance using the text feature in the name, but if you want to change the date or time of an occurrence you lose the recurrance settings. I wish there were an option for manually setting up the recurrence settings.",
"Helps me go from list to a prioritized plan. It's really great. I use it with my team for work and with my husband in the rest of life. This app is basically my brain. I've been using it habitually for over a year and I absolutely love it! Before I found todoist I tried anydo, remember the milk and a bunch of other apps. This one is the best IMO. I used to use planner pads which is a paper calendar system that really helped me plan. This is the only app I've found that has similar functionality.",
"Been a paid member for years. They've been completely frozen in time, features people have begged for years have been ignored or if they do it takes them years to implement. Had to wait years just for dark mode. I saw a blog post on their site where the project manager boasts about travelling full time in his car with his family, explains a lot really.    They've really let their (once) loyal users down. Hopefully another app comes along and eats their lunch because it's there for the taking.",
"I used to like this app because it was like writing in a physical notebook, but that smooth user experience is gone. I feel like they are focusing too much on adding new stuff while the core functionality gets looked over.",
Simple and mininal. it's really useful and I use all day long on my personal life and with my task as freelance. the free version doesn't have ads and that's is something that I really appreciate 🥰,
"Works really good. I love having the same on all platforms. I use thge phone, and firefox plug-in on the computer. I alaways wonder about privacy of the ""cloud"" storage, but todoist works too well for that to be a hindrance.",
"Todoist works great for what I need it to do. You can sync across multiple devices and the internet, create recurring tasks, and make subtasks within larger projects. Really helpful to keep track of things.",
So far the greatest to-do list app I have found. It helps me organize my life and to not forget anything.,
The most versatile task manager there is. Fantastic support and customer service. Works at every level from simple lists to project control.,
Pretty easy to use. Have been looking for something to sinc my three devices with. This may be the tool that does that. Post script - I have used this app for five years and it works well. i highly recommend it.,
for years this has been my favourite app for implementing the GTD method. a calendar view would be a most welcome addition to the app but i am happy with the current features.,
Todoist is indispensable to me in organizing my life. They're responsive and do a great job consistently adding useful features.,
Not sure how I would structure my professional or personal life without this app👍👍👍,
Best organization app I have ever seen!!! I cannot imagine my life without it.,
todoist + nova launcher gestures is the fastest way to clear my head of things i need to do! love the app,

"Still the best on the go task list I think, the latest changes are more difficult to get the hang of. And it changes by itself from today to tomorrow when least expected. More documentation on using features would be nice. Again, I would like it if it didn't switch categories without notice. Like I'll be on today and next thing I know it switched to my Personal list of to-dos. It's very disconcerting.",

A separação por projetos me ajuda a separar tarefas pessoais, do trabalho e de estudo que antes ficavam misturadas em outras ferramentas que já utilizei. Gosto da simplicidade e objetividade desse aplicativo, entrega o que promete sem frescuras.",
"I've been using this app for probably over 4 years. I really like it. I dont have any real problems with it. For personal task management, whether they're one-offs or repeating tasks, it's fantastic. With the paid version, you get labels which help with organization a lot (it's a lot better than just putting things in projects). My one issue I have is that I dont understand why every task needs to be in a project at all. The majority of my tasks have labels and don't belong in a project :/",
The best tool in my entire personal and professional life! I am using it continuously since 2013 and I am still amazed by it every day. It has no rival. No matter how extensive I searched for and for how long I still could not find any other app to top it!,
"still my todo app of choice. offers organization power beyond any other, thanks to its multi level subtasks and projects. it's sad that the free version doesn't offer reminders, but the pro version is not expensive and this app is worth the support",
The new update ruins the task completion experience! Swiping right to complete tasks was much better than tapping a small circle.,

"This app and Todoist Web are nice products, but they do have their issues: 1. It's hard to know what to expect from Todoist in the future. Updates and fixes take a very long time, and there is no public roadmap or issue/request voting system. 2. Todoist promotes itself as great for the GTD method, but it lacks core concepts like Next Actions, Waiting For, and Reviews. 3. The app refuses to start if you don't like Google Services (GSF) on your phone.",
Switched to todoist after using many similar apps. Works well for me. What I like about this app is the seamless integration with Google Calendar.,
Love this app. I am happy to pay for premium. The recent update is good the onlu issue I have it the fact that each task now takes up too much space on the screen. Overall still a great app.,
"I have been using Todoist for years and it has never let me down. The app and Outlook plugin always sync like they should. I don't bother to use the paid version because its rather pricey, but the free version has a reasonable amount of features to use on its own.",
"I use Todoist on Windows and Android to sort most of my life, along with google calendar. It is a very slick, simple, and powerful piece of software, and I'm a extremely happy user of more than 4 years.",
"The update got rid of a major tool for me. You can no longer press and hold the task to bring up the option to delete it. Not even sure how you delete on mobile now, which is very inconvenient!",
"LOVE Todoist! I use it for to-dos and as a calendar. Use the comments for addresses, phone numbers and even grocery lists! It really keeps me on top of things.",
I love the fact that I can use it across platforms. I have the premium and I do not feel sorry for the subscription. I tried to find others that do the same job for the same price or cheaper but did not manage.,
"Of all the similar apps I've evaluated, this one is the best",
no more paper lists-its great,
Can you guys implement a sound upon completing a task? That'd trigger my dopamine production tremendously.,

Overall it is the best product I've found to organize and track projects. The last few years I have been trying to get them to incorporate dependant and independent task feature. Someone wrote a script (which doesn't work anymore) to do this. It is very handy since it will automatically add the next action on a project to your list of next actions without having to review that project to add that task to your next action list.,
"A very nice, highly functional to-do list. Lots of great features, including the rare ability to place tasks on more than one list (using labels). Still some limitations, especially the number of tasks per project and the ability to easily change the order of tasks. Also, completed tasks are only available on the full site, not the app. Still, the best I have found, and I've looked at a lot! UPDATE: Virtually all of the objections I had before have been fixed and functions added. Excellent!",
"This is wonderfully simple and functional app UPDATE 4/30: Lately I've been running into some limitations of this app. For example for some reason could not sort tasks when looking at the label, or on start screen. What is more troublesome are latest updates. For some reason they removed ability to customize start page. That's the feature I relied on day to day. They have also made mobile app LESS convenient to use. I am now afraid to complete tasks by accident due to change in app layout.",
Updare May 19 Continuous improvement keeps this as leading the pack. I have used most of the leading apps and this really does work for everyday tasks and projects to a surprising degree albeit if you are a serious project manager you will not find it functional enough eg no scope for direct export to project management or gannt function.,
"""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Mit diesem kurzen Statement wurde ein Kernfeature der App einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten Workflow. Auf Nachfrage beim Support bestätigt dieser, dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann, ""wann genau"" ein ähnliches Feature dahingehend kommen wird. ""Generell zukünftig"" hieß es da nur. Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden. Siehe Oben.",
"Tried many of the to do list apps, and I've found this one to be the best. Simple, fast, and easy to add and edit recurring tasks. Made me so much more efficient. Love it.",
This has helped with keeping my team on task and achieved department goals. I use this program daily to stay on task and to give me reminders.,
"Has become much worse when the sub tasks were removed, I liked having categories of my tasks sorted out into the categories. Please add back in the option to have subtasks show.",
todoist is like my brainextension. i use the app - which u find very intuitive to use as well as the chrome extension to manage my tasks and time.,
I've used Todoist since around 2016 and think it works brilliantly as a cross platform system to help with my organisation and project management. If you're dabbling with the GTD system then give this a whirl!,
"Greatest app ever. Tried many, this one, overall, provides the best overview of what beefs doing",
"Very happy, have been using it for several years to keep track of tasks due in the near future, and for some longer projects.",
This app is really helping my productivity. UPDATE: It's been almost three years since I wrote my original comments and I'm still using it.,
Such a beautiful app.i no need to switch around any other apps. Smart scheduling is one of the best feature and direct Google Calendar sync is an added bonus.wow I will stick to it forever. Great work Todoist team ☺️,
"ich würde ja 4,5 Punkte geben aber das geht nicht... das einzige was ich ein bisschen nervig finde ist das man um seinen Tag richtig zu planen und eine Benachrichtigung zu bekommen wann was ist bezahlen muss, abwr ansonsten Top App👌",
"Would like to see omnifocus style start dates and also better handling of recurring subtasks, but, other than that, this is a great program.",
"Since my first rating I have used Todoist for years. It is easy and powerful. It can be used in combination with Outlook, the email I must use at work. You can jot down quick reminders or organize complex projects or even keep detailed organized notes. You can set up filters to help you focus your work, which is very helpful. I love it and can't imagine using anything else.",
"There's some great work in the new updates. (Along with a tiny* number of horrendous usability issues.) Overall, a great application.",
Have been using todoist premium for 2+ years. it has become key in my productivity both personally and professionally.,
"I've been looking for an app like this for some time. I love the very easy integration between computer, phone, and various programs. I'm going to try a month free of premium and an hoping that I like the premium features as well as the free. If so, I'd gladly pay for this app.",
Short but steep learning curve - all good! Recent Improvements make it a 5 Star Application - Go Premium - Very Powerful,
This app has literally changed our lives. No more losing for 'the list'. No more having to rewrite our list. Great for coordinating appointments and obligations. Best to-do list I've found. Love being able to share info with spouse.,
Its useful and convenient. It relieves a lot of stress trying to remember and organize staff.,
"I use it for management of my business and personal life. Could not do without it. I use the web and phone app. Great for deadline and project subtask management. I've been using it for over 5 years, and my entire life is in this tool. it's indispensable!!",
Great app for productivity and keeping life together! Used everyday for last 3 years for daily to do items and current projects - business and home. Integrated with Evernote for notes and ideas. Highly recommended - well it works for me!,
"Great, great application for consolidating tasks and setting reminders. Awesome UI and great functionality. Easy to use as well! I'm hoping there was a way to go about setting task duration instead of just a single deadline! Otherwise, perfect! :-)",
Excellent way to take tasks off your mind into a seamless and frictionless experience for accomplishing your goals.,
I use this app to keep all of my projects organized and done on time. I love it. Awesome app!,
I don't know how I would live without Todoist,
Definitely keeps me more organized. I enjoy Todolist very much.,
Simply the best To-Do app I've used - and being steadily refined.,
great app! makes me feel productive even with the simplest tasks!,
best task management app. been using it for 5 years now.,
Don't work with Google Assistant.,
"2 years later, I still rate it a 5 star app.",
I love this app and I use it everyday to make sure I get everything done,

"O app é muito bom para organizar as tarefas diárias do dia, tem a opção de criar projetos e filtros que são muito bons, mas se pudesse ver o desempenho de cada projeto ficaria ainda melhor. Dá também para criar uma tarefa com muita facilidade e rapidez. Sugestão: quando o usuário finalizasse uma tarefa, o app poderia dispar um toque de conclusão, isso seria legal. E também qunsdo uma tarefa fosse finalizada ela nao sumisse na mesma hora, ela poderia ficar mais apagada com um traço em cima.",
👌👌👌,
👍👍👍👍👍,
I love the app but a possibility to put in task progress (0-100%) would be great! In the updated version when I select the filter 'view all' on my widget the subcategories are gone... And now all tasks are only ordered by priority without regard for category. That is very very confusing!! Please bring the categories back!! Or at least an option to show them again.,
"It's been a very useful app to me for a very long time, perfect to organize tasks and projects",
"Finally!!! Over 15 years of searching & countless requests of developers! Todoist is structured (RELIABLE SYNCING, LINKING, WIDGETS, SUBTASKS, PERFORMANCE, ""PLATFORMS"" & FUNCTIONS) the way people THINK and WORK!!! Progressive, intuitive and responsive developers! 4.00 Stars? 1. No Home screen ""shortcuts"" ( to individual tasks/projects) (too many clicks) 2. Inability to create task links in mobile app. No task/Project shortcuts & no mobile link creation is very inefficient & counter productive.",
"Working well for me. One of the best apps on Android, Windows and Web. Fast, flexible, easy. Reliable. Ticked all the boxes I was looking for except estimated & actual times.",
It would be useful to have a convenient way of looking at completed tasks and easily undoing them.,

"Suits me perfectly; has all the functions I require, and I love that I can use it everywhere - laptop, mobile, Chrome, Thunderbird ... I rarely buy software and the free version is great, but the full version is just too good to not buy! Great programme that I never want to be without! Almost six years later (I can't believe it's been that long) I'm still subscribing to the full version and still loving it! Have since dispensed of Thunderbird, but Todoist works equally well with Gmail 😊",
i never understand why they never update or upgrade thier bad subtask? working under 2 years (I am using premium account) and managed hundred projects which I seen this app to weak too continue. I cannot handle subtask and moving them together that is really problems but they never fixed. i think i will change another for next project. this is enough. thank you,
"Good, clean interface and useful widgets. Premium is a bit expensive but does everything I need",
Love this app!! I can't say enough about how easy it is to organize projects and daily tasks.,
"The app and the web app are really good. They have definitely improved. Wish there was a Scrum or overall progress reports area for individual and teams. A natice kanban view os coming soon. The natural language for setting due dates as well as tags, and overall user interface are nice and clean. They really need progress (% complete) or portfolio overviews especially for the business plan.",
"Exactly what I wanted in a digital to do list. Works brilliantly, have never experienced a glitch. 10/10 😁",
"Really helps me get organized every week without fail, and ensures I get everything I had planned done.",
"The greatest todo list app ever, I am now a Grand Master xD",

"really good, helps me to feel on top of things and clear my head. when I finish my to-do's for the day I actually feel satisfied and productive and like I can relax guilt-free and without feeling like I'm procrastinating. Its also good for when you think of something or remember something you need to do, but cant or dont want to do it that second- I used to.feel guilty or stressed when putting things off, now I just put it in todoist and schedule it and know itll get sorted :) honestly great app",
Removed two stars because of the horrible checkboxes. Changing things like that without a option to disable is a disrespect to paying customers. [previous 5 star review] Recommended for anyone who wants the most feature filled to-do list. Tested a lot of them and this really stands out. You can adapt it to a lot of workflows and the new integrations made it even better!,
"i dont like the new update. tapping the circle to finsish taps is not nearly as satisfactory as the swipe from before. more importantly however, this means i very easily mark tasks as done from the widget by accident as it only requires one tap now. (before the widget required 2 taps to mark a task done which is how wdgets should be).",
This is my principal to do app. The one thing lacking is Google tasks integration. That is what would make it 5 star app for me.,
"Todoist wasn't broke and the latest update, which replaces the second-nature left swipe with checkboxes, ain't no fix.",
Great app but please give an option to disable checkboxes. I hit them all the time by accident and there's no Undo on the widget :-(,
Been using it for over 2 years now. Indispensable - - and a life saver!,
There's a bug where I can't check off an individual task. But can for multiple at the same time,

"Helps get stuff done. The built-in ""Karma"" scoring keeps you on your toes. Methods for breaking long overdue / much-postponed tasks into more manageable chunks would be great. The PC desktop and Win10 app have come a long way too.",
It really helps me keep up with my to-do list everyday and very easy to use. Can I suggest? I hope that there is a SMS notification free of charge for tasks that are due currently and also a pop up window appears on screen for all list of unfinished task (android phone). It would be great if you will consider such a development in near future. My congratulations to Todoist team! God bless!,
I wish it would update my calendar with the time things are happening. still love this app. if you have alot of tasks and follow ups to keep track of buy premiem. it is well worth it.,
"It's an amazing app. You can add tasts to different projects with different priority levels, and with the premium version you can easily duplicate tasks and creat recurring ones.",
Really useful tool - I use it every day. A little bug here it there but nothing too bad.,
Easy to use. The ability to use it for work and personal items and then to be accessible on any platform or from where ever I'm at is very helpful. 2 years using this now and still utilizing every day. I got the premium version so that I can utilize attachments and comments to their fullest. Love this App!😉,
I wish you could have a better view and stadistics of completed task. sometimes the serch funtion doesnt even work.,
"I like the way it automatically sets date and priority, but it took some getting used to. I also really like the way the quick add-new-tasks-button works in the app, I wish the widget also worked this way",
Well designed and highly intuitive. This app has literally been the focal point of my efficiency that is leading me to success!,
"I've tried many to do apps over the years and this is one of my favorites. Easy to use but powerful and fast, just what you want in a productivity app. Love the Karma feature, all about gamifying everything to make me do more...",

This app is the complete package! It has saved my life in keeping track of all my tasks as a pastor that oversees several ministries. I would argue that it is better than Wunderlist or Google notes. (edited 1/31/19 I now pay for the premium 😁),
I love ToDoist! The only thing I find a bit off-putting is the limit placed on use of categories. But it certainly keeps me focused and on track in both my professional and personal life.,
"This app helps me stay on track. Instead of worrying about forgetting things that have to be done, I take a moment and add them to my list.",
I feel like I've gotten more productive since I got this app. It's also great for reminders.,
"This is a great app. It allows me to organize myself in a way in line with the GTD method, which I like. I really do like the app and am trying to completely run my life out of it now!",
having tried pretty much every Todo app there is nothing else that comes close to the simple yet flexible approach Todoist has and the integration with other apps and iot is amazing. still loving it,
couldn't survive without todoist. been using it for many years to run to successful business!,
"I put my entire life into this app, and this app has improved my entire life.",
this is a key element of my productivity system along with a note application and calendar.,

"I absolutely love Todoist! I have told so many people about it and have been getting them as obsessed as I am. It's so helpful and I absolutely love how organized it keeps me. I'm big on making lists and it totally aids with that! I also really love the quick add notification, I use it all the time when I think of things to do while I'm doing different things on my phone. I highly, highly recommend this app to everyone who is big on to do lists!",
"would be great to easily edit subproject names inside parent folder from widget and from parent folder view. now only possible to do so by entering subproject and then edit or by editing projects. still need timer, and stopwatch (for example by typing ""timer 10"" it starts 10 min countdown)",
Returned a few years later. 😂,

items/tasks disappear; Search is hard to use; Annoying user interface to enter due dates that require you to remember esoteric lexicon to do things like reoccurring dates.,

Sometimes confusing,
"My go-to task manager. Only wish is for multiple email addresses to be associated with one account. Oh, and the ability to share projects and sub-projects in one action.",
Have been using it for over 4 years now. Simple interface and easy to use. Easy to reschedule tasks too. It's become an integral part of my workday to start by seeing my Todoist list every morning,
Any chance that we can get the *task function to work at the *project level so that we can have entire projects that can function as checklists where we see the tasks completed? This is the best to do app and I have a huge interest in making it better!,
"Works great on phone, consistently crashes on open on Skagen Falster 2",
"Lets you keep a tab on daily routine, and keep you reminded of important jobs",

Subscription premium,
"A case when Corporate Design becomes TOO important. E.g colors for priorities might look more harmonious, however decrease the usability because they are harder distinctable.",
This to do list app is great. It was exactly what I was looking for. Bought thr subscription. Very useful for keeping track of work/development tasks as well as personal everyday tasks,
This app provides seamless integration of todoist with Android phones. It is one of my most valuable and most used apps.,
Wish they'd revamp their UI to take better advantage of large displays... otherwise the app works fine!,
"What happened to DashClock support ? Was just a small thing that I found useful, not sure if it was moved to Premium, as I don't see any mention in the changelog. 12/19: Managed to find 13.3.2, I'll stay on that version.",
"A lot of potential but premium features are too expensive, and simple actions like reminders should be free.",
"""add task"" feature with date AND TIME is ok now",
good app,
"Everything works fine except for the reminder notification push on Android device. For some reason, it rarely pushes notifcation at the time I specified, sometimes, it got delayed upto hours after the set reminder. Developers, please address this problem so that we can have timely notification to remind us of our tasks. Thank you!",
"Great app! Does most of what I want. I wish it had a way of organizing recurring daily tasks in a specific order, so they don't need to be arranged each day.",
"No app comes anywhere close to todoist's design, ease of use, functionality.",
App is back in development but missing rudimentary features like adjusting snooze time on each notification not offered,
"It would be great if you could add Todoist as a lock screen that shows today's tasks every time I open the phone. And even better if there could be an option to lock the phone for a selected time so that only the lock screen shows and there is no way to open distracting apps during that time. Also the reminding features are not very helpful, it would be great if Todoist could ring or do something to remind me when to start tasks.",
"Searching for the right Todo app has been a task (no pun intended) but I knew I found the right one when I stumbled across Todoist. This app is simply amazing! Talk about organization... You build Projects, then sub-projects, then daily routines, then work lists, the examples are endless... It's great. They days of ""what else do I need to do"" are gone! If your a business professional, or just a regular Joe looking for simple organization- Todoist is for you. Premium version is well worth the yearly subscription. Thanks Team Todoist!",
يحتاج بال رايق و معقد مو مثل ما اتوقعت وقت ثاني يمكن احمله,
You rock!,
Loved it😍,
Just wonderful,
Well done,
nice,
Good,
Awesome,
No function to link uninstalled,
Nice,
"... and I've used the lot. This is hands down the best for managing lists, tasks and priorities.",
Cornerstone of staying sane in my world.,
Why would I pay for reminders?,
"Why am I tapping on a ""greater than"" symbol at the end of a calendar just to get to the window where I can set the time for a due date reminder? What was wrong with the previous format? It should be like this: (1) Tap on the date in the calendar, then the time/clock window pops up (2) Tap on the hour to choose the hour (3) Tap on the minute mark 4) Tap on AM or PM. This isn't rocket science. They've turned a simple task into a chore. Precisely what nobody needs.",
Just perfect !,
"Thank you, thank you, thank you for this update because it has made my task scheduling easier and less confusing. It is especially helpful with that little notification if I have any task that has already been scheduled before (great in spotting clash of task). This little bit has made everything seem less daunting of a task list because I can evenly spread out task for the entire day. Once again, thank you for the latest update!",
"The best task manager in the store. I love how they keep the app up to date and write details of there improvements so I know what the update entails. Doist desires to provide a quality product and has earned my business, definitely worth the subscription cost with the amount of time this app saves me each day.",
Adding an option under settings to allow for lists and subtasks to not be automatically collapsed would be very useful for larger phones.,
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Brilliant,
"Edit: review changed since I was told about the calendar sync (which I want aware of before) and the widget don't freeze anymore either. I really like this app. The only reason I'm not giving it give stars is because the widget tends to freeze (the date don't change and you can't check things off), which happens on both my phone and my tablet, and because there's no month/calendar view. If these things were to be fixed, this app would be perfect.",
"I love todoist for many reasons, it's my second brain and easily the best to do list app out there. The fact you can access it on your phone, browser and desktop and that it integrates into outlook makes it super useful! 👍🏻",
Since the latest update I can't tell how to adjust the time of existing tasks... Will revert to an older version,
Beautifully minimalistic interface is very easy to use. Allows me to easily keep track of tasks and sub-tasks in a project. Notifications are useful and informative.,
Too expensive.,
Thank you for fixing colors in dark theme,
"I organise my tasks hierarchically into categories, in a style similar to GTD. Todoist offers the flexibility I need and doesn't enforce arbitrary conventions on me. The desktop app and especially the new dark theme are welcome additions to an already amazing app. Todoist is central to my ability to stay focussed and organised and get things done. One feature for which I yearn: the option to have a location-based task only pop up a notification if sub-tasks remain unfinished. I don't want to have an entire shopping list of sub-tasks flood my notification bar, nor do I want to receive an alert every time I pass that location if there are no sub-tasks.",
One of the greatest to-do apps. Great if you don't feel that basic apps like Any.do do it for you. PS: Just tried the new Dark Theme. You should really make a theme that changes from dark to light depending on the time. That would be really awesome.,
It took forever but u guys did it. Thanks for implementing the dark them option. Now one more feature to go to make it the perfect todo list app; persistent notification that shows today'a tasks.,
"I like the flexibility for scheduling tasks, the ability to share, and the integration with IFTTT. Prior problems I had have been fixed.",
Break your to do list into small tasks and prioritise. It really helped me.,
Great task manager. So much you can do with it. I love the new dark mode option.,
I love the fact that tasks can be categorized and the filters by more then one option,
Dark theme! Bless you people,
Thank you so much for the dark theme!,
Dark theme has arrived after nearly 10 years! It looks clean AF!,
Widget force close app all the time,
muito bom pra se organizar e estipular metas,
Amazing!,
Loved it❣️,
It good.,
Life feels better,
Tops App!,
never loads on s8+,
👍,
"I love this app. As a busy mom of four Todoist helps me keep everything together. Women, that mental load we carry where we are always thinking of the household tasks to be done, the phone calls to make, the errands, the ingredients to pick up at the store, that one thing we ran out of at home, the tasks for our small business, and the zillions of other projects that we manage? Get it out of your head or off the sticky notes scattered around the house and put it all in this app. You can organize tasks by project, assign due dates if needed, set recurring tasks, and also prioritize tasks. There's also the ability to add tasks from email, which I never use, but it's there. I also like that I can see trends and what I've completed over time. I think the paid app is worth it, but I used Todoist for probably two years before I upgraded. The free one was still highly useful.",
"Легкий дизайн. Удобство использования. Много функций. По-сравнению с wunderlist, однозначно лучше.",
AWESOME APP!,
Very useful!,
Good app,
good,
"This app helps me stay on top of my work everyday and works extremely well as a critical part of my phone's home screen, letting me see what I have to do/should be doing whenever I open my phone to procrastinate on those very tasks. Works great most of the time and has a very sensible/aesthetic design.",
"Worst pricing model ever. I wanted to try application for managing my daily task. I installed application and created my first task. Then I accidently clicked complete. So I wanted to mark it as incomplete. But I can't do it I have to buy $29 plan to mark it incomplete. Instantaly unistalled application. Improve pricing model. Maybe you don't want to target Students. Only working professional who can pay. Edit 1 Improving rating for student discounts, but still change pricing model. Limiting entire feature, instead providing limit on number of task or number of sub task. So that we can at least try feature and judge whether it is worth buying",
"I am very old-school, and thus prefer pen and paper, so the idea of keeping everything in a screen device had me very skeptical, that I'd be able to understand it, or even simply use it, but it is absolutely wonderful! Extremely user-friendly and amazingly helpful. Now, I put almost everything in it and never forget a thing. I'm not even sure how I did without it for all these years!",
"The experience on Chromebook is not good, mainly the app on chromebook does not remember its position and resized window when it's closed (desktop mode). Every time you open the app on the desktop mode, todoist opens up minimized on the top left corner.",
Best task app on the app store. Worth the premium version too. I've had MLO which wants you to pay for every device and then when they do a version upgrade they charge you for a whole new version on every device and they have a pricey cloud backup too. So this app is simple to use and just and powerful as MLO at a fraction of the cost. I'm really loving it!!,
"Getting started can be initially time consuming, but there are plenty of blogs and resources to get you on course. It's a great help to my week to have a place for my tasks in one versatile app (rather than on sheets of my notepad that must be written over and over again.) I highly recommend this app. If used to its fullest capabilities, it can really change your life!",
"Simple, yet useful. The design allows a sort of ""constant"" To-Do list, and tasks uncompleted from previous days get moved or notated, so that you don't forget that you still have to do them.",
"This is a really great app. Easy to use and intuitive. Syncs with the web really fast. My only complaint is that they updated the date picker, but the old one was better, more efficient.",
Long time user of Todoist. Very useful tool for planning my day to day business and personal activities. Shame Newton email has closed down as currently there is no android email app that integrates with Todoist. Hopefully someone will pick up where Newton left off.,
"The system time zone settings on both my phone and computer are correct. But the time zone setting in my Todoist account is the generic ""GMT+8"" time zone. After changing my Todoist account time zone to the same offset but with a specific city (""Beijing GMT+8"") the problem went away.",
So far it is the only thing capable of cataloging my multitude of todos among various project UPDATE. please be able to add a task to your schedule and have its subtasks show up in place if they exist. When you complete a subtask have it be replaced automatically by the next subtask in the task... that would be so much better than having to schedule each subtask to come up... sometimes you're working on a project and just need to have what's next come up and not go look. And scheduling everything is unrealistic. All you can do is put dye dates when they exist and then put an order of importance,
"The app is great overall, but I cant reach customers service team to support me on time when I need them. Right now, I still havent heard any responses from the team",
Still trying to figure it out. But I've already found ways for it assist me with my lifestyle project management.,
"Just a great to do list manager. Love it. Works great across browsers, windows and Android. About my only complaint is lack of native linux version.",
"This is by far the best task list app. The free version doesn't lack anything vital, and there are no ads.",
"Excellent app. Helping with my hectic schedule. Great for my ideas that race through my mind most days. Also, I'm a procrastinator by nature and this helps keep it at Bay.",
"Only app ever I bought a subscription without any hesitation. Affordable, not intimidatingly complicated and well designed. Also integrates with all kinds of tools like Discord, Calendar and Gmail.",
Easy to use. Awesome functionalities to help keep track of tasks. Never miss another task on your life.,
"I feel so much more organized! The labeling, scheduling and assignment features (along with the ability to attach files) helps me feel much less overwhelmed, especially when tackling large projects. Highly recommend!",
Love this app. I am using it from 2 year but from some days I am not able to add task on widget.,
"Good app to help me with my productivity you can assign dates to tasks, you get reminders as opposed to tasks written in a book that you will not see daily",
"I have probably used every single to do app out there, but I keep coming back to Todoist. Recently, they solved a huge usability pain point by changing the interface for rescheduling to-do items. I don't think I have a single gripe about the app at this point.",
The app was amazing but they just made some very bad changes that make the app cumbersome to use and completely not logical.,
Exactly the right amount of organization without being overly complicated. The interface is beautiful and works seamlessly across all devices.,
"App is great and ultra easy to use. I love it's clean look but I can't set reminders for multiple days. For example, if I want a task to repeat every Monday, Tuesday and Friday I have to do each one separately",
You have to pay for reminders. I'll just use a free app. Not worth paying for such a simple feature.,
Why must i register with facebook(dont have fb) google or email? Why cant i use the app as a stand alone on my phone? All this interconnection is bs! Easier to just buy a diary at the store and write in it like the old days!,
"Great app for task schedule. Extremely user friendly. Worth burying a premium. Oh, wait, the premium is affordable!",
Overall very happy. For a task list manager it works very well. I wish I could look at future weeks pending tasks (vs only the next 7 days) so that I could balance out progress on tasks with multiple milestones.,
I'm using this APP for almost a year already. It improved my life for a bit. Happy to recommend.,
Very easy and useful layout that allows me to get my work done on time stay organized. Definitely recommend.,
This App has really helped me out with a lots of things,
It's a great app but what the hell happened to the time change function in the last update? I like being able to postpone or whatever but not being able to use the clock to change the time and return to typing is annoying.,
"""Sign In With Email"" causes the app to crash on ChromeOS. Unusable.",
"Since update, setting due TIME is impossible! Please fix!!",
Loving it so far! The integration with outlook and chrome has definitely helped a lot!!,
So helpful!! I love being able to create events that repeat,
"Simple, straight forward, sync with all devices whether it's IOS or Android. Love it",
allows subtasks under subtasks under subtasks...something others don't do. love it,
Very handy and straightforward. Runs as App on all systems or in browser. Stable and fast,
"Good App, want to see more integration with Google Keep etc",
"Todoist is simple to use, yet powerful when it comes to organizing your life and boosting your productivity.",
This is very good but any feature is locked.at least unlock the reminder.,
"Easy to use, understands what you want it to do. Amazing.",
Great app. The best I have found.,
A very nice task manager.,
Great for recurring and timed to-dos and notes,
Excellent one to keep you on track and increase productivity,
Cool and easy to manage to-do app.,
Great little app to help get yourself organised.,
It does exactly what I downloaded it for.,
great app. makes me do more and more every day,
"The best app ever!!! Easy, fast, multi-device, cooperative, nice UX, loved it <3",
Easy to use and nags me when i need it,
"Nice app, even the free features are adequate",
Easy to use and to organize my tasks,
One word awsome app.,
amazing app and an amazing API thank you,
Worst pricing model.,
Reminders should not be a premium feature.,
Helps me to keep track with all my tasks and assignments.,
"Easy, intuitive, helpful... Love it",
Great app!,
"It's very useful, thanks.",
Thanks a lot for the best app,
Perfect for me.,
It's good,
Still learning how to use,
Wow it improved a lot,
Very useful,
Super convenient,
Great app,
Awesome app,
I lost my shoe,
Terrible,
Love it,
The shizzle,
I like it,
Works well,
"Great app, premium subscription is a little pricey for what you get, but the basic version works just fine anyway. It's simple, not to complex with the options, and everything is listed right there by category and priority, so you can easily see what needs to be done. I actually like that you can list everything without a time on it, I just mark the priority and start at the top and complete one task, then check the next one and proceed until the day ends, and I'm actually more productive that way than if I had a schedule with certain hours for certain things. This way I can do each task until it is done, then go to the next task, instead of stopping in the middle of one task because it's time for the next one-I always just end up with a bunch of unfinished tasks and feeling scattered and like I haven't really accomplished anything that way. So anyway, good app, like it.",
"I really enjoy using Todoist, it syncs perfectly with my desktop and other 
devices. I use it for work and personal tasks, it truly helps me to keep 
track of everything and stay organized. The price is very low and 
affordable which is a huge bonus as well. One thing I would recommend for 
the team is to create a calendar view that would allow people to see all 
the tasks in the month at once in small boxes like any other calendar app. 
That would be awesome, other than that everything is perfect! :)",
"One of my most-used apps, and one of the best put-together apps I've ever 
come across. Strictly in terms of 'to do' apps, I've tried many before this 
and always found myself seeking another one. No more. Todoist has so many 
features and they're really well executed.",
"Premium in order to comment on a task? Extortion. Yet your 1st three 
projects allow comments... deceptive. Comments are too basic and essential 
to make the free version worth (the time/energy) adopting. And I can't 
consider a subscription-based premium commitment with a company that can't 
concede that option.",
"This tool is exactly what I want to manage my to-do lists. It is feature-rich, yet still very easy to use, with very intuitive interfaces on my Android phone and on my desktop browser. I like the many ways of organizing tasks: assign due dates, assign priorities, group by home work or other ""project"" names, etc. These are all optional, and don't get in the way of listing what you want to do today and manually sorting the list using drag and drop. After trying quite a few other tools both free and paid, I am very glad to have found this well-designed product.",
"Fantastic app. Like all productivity styles, it has its pros and cons - 
whether you enjoy this is approach is subjective on that basis. Pros: 
*cross-platform support. *collaboration tools. *smart keywords (""pick up 
laundry next Wednesday"" will schedule the task appropriately) *nesting and 
grouping of tasks and subtasks *supports Projects and labels 
(tags/categories) *generally strong integration. Open APIs, native android 
widgets, etc Cons: *limited calendar integration *labels limited to 
one-per-task (restricts how you can use them for thematic reviews) *no 
templates for storing recurring projects",
"Great app. Its easy to add to-dos from any device which means you never miss something. I think its necessary to spend a good 10-15 minutes a day organising your to-dos into projects and setting due dates/times on as many of the tasks as possible, otherwise it just becomes an overwhelming task pit. Most importantly, though, is having a solid system in place. Im personally trying the 'GTD system' and so far its helping me clear my head, prioritise and focus on the stuff i need to get done. Definitely worth paying for premium if you use it properly.",
"Love this app, actually thinking of upgrading to premium membership as I'm 
completing tasks I need to do on time, first time ever! You can't add 
photos/screenshots though, I hope that this is something they can do in the 
future, as it would be really useful especially when creating projects.",
"Love it and hate it.. Love that it allows creation of tasks quickly with 
smart date time scheduling on the go..and, I hate the app because push 
notifications for reminders which is a basic and needy feature happens to 
be a premium level feature -- ironically, competing apps like the beautiful 
Wunderlist allows it for free..Hence, taking away 2 stars from the 5 
because, the free app is basically useless..as a single errand user, 
without reminders push notifications, we can basically get things done with 
a scratch pad too. I'd suggest single errand or daily task users to try 
Wunderlist instead. This app is targeted only for multi device corporate 
users.",
"The widgets, sync between devices, Google assistant integration - all these things make this an actually useful, practical tool. great.",
"Easy to use and great interface. My brain isn't fried trying to remember 
everything now! I love that it's easy to create categories and projects for 
the to do items.",
"> There should be a 'Select all' option to select all to-dos immediately. > For some reason, we can immediate select a priority for multiple to-dos, but not for just one. Same goes with moving to-dos to another project list > The sort by date and sort by priority option should be in a checklist system, where if you check them, any to-dos that you have made or have applied dates and or priorities to them will automatically be organized. > To-dos that have no dates should be listed at the top (when sorted by dates) Overall, thus app is amazing, extremely useful for people who want to organise their to-do list.",
"Great app for keeping on top of all your tasks, lots of functionality and 
cross platform ability. Don't know what I'd do without it!",
"Best to do list app I've found so far. I really like the widget for this app as well, it makes it harder to ignore my growing to do list 😅. I give this app a 10/10 (from a severe procrastinator)",
"Another list app that requires an account... Why would you need my bleeping 
email address??? No thanks. It's incredible that so many people are still 
willing to trust their personal info on some unknown server especially 
after so many mass security breeches.",
"This is one of the best Android apps out there. Fantastic UX that is 
optimized for productivity, but still looks great and fully honours 
Material design.",
"Able to get tasks completed on time. Love the fact that i can tick them off 
as i complete my tasks",
"Dovetailing with Google calendar is awesome, adding event in one adds it to 
the other, same with deleting, and completing a task in ToDoist erases it 
from GCal, perfect.",
"Great app. Excellent to do list. I Just dont like that the app e-mails me 
every day.",
As a task manager this App is really useful. With different labels and option of different levels of priority one can easily organise his different roles in life,
"Best to-do list app I've found. It's quick and easy to create and complete 
tasks. I also like that you can create projects, set priorities and set 
tasks to repeat",
"It is a really useful app to make todo lists and it gives peace of mind to 
have a list. It is easy to reschedule the tasks and you can just type a 
date.",
"Would like to see a way to quantify tasks and progress (i.e. completed 
1/5), Outlook integration, time estimates on tasks, 'backlog' or holding 
area, better category support, and custom themes/more colors along some 
other quality of life improvements.",
This is a great application for keeping track of the crazy lives we all lead. As a software developer I love the simple and intuitive UI and I love the quick responsiveness. Great download!!,
"App does not even offer a limited trial period. All ""advanced"" features are set as premium options which have to be paid for. How do is a user supposed to pay with the assumption that whatever is tagged as a ""premium"" option is indeed, all that!?",
It's forte is it's ubiquitous access with all devices. The reminders for updating scheduled tasks are the best even if they are annoying to a novice tasker like me.,
"It really helps me keep a schedule that syncs nicely, definitely has made 
me more productive.",
"A breeze to use. Extremely fast input, e.g. ""Call John tmr 3pm #work 
@ProjectA"". Excellent multi device support. Google Assistant voice support 
is a bonus",
Only had it a few days but it's very useful and I will continue to use it.,
Have reccomended to multiple friends. Has seriously helped my stress levels and productivity.,
"Great app, quick easy way to create todos and easy way to track tasks. 
Integration with many Apps is a huge plus.",
"Super convenient and simple way to manage tasks and due dates, and then assign them to different categories. Love it!",
"Excellent tool for managing your to do list. So easy to use and works 
across devices to sync your tasks.",
"It is one of few applications I use daily. Thanks so much, guys!",
"Having tried other apps and a diary Todoist is the most helpful for me... 
So easy to use I'm way more productive...",
"Great and simple app, which really works for keeping all those jobs in mind 
and prioritised.",
Revolutionary for my productivity. The only organisational app that has made any difference!!,
"Great app, lots of features for keeping organised and very easy and simple 
to use.",
"I like the ability to interact with Outlook or Chrome mail. The reminders 
and filters are good as well.",
Very nice app which syncs with all devices. Nice interface and reports,
Best ToDo app. Easy integration with Alexa. Very easy to use quick add tasks. Very good.,
"Great app. Has everything you need for task management + good developer 
support.",
Very good app for making to do list for everyday activities,
its good to remind us about our job thank you anyway,
"Make lists, get things done",
"Helps me stay on track for the day, the next, or in a month from now.",
Great way to track stuff. Simple and easy to use.,
This app don't work with Google home. What a drawback!!!,
Seriously impressive for a simple and smooth toggling to-do app,
A great tool for getting the right tasks done at the right time👍,
Has become a part of my life.,
"cool and easy to use, serves the purpose, does exactly what its meant for...",
Love the ease of using this app between drvices,
Quite good. Would like to have 'Notes' option,
We can make to do list and share with others....,
Very easy to use... And sync across devices,
"Using it more then a year, nice app",
Great app. Well organized,
Great task management app!,
It's the best out there,
Great app!,
Good for simple stuff.,
"Amazing , simple to use, clean interface ... Five stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",
"Love, love, love this app",
Good as a supplement to trello and similar,
Love this app.,
It's great,
Great!,
Nice App,
Great app,
Great app,
Great app,
Great app,
Good,
Reminders as a primary feature?,
Awsome,
Does the job.,
Rexommendation apps,
Works well,
Wondrerful app,
Yeeeeeet,
"Generally I am pleased with this app except that it does not let you 
""uncheck"" a checked item and move it back to the to-do list, at least as 
far as I can see. I found this to my chagrin when I used the app to make a 
packing list and then could not retrieve the list when I wanted to reuse 
it. I am now making my packing lists in a paper planner as a result. This 
would be a very useful feature if the developers would care to add it.",
"Recently moved to Android from iOS and had to give up Omnifocus. Todoist is 
a strong competitor with OF and I'm finding the custom filters as powerful 
as OF custom perspectives. Overall, Todosit is among the best task 
management apps you can get and is available everywhere (web, Android, 
iOS), which makes capturing tasks incredibly easy no matter where you are.",
"I decided to try out this app based on a review I read elsewhere, and I can 
honestly say I am glad I did. I love this app (enough to go premium) and 
use it across all of my devices. I'm very much someone who likes lists and 
being able to tick things off of them! I don't don't use it as part of a 
team but I can see how powerful tool it can be. The fact it syncs with 
Alexa and Google Calendar (amongst others, it's also IFTTT compatible). 
Just one request... Please could you add the ability to change the colour 
and/or transparency of widget.",
"I was looking for something quick, easy and simple. Nothing fancy. Just a 
basic to do list. This is it. Works with my calendar. And gives me 
reminders. Only draw back is no recurring tasks. I don't pay for the 
upgrades, but may look into that in the future.",
"The sole ability to group and prioritise tasks under different project is 
AWESOME. Setting recurring tasks is even better, but this app can do so 
much more. I love it.",
"Great to-do app that looks good and is simple to use. Would give it 5 stars 
if not for key features needing premium sub",
"Todoist is the indispensable tool without which my job and my daily life 
would go out of control. It gives me full flexibility to organizenmy tasks 
by project, add tags, prioritize and schedule. I also like the design.",
"Good app but I wish it functioned more like the website. There is too much 
extra clicking to do simple things.",
"Todoist has kept me going through good times and rough times. It's a great 
help.",
"I feel that it does it's purpose well, the UI is easy enough to navigate 
though I wish they could improve how they schedule things by date",
"I would like to be able to buy my software. Dont need monthly subscription 
to use premium features if al software i use does that i would need to be a 
millionair to use my software. Uninstalling.",
"Even for a basic feature like task reminder it tells you to upgrade to 
'premium' when there are so many apps that lets you do it for free. 
Uninstalled.",
"Todoist has revolutionised my work life. I'm able to manage work easily 
whether in the car, home or office. I know what tasks are due or coming due 
and I'm pretty sure I'm on to top of everything, whatever the project. Love 
it.",
"Does exactly what it says on the tin. Great for adding a quick task in a 
meeting or when sitting on the train and then reminding me to do it.",
"Excellent app for to do list integrate easily with a lot of devices and 
platform. The best to do list app I have tried so far.",
"So fun! At last a list maker tool that thinks the same way I do!Thank you 
todoist for simplifying and organizing my life!",
"Really helps me with work, as I have a no stop work life and this app 
really helps not to forget the little things.",
"A great way to keep track of everything I need to do, as well as the tools 
to organize it in order to help me get those things done.",
"Overall good app, but most useful features are premium only, so I'll 
recommend everyone to just pair this app with others such as Evernote or 
Notion.",
"Easy to use, the free version is pretty basic. Like the projects and 
ability to link tasks to the project. More of the functionality I want is 
available if I pay for premium but I'm too tight!",
"Simply the best app for organizing your projects and todo's. Works on most 
every platform and has an excellent integration into Google calendar for 
those that time block like myself. Todoist is the best!",
"App seems to work really well for leaving one's self a reminder, but not 
what I need. I need an organizer w/ more options. That being said I would 
still recommend this app for reminders.",
"So far, it's been great for a lot of little things, shopping lists and so 
on, am learning more of the great features.",
"Good lists and reminder functionality @ basic level. 'Premium' features 
must be paid for despite being fairly standard extensions.",
"I have used a lot of ""To Do"" apps and I always comeing back to this one. I 
really have tried them all and every time there is always something 
missing. Todoist has it all, it even integrates with Toggl which is really 
handy. I would highly recommend this app.",
"Love this. I have downloaded so many organization apps and not used them. I 
am actually using this every day.",
"Easy, intuitive and advanced. Perfect for managing day-to-day tasks and for 
organising almost any project!",
"Good app but would be good to be able to add a time estimate to tasks 
similar to Nozbe.",
"Pretty satisfy with the app. The ui is clean, simple and easy to understand.",
I could do everything that I wanted in a To-do-list app. Its a good one!,
It's clutter free design impressed me a lot!,
Very effective without being too intrusive. No complaints at all.,
Great tool improve productivity and keep in track your history,
Letting me subtask in Today mode would make it far better,
"Great app, very effective and easy to use!",
Using It for a few weeks now. Suits all my needs.,
"Just ok. There are competition apps too, but for a to do list, it's ok.",
Wonderful. First place I go to each morning.,
"Like the many features, such as priority, sub tasks, scheduling options, 
color coding, easy of editing.",
"It's amazing, this is a really good app",
This app is pretty useless without notifications.,
I love it! I'm implementing GTD and it's been wonderful!,
Just New to this app. Looks good,
Great features especially when deciding when to set a task for,
Good so far. Better than Anydo,
Should be add feature of repeat task daily or weakly or even monthly,
One of the best app out there,
Great for your tasks' organization in a smooth way,
Best app for becoming active.,
Gerat to keep you organised and plan daily goals..😘😘😘😎,
Works great!,
Just amazing app.,
Very useful app.Thanks a lot,
Very Good Smart Software,
A great organizational tool,
It's cool,
I need to pay for using labels ??!,
Love this!!,
Useful for remembering tasks,
Perfect.,
No dark mode,
Amazing yeyeye,
Very intuitive,
Awesome app,
great,
Love it,
Great,
Great,
Awesome,
"Forced to create a profile by linking it to personal information... If I 
want my data stolen I have Google, so thank you but no thank you.",
Helps.,
"This app is amazing for to do lists. It's interface is really simple and 
intuitive making it easy to write down when and what tasks you need to do 
and it's easy to tick them off. It also allows loads of other stuff like 
attaching files and categories, priority lists, tracking and comments and 
stuff like that. It also have loads of features that make it useful for 
professional teams like online project to do lists which multiple users but 
I haven't used those features as I use it for day to day stuff and school.",
"My boss used to tell me I had poor organizational skills and was unreliable 
and recommended I find a task organizer. I downloaded todoist and it 
changed my life. I liked it so much I purchased the advanced version for 
more features. Using todoist consistently has changed my life. At my end of 
year review with my boss he told me my communication and reliability has 
noticeably improved. An unexpected benefit is I am more organized with my 
tasks at home which has made my wife happy and even benefitted me 
financially. I realize this may sound like a paid ad, but I promise it is 
not. This is the first time I've ever submitted an app review. I just like 
todoist that much. There was a bit of a learning curve figuring out how to 
use all of the features to make the app seamless. But after about 2 weeks 
of consistent use it became very easy. The app syncs with my google 
calendar and sends push notifications and emails if you want. The advanced 
version allows you to write comments under the to-do item which makes it 
incredibly useful for organizing larger projects. An easy 5/5 for me.",
"Absolutely fantastic! Contains parent and child lists, repeatable tasks, 
priority settings, and consistent reminders. It's actually super easy to 
set up repeating tasks - you don't have to configure it manually, although 
you can. Also, the reward system of karma and levels really helps me keep 
going.",
"It's good to be able to separate task to different projects but upon the 
day itself, it shows the task needs to be done for today. You don't need to 
worry about other things other than today. The idea is to live in the 
moment, focus on task at hand and complete it.",
"Fantastic, works across all platforms and does it quickly and reliably. 
Totally recommend even if you don't go the paid version. Get used to the 
couple of keyboard shortcuts, get the extension for Chrome, is great. Use 
it's intuitiveness as well then it becomes quick and efficient.",
"I'm *liking* a todo-list app for the first time ever. The UX is genuinely nice, snappy and unobtrusive, the organizing features are ample without being cluttery, and there's problem-free sync and interoperability between Mac app, phone, and web, and between myself and others in shared projects.",
"Elegant simple perfect to do list manager. Its gradually taking over more 
and more areas of my life. And it's everywhere-- phone browser desktop etc. 
Anytime I'm worried I'll forget some small obligation, I add it into this 
app and relax.",
"This app has helped me be way more productive. I usually put in a to do 
list for things I need to do the night before. I have found using this app. 
I am able swipe things off faster than I would do a written list. So good 
and I highly recommend. Saves so much time and works wonders.",
"I've tried many personal/project management apps, but this seems to be the 
one that I have stuck with. Definitely recommend.",
"Simply unbeatable for the prioritised to do list writer. Premium isn't 
really needed - key feature that's premium only is reminders, but if you're 
using it for everything everyday you'll be on the app anyways so reminders 
become less important.",
"The best todo manager. Long time ago I manage my private and work todos to. 
Before Todoist tested more todo manager. Now, I don't want to change.",
"This has been so helpful for keeping track of the things I need to do. I 
especially love the recurring tasks and natural language processing 
features.",
"So far so good. Only used simply for to-do and small projects. Like to 
Google Calendar integration. Would rather pay for the app than a premium 
subscription so stuck with the basic features for now. Good app. Looks like 
it works with slack too.",
"This app is just good. Not what I looking for when I bought it, but is just 
ok. The thing is maybe I need to learn how to exactly use this app, because 
is not as intuitive as I like, or maybe my way to use it is different of 
what the app was created for.i don't know. Because is cheap I will maintain 
the app installed and still using it for the year. Otherwise I'll ask for 
refund.",
"Haven't figured out how to set notifications, just the email reminders. But 
I am able to keep up with my to do list with this app",
"Made it easy to share household tasks with my husband without feeling 
overwhelmed. I wish it had notetaking capabilities besides setting todo 
taks.",
"I've been using this app for three years now. Devs are improving usability 
and react to feedback. Core planning engine is already great.",
"I've used a lot of 'to do' list apps. This is the only one I've maintained 
for any length of time. I particularly like the gamification features to 
keep my motivated. They are light and unobtrusive, e.g. not a lot of 
annoying badges.",
"After evaluating Todoist Premium, I decided not to change my current 
workflow and requested a refund. In less than 3 minutes, both Todoist and 
Paypal processed the refund with no questions asked. A company worth five 
stars.",
"I'm a total to do list, type A personality, and this app has helped me take 
organization to the next level. I don't know where this app had been all my 
life, but I'm glad it's here now...",
"Great app to get things done! It helps you order your tasks in project and 
prioritize what's on your to do list. It would be nice to also be able to 
organise your tasks on a Gantt diagram to see which tasks comes before 
which.",
"Excellent layout, very intuitive. I have used several. None are perfect but 
this one seems to have the most important issues solved.",
"I love Todoist..not just for getting the productivity aspect sorted but 
also for the user experience. Amazing app",
"Enjoying the app. The sync between devices is very good, and I particularly 
like the browser extension for neat quick access",
"Sent a condescending reminder saying ""you're a novice"". I dont need this 
negativity in my life.",
"An app that works, that allows sharing lists and projects, with smart 
filters. And not to be forgotten, a smart company behind it that eats its 
own dog food and that is stable, not looking for an exit strategy, i.e. 
choosing this tool for a company is a sound one.",
"This app is super useful for day-to-day and weekly needs. I wish there was 
a way to ""flip"" between 7-day weekly views as in a regular paper planner.",
"It's a good app, has the basic features of a To-Do app. However, other free 
apps like Wunderlist have more features in the free plan than this one, 
like commenting a task or creating custom labels. It's a shame that 
Wunderlist will be shutdown",
"Great tool, good syncing & reminder service, only downside I add having to 
pay for basic upgrades like labels/colors.",
A good app that I used for a few years but now it's just too expensive. Plus the dollar/pound pricing parity just exacerbates the issue. Hence only 3 stars.,
"GTD user here. I'm so impressed with the functionality of this app for 
managing both tasks and projects. Love the layout and the ease of 
interfacing with the system once you get the hang of it and set it up.",
"Much better than writing endless lists. Sense of achievement when you 
complete something. Useful behavioural science, works for me anyway.",
"This used to work so well and is now unusable. Updating existing items is 
impossible. Recurrance is a nightmare. Reminders don't go off as set (or 
the setting is dropped without warning). Support is outdated.",
"The more you use Todoist, the better it becomes. An essential aid to my 
calender and syncs with GA/IFTTT nicely.",
"Helps INFJ's manage time and feel achievement. It's greatly impacted my 
output while decreasing my stress. It's a brain dump list...",
"convenient was using Wunderlist before and the transition was easy! It had 
all the features and then some, including things that made it more 
convenient. I have a few months of the paid version for free and I am 
unsure about the free version, however",
"Easy to use and will send me email reminders. Great way to do a brain dump 
before I go to sleep so I remember what I need to do the next day.",
"Honestly its amazing and it always notifys you. Get youre day scheduled up 
is a good way to live a stress free life and this app seems to help out 
with that.",
"Forces you to create an account. People just want to keep track of their 
tasks not go through all this for an app",
"Great app for scheduling and organizing. I love the 'Karma' and the 'Goal' 
features and how they make me be more excited to complete tasks. It's 
awesome.",
"This app is great and all, but the only problem I have with it is the 
premium stuff. They don't put a label or symbol on the premium features, 
but other than that, It's great",
"I'm new to using to doist hoping it will help me get back on track. I find 
I so easy to use and the ability to use across my devices. I may even 
purchase the premium version later. Nice!",
"Helps my husband and I stay on top of things together, we'd be lost without 
it!",
"Todoist has been really useful for me. As someone who has trouble 
remembering when to do things or what things I was supposed to do, an app 
that not only lets me write a static list but also allows for recurring 
items is fantastic.",
"I love this app. Location reminders and full syncing are excellent. 
Creating small projects for short lists is super easy. I recommend this to 
anyone who wants to simplify their life with todo lists.",
"I have been very forgetful since chemotherapy and this is exactly what I 
needed to organize my life.",
"Good App. Met my expectations! And the best part is it everything is on 
cloud, so that makes it perfect to be operated from either laptop or mobile 
phone.",
"OMG, I'm feeling so much clearer and progressing my projects with ease 
since coming back to todoist. Such a pleasure to use this app!",
"Great free app for keeping on top of To do list! Easily add a task, 
including date, time, project, priorty simply by typing it in such: Yoga 
tomorrow 9.30am p1 Automatically schedules it in with priority 1. Can also 
type in ""weekly"" or ""daily "" and it will do that.",
"Easy to use, actually gets me doing things instead of fiddling with my 
system...",
"Extremely helpful managing my dissertation and keeping all things to do!! 
Love it... simple and efficient.",
"This app has really helped me get back on the GTD wagon. Each phase of GTD 
is thoughtfully made easier to accomplish (collect, organize, do, review). 
Highly recommend this application!",
"I've been using todoist for years. It's an excellent app even with just the 
free version. It's super easy to use across different platforms (web, 
Android, iOS), and is extremely helpful in my day to day life. Thank you 
todoist!",
"Simple and clever. Also there an extension for chrome browser exist in play 
market. They are synchronized with the app, it's comfy.",
"I use it every day, every hour. It integrates with my other productivity 
apps. The best of the best.",
"Good app. But selecting date to add a record could have been dome more 
easier.",
"It's hard to get the hang of it at first. It's an advanced productivity 
tool that is hard to set up quickly and with ease.",
"Helps me organise what I need to do daily, love it!",
"Very useful for managing tasks, individually and for teams! Even in free 
plan!",
I've used a lot of task apps over the years and this is the best!,
"Love how it integrates with Google Calendar. Unlike AnyDo, I wish it had a 
calendar view.",
Overall simple and effective. But most of the time it's widget doesn't work,
Using this since very long time. Great tool.,
Really helping me get things done and become a lot more efficient!,
Intuitive - email reminder helpful. Have recommended to others due to ease.,
"Getting more done everyday. Wish the free version had more features. The 
website is more user friendly",
Best task management app I've ever used. Love the Zapier integration too.,
"Used on Windows 10 Phone, and even better here on Android❣️",
"This is the only app that actually made me do what i planned. Really loving 
it.",
"I think it is useful for seeing what you have that day and it make you alot 
more organised than before",
This app makes it easy to remember what comes next during the day.,
I run my life out of here now. It's fantastic,
This app helps keep me organized and makes me finish my to do list.,
"Time managing App, so that is mainly best feature I liked..",
"Love todoist. Use it every day!!! Have 1000's of tasks pre-planned for the 
months to come.",
Excellent way to keep tabs on your day-to-day. Helped me survive my finals.,
"Good, simple, effective. Wish there was a way for task to start and track.",
This is good but not connected with my mail or something like that,
Simple app with few shortcomings in free version but worth it.,
Really goof compared with google task,
Been using for years. Love it. It helps keepy life together.,
This app is perfect. Nothin I'd change,
I love it just I think it can be organized a bit better,
Does exactly what I need a good to do list app to do,
"Best task app that unites Alexa, Android, Windows, and more",
Would be nice to be able to edit the text (note),
"Comments or Notes for every Project should be free, don't have to upgrade. 
Thank you.",
Superb to-do app with location-based reminders.,
very helpful. this app motivates me to carry on my work,
Easy way to keep my to do list organized,
Good way to bnb organize your tasks and projects,
"Wonderful app, helps me get things done!!",
"Very useful, versatile app.",
"Works great, syncs with PC and online versions well",
Huge fan of todoist. Brilliant app,
Top of the class in the To Do game.,
Google calendar integration is the killer feature for me,
"The best to-do app I've come across, and I've tested a lot of them! It 
contains all the features you'd want: projects, labels, priorities, 
reminders etc. Thanks developers!",
It's a very useful great app😀,
"Very helpful, particularly the reschedule settings",
Simple but advanced with the API. Perfect.,
Definitely recommended. Even the free version is useful.,
Best collaborating to do list there is,
Favourite to do app of all time,
Easy and helpful for organizing my personal life.,
"easy to use, and the free edition is enough for me",
It can sync with google calendar!,
Great app. Love the features,
Keep up the good work.,
This is what I was looking for to organize my many paper lists.,
Love this app!,
Very usefull app.,
"Good, simple app",
Simple and easy to navigate.,
"Highly productivity, Excellent",
This is the BEST!,
Excellent Tool!,
Paid for premium. 100% worth it.,
Amazing. Very motivating.,
Best todo app ever,

"płacę i korzystam, jestem zadowolony. nie muszę niczego kopiować, 
przenosić, bo ta appka jest chyba na wszystkie platformy świata. wg mnie 
bez większych wad",
Perfecto,
"This app helps keep me organized and on top of things. The only thing I 
wish I could change is how it handles overdo tasks that are supposed to be 
performed everyday. If I forget to mark it off as done on Monday, then on 
Tuesday it says it's overdo. If I then mark it as done, it disappears 
entirely, instead of having another one for Tuesday. That's very minor, and 
probably won't even affect most people. It's just the one small thing I 
wish I could adjust.",
"Great app for getting the important stuff done. Very intuitive; no buttons 
or tabs you just type what, when and how frequently you want to do 
something and it formats it. I also like the simple prioritising and 
project labelling. And the app also helps you prospone and find gaps in 
your schedule so you're never cramming too much stuff into a day like most 
of the apps encourage you to do. Good simple, and a big stress relief.",
"Todoist is a good companion for planning with intelligent rescheduling 
features and an api that connects it to other apps I use such as mail. It 
uses categories and hasthtags and let's you give a priority. In any case, I 
am not yet convinced with this or any task scheduling programme. I lack a 
global vision of what's to ne done and the effort to puyt in it. Also the 
subtasks are not user friendly to create.",
"This app has honestly changed my life. I've been using it for nearly a year 
now and it has helped me to organise my life and become much more 
productive. I used to suffer from stress and anxiety because of my work, 
but knowing that all my tasks are organised in this app has been a weight 
off. The pro version is not super different to the normal one, but there 
are a couple of useful things in there like linking to google calendar. My 
favourite app",
"I have ADHD and this helps let me see what I have to do as a manager 
everyday. Not to mention I use it for other tasks like calendar reminder 
and even a few items to pick up from the grocery store on my way home. It 
works awesome, if you want to keep on task use it. It's amazing. I use the 
widget on my home screen so I never forget what's next on my list.",
"This is very helpful and I like having access to it on multiple interfaces. 
My only issue is that it had trouble as an add in on my Outlook because I 
unfortunately have Windows 10 but my coworkers are able to use it and it's 
super helpful to set emails as tasks and see it integrated with your 
calendar. I did integrate it into my Google calendar and use the desktop 
app instead of being in my Outlook. Highly recommend!",
"It's no overstatement to say that Todoist has reshaped my life. Along with 
the GTD time management system, it has enabled me to organize the myriad 
tasks that used to float around my head and in miscellaneous lists into one 
beautiful, easily searchable, customizable, multi-platform app. This app 
will get you hooked on accomplishing tasks.",
"I don't know what it is about todoist that makes my to do list so simple 
and intuitive to tackle, but out of all the apps I've tried, it's the only 
one that doesn't feel like one more thing to do. I love the scheduling and 
rescheduling feature, as well as being able to group tasks by projects, one 
of which I'm sharing with a colleague. Also the smart detection of projects 
and due dates is superb",
"It's a great app. However I do wish that setting up recurring tasks was a 
bit more intuitive; as far as I can tell, the only way to create a 
recurring task is to write ""every Thursday"" or ""every other day"" in the Due 
category, which is cool, but I would like to see a clickable option on task 
creation to make this easier",
"I've been using this app for over two years now (or 3-4? I've lost count). 
It's easily the best to do list app I've used: it's simple but powerful, 
and flexible but intuitive. Entering tasks in natural language is 
brilliant, and AI scheduling actually makes it easier to not be overwhelmed 
when you eventually neglect your todo list. Thank you for making what is 
undoubtedly the most used app on my phone and probably the most influential 
one in my life!",
"it has almost everything i need from a todo list!! i am not a big fan of 
reminders，because if you cant do it, you cant do it even if the reminder 
shows up like 1 million times. 1. streak record keeps me motivative, I 
believe if I can keep the streak going on, my life will be different and I 
will become a better me 2. no more tidius date and time inputs, you can do 
""reading daily"" boom! the task becomes a daily task, the app is smart 
enough to capture phrases related to time and date what can be improved? if 
I were to build my to-do list, I would use cardview, each task is a card, 
and I can put a emoji or a picture on the card to make it more attractive, 
it will better motivates me to finish the task and makes the task looks 
more friendly. and I am planning to build an app like that, so watch out! :)",
"After six months of researching of the to-do app I decided to use todoist 
and so far I am happy with it. Still learning though. The most important 
feature for me is a solid backup as I already have bad experience with 
others cloud app who lost my data forever.",
"I love this app. The free version is so good and gives you plenty of 
features. But I use this app every single day and find it so useful that I 
wanted to get the premium version. The premium version isn't 100% 
necessary, but it gave me some extra festures that I find very useful and 
make the experience just that little bit better.",
"Very useful organizing tool for business and personal use. I can share 
projects, update tasks, comment, coordinate with others, and have reminders 
as needed. Keeps me super organized and on top of things- people don't 
realize how naturally scattered I am because I use this system and they 
just see how on-top-of things I am!",
"I love this app the most. It deserves 9/5 stars. I had to change my rating from 4 to 5 star. The more I use this app, the more I love it. The premium version is totally worth it. You have to use the web version to understand how effective it is having this app. When you try it, make it your home page when you start your browser. Learn the shortcuts as they will help you add tasks faster during meetings. Learn to use projects and labels based on your style. Try the premium version and you may be amazed. It's not perfect and it looks too simple but the power in organizing your clutter of tasks will be easy by giving it due dates and viewing according to dates and also by using special filters. Also watch youtube videos of other users because although it's easy to use from the get-go, you get more most out of it if you learn advanced features.    I truly love the app and have just upgraded to premium. My concern is that  there has been a feature request by other users posted over a year ago.  This is one feature that can make them deserve 7 stars from me. The feature  is to see a patent task path for each sub task. I truly wish they can  implement this sooner.",
"Overcomplicated. It doesn't let you do basic things like bulk rescheduling 
multiple tasks. Basic timed reminders are behind a monthly billed pay wall. 
I'll stick with Google Keep, thanks.",
"Todoist is the first app that has had a profound positive effect on my 
life. The only other I could say has done the same for me would be Spotify. 
So yeah, it's awesome and worth every penny.",
"I love the widget, it does everything I need it to. The only thing I don't 
like about todoist is that a lot of features are premium. But it still does 
almost everything I need for free.",
"I flipping love todoist. when picking a to-do list app years ago I reviewed 
everything available and this was the best then and it still is. make sure 
you learn about its powerful recurrence rules, they're my fave.",
"The app is good, one improvement required is for subtasks you have to 
select parent task. There should be option to go to task, click +sign or 
some other icon to create subtasks below it. Because when we are in a task 
we remember to create subtasks. Finding parent task after creating task is 
hassle",
"Todoist makes me more effective. I track here everything, starting from 
buying groceries to whole long term projects. I practice ""getting things 
done"" as well. These two are f***ing megacombo for life success.",
"Great app. Very close to being perfect, but a number of small things bring 
it down slightly.",
"Fantastic app. Simple and easy to use, yet packed with helpful features. 
Well organized and the unpaid version isn't full of annoying ads, though 
it's clear the paid version has even more helpful features. Integrates with 
google calendar. Very good app!",
"Great app to keep my lists in one place. I think most of the other things I 
would like the app to do are part of the premium service, but I haven't 
paid for that. Even so, basic app is great.",
"Awesome app! This has lots of features I haven't used yet, but it's basic 
task management is awesome. I can easily rebalance my work load and see 
what's coming up.",
"I use Todoist so I can use my Google home to add things to my to do list. 
Love how easy it is, and I rely in the mobile app heavily. A+",
"This app is too efficient I think sometimes 😂 So far I've had a good 
experience with it. I still don't understand what karma means but it's 
alright.",
"I enjoy using this app as it gives me a clear, organized visual representation of the things I need to get done. I love getting to the end of the day and being able to check off a huge list of things.",
"I find it very helpful to have a convenient place to record, categorize, 
and prioritize tasks that come to mind throughout the day... Certainly 
removes the burden of needing to remember everything...",
"Once i got used to using this app I can't do without it. It's great. Not 
had a problem",
"Changed my life, once I learned how to manage my time. When this app is 
combined with effective principles for time management it becomes a 
powerful part of your daily workflow!",
"The perfect to-do list to organize my somewhat messy life. One major thing 
is how fast the making of a task is, both on the phone and wear OS.",
"Best to-do list I've ever used. Syncs with Google Calender which is super 
useful. Lots of ways to organize your lists.",
"Love this App early on. Went with premium love how it integrates with so 
many platforms. Will take time to use it like a pro and to its full 
potential, but worth it.",
"Loved this app Though I wish the tasks didnt disappear but just got check 
marks on the side. It's nice to reflect on the day's accomplishments.",
"Need app to enter jobs & how often to be done. App would spread jobs out on 
a calendar so things dont get crammed into one day or weekend",
"Not bad for anyone who wants to outline general tasks, as well as schedule 
things. Probably the best start for most trying to get into proper 
scheduling",
"Easy to use. I wish there was a widget that simply showed a number of tasks 
to complete without having to open the app. The existing widget takes too 
much space.",
"Paid for premium as needed the notes, and at £27 per year, not exactly 
expensive. Great app.",
"Latest updates broke the widget which was how I primarily used the app. I 
only went in to the app to take detailed notes and used the widget to 
sketch an idea or check something off quickly. Please fix the widget!",
"Its really excellent. I have been using it for a few years for both home 
and work. Well worth paying the premium cost!",
"This is the best app I've tried for keeping track of tasks. I love that it 
syncs across devices and web browsers. It is extremely user friendly. The 
reminders are great. I do have the premium membership but think it is worth 
it. I use todoist daily! It is interesting to look at the ""productivity"" 
stats. I highly recommend installing the Outlook plug in to easily add 
email tasks to the app.",
"Perfect app. Use it to organize all my chores and tasks. If synched with a 
calendar app it's an easier way to put in appointments and dates.",
"Works great to keep me on track for work tasks, grocery lists that my 
husband and I can both add to, and reminders for tasks/chores. I use it 
everyday.",
"Great that I can access both on my phone and laptop. Helps to jot down the 
things I have to do before I forget.",
"5 items isn't much for the free version, but the app works very nicely.",
"Best task manager/To Do list out there. App works perfectly, and so does 
the service in general. Easiest 5 star review I've given",
"Great app that helps me to organize myself on daily basis. It makes my life 
easier and I highly recommend it!",
"I'm an academic researcher and this app was the first to FINALLY bring me 
away from pen and notebook. It's EXACTLY what I've been searching for. 
Thank you!",
"Love the app! Was totally wasting my time with other todo apps. Best best

"I am loving this app, helps me get things done and smash my goals, good.",
"it almost had me converted from Wunderlist.. can't sort by create date 
newest first.. something so simple and still not available from what I read 
on the forums.. FAIL by ux team.. switching back",
"After a long time I found this excellent app. Wish had found it earlier. 
Download it today",
"It's a great app which reminds me of what I'm supposed to do throughout the 
day, although one recommendation I'd like to make a recommendation- it 
keeps spamming my mail with the tasks even though I get it separately on 
the phone taskbar.",
"I hate clicking somewhere deleting my tasks two times occured, it is a bad 
user experience, adjust it please.",
"Nice and simple but badly needs to be able to remember the sort order you 
specify.",
"Makes life super easy when you're busy and super analytical like me and you 
need a gameplay for each day/week. Better than all other apps I've used so 
far.",
"Easy to use and a great way to store those little things that would nag at 
you.",
"It might seem like a small thing but the ability to add transparency to the 
widget background would get it another star from me!",
"4 stars, just because no advanced analytics are present. Otherwise awesome 
in every regard!",
"Great todo tool for multiple platforms (using MacBook, other iOS devices, 
and an Android phone)",
"It helps me organize my tasks daily. As well as categorize each by priority 
and subject. Very helpful.",
"I liked using it but it really needs a snooze or on-hold feature for 
reoccurring scheduled tasks and projects.",
You shouldn't have to pay for time reminders but otherwise it's a good app,
"Good app for arranging my fast-paced day and priorities for my freelance 
projects. Thinking seriously to buy.",
"It automatically syncs on Android. On Windows I have to manually select 
sync, but it does work.",
"I have used Todoist for years and love it! I love that I can use it for 
work, home, travel, whatever needs listing! The app just takes the whole 
experience to a new and even better level!",
This app is bar none the best to do list out there,
"The best todo app right now! Very powerful, clean, fast and smart. You 
won`t regret it!",
"I love the 7 day to do list view because it allows me to see everything 
that's coming up and easily plan ahead. It's easy to add tasks way in 
advance too by just typing in the day you want to assign the task instead 
of searching for the date on a calendar - for example I can just type 
""tomororw meal prep"" or ""Saturday do laundry"" and the tasks will 
immediately float to the assigned day. The app is intuitive, nicely 
designed, and helps me effectively set personal deadlines.",
"This is a good task reminder app. I have enjoyed using it and would 
recommend using it for habit change",

motivator!",

my work email to help me stay on task",
U must consider add a complete week schedule planner,

"É fácil de usar, especialmente por utilizar linguagem natural. Permite 
agendar tarefas que são recorrentes, como por exemplo, uma reunião que 
sempre acontece na primeira sexta-feira do mês.",
"Very helpful. The only thing I can think that could make it better (for 
paid subscription) is ""dependencies"" - tasks that show up only once another 
one has been completed. But it's really useful already. I've tried several 
similar services, and this is the only one I find I'm actually using daily.",
"Could have been a great app. Unfortunately, it suffers from a subscription 
based model. I'd have gladly paid $35 as a one off to unlock a few things, 
but I'm not going to go for a subscription based service on what is 
essentially a shopping list app. Free version is too limited for any actual 
productivity.",
"The app is brilliant, I am very heavily reliant on Google calender so I 
love the integration. I have one suggestion though...as with reminders in 
Google calender, once marked as ""done"" they move to the top of the calender 
out of the way with a strike through. Could you mimic the functionality 
across Google calender when you mark a task as complete in Todoist.",
"This app has really helped me. I'm taking care of my elderly mother who has 
dementia, and I was overwhelmed by all the doctor appointments and other 
things I have to keep track of in her life. Todoist helps me with 
scheduling and reminders and notes on what needs to be followed up on. 
Super easy to use too!",
"This works the way that my mind does and has allowed me to list my to-dos 
somewhere I can't lose them! Between this and my calendar app, I'm feeling 
a lot more organized than I have in a long time.",
"First time I've managed to move from paper to digital successfully for task 
management. Still exploring features but finding it very intuitive.",
"I like the app but my Karma levels don't update. I don't know why but it 
hasn't been updating for the past 2 days but it continues to put in daily 
averages. Would like to see frequent updates with your karma levels maybe 
everytime you check them.",
"A good app to organize your life. to bad most of the best features are 
behind a pay wall. I still recommend the free version to get a feel for it.",
"Amazing app! Love that it has a Chrome extension and web option that sync. 
Took one star off for a very clumsy interface with Google Home that tends 
to be more of a time-waste than time-saver. Please work on that so I can 
give all 5 stars!",
"Pretty good. Some thing are not quite as intuitive as I think they should 
be.",
"Keeps me super organized. The daily reminders ensure I'm on top of my tasks 
no matter how busy my schedule!",
"I love the fact that I see tasks that are overdue. It is a constant 
reminder of what I need to accomplish before moving to the next task. I 
absolutely love this app.",
"Great app, but the 'try premium' messages are not so great. Maybe if it was 
a one time purchase.",
"Really helps to organize and break down bigger tasks into small and 
manageable tasks.",
"Prettymuch what I was wishing to have for work. I knew there had to be an 
app to do what I needed for work. I use free option.",
"Great app, really helps me keep track of tasks.",
"I just recommend this app, great help for my job of freelance",
"Really good app! Helps me stay up-to-date with all my important tasks. 
Clean, efficient, and sleek.",
Wonderful app. for organization and taking down notes,
"Great app which is simple on the surface, but has deep and powerful features",
It does exactly what I want it to be! Awesome app!,
"Great, multi platform is excellent.",
Good tool for general to-do's,
It definitely helps keep track of what needs to be done,
Suggested by a friend. Very helpful and easy to use. Would recommend,
Very clear and concise management of you todo list.,
Great way to keep organized and to delegate.,
Excellent app for keeping track of tasks and goals,
Amazing. Love the indent style hierarchy.,
Simple and easy to use. Excellent. Thanks,
This app increase my productivity,
It's really good i like it,
It's good and easy to use,
Awesome super smart app.,
Nice.... But in free version we don't get much features...,
Very useful App.,
I love this app....I need it❤❤❤❤,
Awesome app with GCal sync,
Quick fluid and easy to use,
Keeps me on task,
Good app,
Super productive,
Love it,
goo one..,
"I love being able to sync with Google & Android devices. I believe the 
price of around thirty dollars for the premium features are a great deal. 
Plus I don't feel sleasy for going the affordable route. Lastly, I really 
like being able to take my personal tasks away from my main calendar. Doing 
this helps me stay on track with family events, the more important things 
in life besides my goals.",
"I don't normally review apparently but I felt like this one deserved a 
review. Being a forgetful person, putting my to-do's in this app really 
helps me to plan out what I need to do. I also like (while seemingly 
simple) that it shows you to-do's on a day by day basis which really helps 
your to-do's not seem overly burdensome. Plus I love how I can add to-do's 
from my watch when I'm not too close to my phone. The convienence really 
helps and this app has helped me to stay on top of my to-do's. Thanks 
Todoist!!",
"Time is what nobody has and this app just gives us some, instead of taking 
like the others. I just love this app and have been advertising it for a 
lot of people (friends and coworkers) since I started using it.. Simply 
because it is very intuitive for me and very useful for the type of needs I 
was already having for years. With all of this, a lot of people around me 
just started improving their lives.. Even those who don't like apps, are 
nowadays grabbing the mobile phone to use Todoist and doesn't meter where. 
😉",
"It WAS a great app. Now that notifications have been removed from the free 
version, this app is basically useless for me. To require a subscription to 
get a feature that was previously free is despicable. The worst part is 
that there wasn't any warning given. I was left wondering why I wasn't 
getting notifications anymore.",
"I suppose that if what you want is a full-featured to-do list application  with lots of options and capabilities, this would be a good app. But for me  it's overly complicated.  After posting the above,  the developer sent an email to me asking for me to let you know what I found overly complicated, with no indication as to how I could send the message.  I did the only thing I knew how to do and that was to edit this review.  So here are my additional comments about what I found to be overly complicated.    For instance, I couldn't figure out how to have entries without deadlines.  So I was constantly getting overdue task notices sent to my email in-box.  I wasn't interested in that.  So I wanted to figure out how to turn off the email notices, and couldn't figure that out.  So I then tried to figure out how to lengthen the deadlines.  When I clicked on something, I think it was Remove Deadlines, or something like that, all of my tasks disappeared.  I'm sure that with enough time and effort I could have figured all of this out.  But I did put a nominal amount of time into it.  I did not see that methods to change the configuration were intuitive so deleted the app from my phone.",
"I will happily give a higher star review when I am replied to by customer 
service. They seemed to have forgotten about me which is bad customer 
service. I installed Todoist and the 2 way sync with Google calendar isn't 
integrating entirely. Google calendar has everything of Todoist but nothing 
from Google Cal has integrated on to Todoist. I don't want to have to start 
over with it all (copy and paste everything to Todo) when it's not 
necessary. I sent in a help request got a reply a day later with him asking 
more questions, I replied right away, and have not heard back in 3 days. So 
currently I still have my old Tasks and Todoist while I've been waiting and 
I'm missing things because it's spread out this way. Customer support 
please help and follow through.",
"Wonderful Todo list app - I use it everyday. Great that you can sync across 
devices including windows 10!! One small feature request though - I use 
this for both personal and work lists. It would be fab to be able to filter 
the notifications I get on each device by label, so my personal phone only 
notifies me of things labelled ""personal"" etc. This would make it pretty 
much the perfect tool!",
"Software developer here, they've done so many things right. A bit of a 
learning curve to get the most out of it, but well worth the investment. 
For me it is like mixing the good parts of a ticketing system with a to do 
list. For paid version",
"Haven't used it enough for a full review I wish it had something like a 
running shopping list that didn't have to be attached to a specific day",
"I have been look for a single source of truth, a place that I can put all 
the things that I want/need to do. This app is very easy to use and is very 
powerful.",
"I don't like it. All of the useful things like reminders and more stuff 
like that all need the premium version to work. Its just like writing a to 
do list down on paper. You make it to be more productive but in the end, 
it's your option on rather you check it or not.",
"Best productivity app, hands down. Free version doesn't have limiting 
features unlike similar apps and premium is a very good price too.",
"The best part is the karma system. It promotes teamwork and that's a 
feature I haven't found anywhere before it's got everything that I've been 
looking for.",
"one of the best app i've ever use so far, best productivity app in the 
market. Simple and easy to use, it has premium upgrade but no worries, its 
worth to upgrade to premium for its price.",
"Great app , gets a bit complicated at first but then things get sorted , 
must try for people filled with ideas but less of action",
This app is great because is integrates with IFTTT.  So I can star emails in Gmail and it automatically goes to my Todoist app.  I love the Karma points too. makes it more fun to get stuff done.,
"It is a great app to organise your time. It is well built and easy to 
understand. I would have never thought I needed one... but now I could not 
stay without it",
"I really love this app. I would give it 5 stars but I think setting up the 
times for tasks and reminders isn't as clean as it could be (just feels a 
tad cumbersome) but not enough to turn me off from using it. Love that it 
syncs with my Google calendar",
"This is literally the only to-do so I've ever find that works for me. The 
integrating with Google calendar makes it even easier to use - It helps me 
to visualise the use of my time & you can juggle tasks around on the fly. 
5*, todoist, keep up the good work!",
"Simple, and minimalistic. I really like the workflow and flexibility of the app. It was used to be my primary task manager but decided to move on due to price rise. Would love to get back if price went back to it used to be.",
"Wunderlist hasn't worked well in a long time so I finally made the switch 
and this app is amazing! Great replacement.",
"Great product. I use app every day and have for over a year. Works as 
advertised. Two major feature requests: A Linux command line interface and 
task time tracking. For the later, they have integration with toggl, but 
would be better to have something native.",
"Handy app to keep track of tasks, but not sure what the ""Karma"" rating is 
for except to make fun of me.",
"Great stuff, crucial since my son arrived (10 months now). Saving up 
pennies for the paid version after a generous free trial. Using it with 
Evernote. To be fair, it's reasonably priced. Well worth a go and the time 
investment to get up and running.",
"I use this to catch every task that comes to mind and love being able to 
assign them to a future date, less stress than adding more to today which 
is always so busy already, recurring tasks are easy to use and love the 
smart rescheduler, I wish history was a little easier to view so I could 
see when I last completed a reoccuring task so I know if it should have 
been done sooner because I make repeats too far apart sometimes",
"It's really good for making and following task, but I would just like to be 
able to buy one month of premium instead of a whole year.",
"Excellent productivity app with fantastic features I didn't know I needed 
till I started using them. 👍",
"Almost perfect! If only it knew what 'tonight' meant and I did not have to 
write 'today night'. You would imagine that it's an easy thing to fix.",
"I love todoist. It helps me arrange all tasks day-wise, as per priority. 
The premium version gives reminders of tasks for which I need one. I 
thought that I wouldn't need reminders much and that the free version would 
be enough. But after trying the premium version as a free trial, I feel 
compelled to get the premium version. Great job todoist!",
"Having tried every project/task management platform under the sun, for 
managing my own personal life and work tasks, this delivers the most 
effective, simple and focused tool there is.",
"Brilliant! You can set recurring tasks and it will remind you however often 
you want, and you can set tasks for the future and it will remind you then. 
It really does help you to stop thinking about things as much.",
"Works very good. The usage could probably be simplified around the notes 
feature for tasks. Update: The notes feature could be improved by using 
some shading to differentiate between different notes. Furthermore, a 
direct edit button would also be handy.",
"Though the app is good. Why will i choose to spend 3000 inr just for 
reminders when there are plenty of free aps out there to make me remind 
tasks.",
"Some to do lists are too simple, some to-do lists are too complex. This 
feels like a good balance of simplicity and options.",
"Everything is fine but 30USD a year just for getting notifications doesn't 
make sense to me. I would have given it a 5 star if only the free version 
had at least simple notifications",
"Great app, really useful but i would say you have to immerse yourself into 
it to get the most from it.",
The last update is a win! The new karma & productivity interface are top notch! Keep improving this already awesome app for eventually reaching the perfection! Update: Love the new black theme! This thing is beautiful! Keep it up!,
"Helps me to keep my day organized and love the Google calendar integration. 
Would love be able to time block",
Helps me to remember stuff I regularly would forget without it.,
"Reminders only available in premium version. Don't you feel you have to be 
competitive with all the other free apps out there? I'm prepared to pay but 
for more",
"It's a great app! Just take the time to set up different to-do lists, 
called projects, set your priorities and set your due dates if applicable 
and the app does the rest!",
"Great for basic tasks. Can create projects and timelines. No improvements 
necessary",
"This app has been exactly what I needed to keep my personal and work tasks 
organized.",
"Why limit the Karma trend data to one week span? Minor point I guess. 
Otherwise, solid app once you get into the groove of it",
"Amazing productivity app from a responsible and inspiring company. Using it 
everyday!",
Amazing. Totally increased my productivity. You need this app!,
"Great app for what it is. Helps me stay organised, honestly a life-saver!",
"So fulfilling to be able to quickly organize my life & see progress as I 
complete each task. Thanks!",
Beautifully made...was used to command line todo lists till i found this...keep up the great work,
"Great app. Just what i needed to track and improve my effectiveness at 
completing my goals!",
Very nice but they want a ton of money for the paid features.,
"I haven't had the need for premium, it works for exactly what I need. :)",
This is the best app for Todo which I have used till now.,
"A great productivity tool for getting focused and tracking progress through 
projects.",
"Nice. Not perfect, but still it's best for me for now.",
I really like the simplicity of this app. Very easy and intuitive to use.,
"syncing google calendar is best. We can assign how long does a task take by 
syncing with this.",
So far so good trying to get more organized,
Great App. Makes organizing work easy and compliments vision boards.,
Doesn't sync with office 365 . Disappointed,
Very well structured for you to create your own structure for how you work.,
Todoist one related of my life. Great!,
"Simple and effective. I am a teacher and I recommend this app to my 
students.",
Good app to keep my busy days on track.,
"Excellent app! Clean, minimalistic, and very easy to use!",
"No agradó primera experiencia. Pocos colores en usuario básico, color rojo 
estresa.",
"Solid design, simple. Great stuff. Still the best on the market.",
Great app but it's free version is way too basic,
Calendar synchronisation esp. with time slots is a great feature,
It really helped me organise my life!,
Should be able to see completed task in the list,
Does what it says on the tin - really well.,
Made me much more productive!,
It is very helpful in keeping track of issues,
Easy to catch-up your agenda,
Good app. sends reminders and mail,
Easy to use for someone with such a poor memory. Thanks,
"Easy to use, beautiful design.",
A very useful app that is simple to use,
"Surprisingly great stuff, thank you",
Essential to focus on and manage my life !,
Love it. Helps me organise my life.,
Makes keeping track of family tasks easier.,
I have not seen other features because im am using free version,
It's simply a great app!,
Helps you get organised quickly,
Great product for list and time mngmnt,
I love its elegant design,
Nicely helps me stay organized,
Great app to keep track of ToDos,
It is a helpful app for my job. Thanks,
Reminders is a premium feature. Tick tick is better,
Does what a ToDo app should do,
Works well across all my devices.,
The widget keeps forgetting my preferred view,
It's a little too complex.,
"Очень удобно планировать свое время - в приложении нет никаких лишних, 
утяжеляющих функций",
Simple and just deep enough.,
Best app to stay on track.,
Love it. Flexible and easy to use.,
"Good, easy to use App.",
"I keep losing my filter. Every once in a while the app will not show any 
tasks until I set a filter",
"Free, helpful, easy to use",
Great app! Very helpful!,
This will install AdSense targeted ads on your device.,
"This is a cheating apps.... don't downlaod... @ Developer: Why u all r 
cheat with general peoples?????",
I just love it!!! Greetings from Brazil!!!,
It's been good so far 👍🏼,
It's very handy,
"Great, thanks.",
Changed my life tbh,
Good to do list app,
Great for organizing your life,
This is such a nice app,
Able to put defult on inbox,
"Simple, flexible",
Why is there a limit of 200 active projects max?,
Helps alot,
Keeps everyone in balance,
Essential productivity application,
Awesome app,
The best,
Awesome app,
Good one,
Love it,
good,
Like it so far,
It have to improve,
It's the 🔌,
"Todoist is a great tool to sort your to do list by projects, due date and 
priority while having a clean look that can be used during work time. 
However, at least as a premium function, I am missing two things. 1. One is 
to show some tasks only after a prior necessary task was fulfilled instead 
of showing all at once making the list overwhelming. 2. The other is a dark 
widget theme with dark background and white font color. I have everything 
set to dark, but the todoist list widget on my phone's desktop shines 
blindingly white.",
"The multiple ways of organizing and tracking your Todo lists makes 
everything easy. I am able to use the ""Getting Things Done"" method, 
pioneered by David Allen, with ease. Can't say enough good things about 
this product.",
"Able to set up complex subcategories which helps dividing huge assigments 
into less scary subtasks. Hope they separate plan-to-work-on-it date and 
deadline so that we could prioritize our task based on time constraint more 
easily.",
"Love it! I wish the task bars weren't so big I don't like to scroll to see 
all of my goals but that's me nit picking. One other tool I'd like to see 
is a calendar so I can click a day in the past and see all of the things I 
did that day. Again, me being extra. I love it! Best app I've tried and 
I've tried a lot of apps!",
"I was a bit reluctant about getting the paid version of this app. Now that 
I have it, I can't believe I waited! I am now LIVING out of this app. It's 
the one I use for organizing my days, prioritizing what to do first, 
second, third, etc. But the biggest critierion I use for judging an app is 
""Does it help me?"". And in the case of Todoist, the answer is YES. My days 
are more productive, I'm getting more done, and it keeps me motivated. 
Probably the best app I've ever purchased. And it's awesome that I can 
switch between my PC, iPad, and Android phone - all seemlessly. Just get 
it. :-)",
"It took me a while to set it up for myself, but I love using it. I find it 
highly motivating. Addicting almost to get those Karma points. The app 
works really well for GTD.",
"For the features it provides its a fairly solid app. There are a couple 
things i wish you didn't have to pay for, but I guess thats what premium 
for.",
"No subtasks but amazing interface. The desktop is very sleek and the mobile 
gives all the functionality. I still prefer using it on PC",
"This is helpful as a reminder for homework due dates. Awareness and 
deadlines are what help me do my tasks. For me at least its easier to use 
if i think about it like a homework app, that way it stays organized.",
"Long time Google Tasks user, installed todoist because of the hype. Logged 
in using my Gmail account. No tasks imported? I guess it's a good app for 
people who need a complex task manager, but I'ma stick with free Google 
Tasks. KISS",
"super useful and easy to use. I use this app to keep track of my 
assignments for school and it's an easy transfer from my laptop and phone. 
love the layout- very clean and organized! also able to plan 7 days ahead 
which is great for planning ahead on what needs to be done when. overall 
would definitely recommend this app!",
"This is for the free version. It's pretty good; the interface is nice and 
it has decent functionality. But reminders are not included.",
"You can be super organized through the most simple way possible, and also 
add the information you need by simply typing a like 'do that (tomorrow 
afternoon)'. The free version does not do many things though.",
"It's really helping me to sort all my work stuff out. Been using it for a 
week and I have nothing but good things to say so far.",
"The more you learn it the more powerful it gets. Well thought out app, 
strong integrations. I'm a convert after many years with Any.Do",
"Good app but majority of the features you would use you have to pay. Moving 
to the app next door where the basic stuff is free.",
"I have the free version and it's all I need. I'm sure there are more 
complete todo apps out there but if you're kind of a minimalist and don't 
need crazy functionalities, this one is a go to. I recommend !",
"Works well for what it is, but it is límited in customisation. After many 
years, it still does not have a manual sort for filtered lists. I use 
Dynalist for that now and save Todoist for minor tasks.",
"Is right up there with the best app I have used. It's definitely an app I 
can't do without both personally but more so in business as I am an 
absolute disaster at organisation. Todoist u rock!!!!",
Great to do app. Part of my daily routine. Wouldnt be organised without it,
"I've tried a few To-Do lists, but todist is the first one that I find I use 
consistently, which is the real trick with a To-Do app. The interface is 
very intuitive, but robust. I love being able to use Google Assistant to 
add events, and I love the email and Google Calendar calendar integration. 
I am thrilled!",
"I wish I could check something off that I did but forgot to check it off. 
But understand why it is the way it is.",
"This app sucks. Every mildly useful feature is premium and it's extremely 
unintuitive. I can't figure out how to view my history or setup recurring 
todos. Uninstalled. Why was this editor's choice?",
"Great for small teams and projects, the natural speech recognition could 
use some improvement.",
"I use Todoist every day, both the app and the website. I love it!",
This is the best To-Do app I ever used.,
Very nice app. This goes perfectly with my Full Focus Planner,
My go-to to do list/productivity/time management application,
Hide premium features a little better,
It has all the features I was looking for...worth the premium upgrade.,
This app really helped me he more organized.,
The best todo list app. Period. No competition.,
This made me so productive.,
I like it coz its actually organized!,
Tried just about every todo app but keep coming back to Todoist.,
Keep my shopping list on it. Its great,
It does everything I need it to do.,
Nice...I love how all my devices sync up,
Wish there was notes I can make per task,
Simple app works well.,
"Clean, easy to use.",
Great app! Makes my life :),
Really helpful!,
Nice app to time management,
Nice and interesting app,
Love the simplicity of the app,
By far the best,
Great.,
Very good,
Very handy,
App is good,
Brilliant app,
Great app,
Great,
"This app is fantastic. It's a task management system that doesn't go 
overboard like Jira. Collaboration is super easy and gives a great view 
over a large project like moving house. There was a bug with sharing 
projects initially but that got resolved pretty fast. My only problem with 
the app is making things sub tasks. The interaction where you hold a task 
and drag it up or down to rank it is useful but it's so sensitive to 
left/right movement you accidentally make things sub tasks all the time. If 
I had to drag a task further to the left or right that'd be great.",
The phone app is good but the Wear OS app is pretty much useless. You can't see your to-do list on your smartwatch. You'll get 5 star the day I can have my Alexa shopping list on my wrist.  Edit: ready to 5 star the hell out of your app as soon as it is released on wear OS. +1 star for replying nicely to my comment. Welcome to my personal list of awesome devs who take time to answer comments in a constructive way. I'd be happy to beta test the Wear OS app,
"Updating my feedback. Its still the best/logical ToDo App out there. 
Unclutered, straight forward, lots of sensible extras, but the WearOS App 
is dragging far behind. Its time to put more functionality in it where you 
can see at least the 7 Day outlook, be able to check off things, and of 
course continue to add as is the only thing you can do now. Smart watches 
are flooding the market, and Dev's need to step up the pace.",
"The app is so close to perfect, of only you could get the productivity 
chart without going to premium. Or if it just let you see what you'd done 
that day, as it removes completed tasks. The other premium content, I can 
take or leave, but I need to see what I've accomplished as part of my 
therapy. If that part wasn't behind the paywall I would have been ecstatic. 
It seems such an integral part, so I'm confused as to why it's locked away. 
Otherwise, this is a brilliant app.",
"No dark theme. Worse yet, this app does not work unless you are logged in 
and online. With your online registration info, Todoist will then send you 
junk email for the rest of your life, until you unsubscribe. In response to 
these last complaints, the developer says, ""The sign-up process takes 30 
seconds, then you can use the app offline and unsubscribe from any emails 
anytime."" Fair enough, I suppose, but I still don't find the app as 
practical as others out there, such as EPIM or BusinessCalendar2.",
"Updated my review after several years of using Todoist...from 4 stars to 5 stars after going premium.  I don't work for Todoist and was given no promotion. They didn't even ask me to write this review, and I have only written a few reviews. If I don;t like an app I just delete it, which I think most people do.   Started using Todoist after trying several others. There was a learning curve but not bad. Being all online is great. Still don't quite have the hang of getting all my tasks organized under their projects and labels.   I used the free version for a long time (years) and they never bugged me much about going with premium. I finally went premium after I decided I needed the extra features.  Doesn't seem to ever be down. I also attached it to my Chrome browser and have it on my android phone. Works great on all devices. Not buggy at all.  Having it on all my devices and the browser is essential to the core idea of getting tasks accomplished. I don't have time to log onto one device and work on my tasks. I need to be able to log on to any of my devices and add, delete and organize my tasks. Todoist does all this.  I have no negatives to say about this app.",
"This has helped me sleep better at night! There always seems to be a 
thought that pops into my head after I've finished working for the night, 
or when I'm out shopping. It's easy to add it to Todoist so I remember by 
the deadline of my choice. It's been great to plan my tasks out and with a 
bit more clarity and I get a sense of satisfaction when I can tick 
something off. After a few weeks of using it, I have been more productive 
than usual. That doesn't mean I've managed to complete every task every day 
but I've been able to organise each day to productive and if something 
comes up, it's easy to reorganise it.",
"After searching for a long time for a todo app that does exactly what I 
want, I finally found one. Simplicity with an underlying and accessible 
advanced feature set to let me do everything an task management and 
planning app should do. I have recommended this app to multiple people that 
have all been positive.",
"Being a productivity geek for almost a decade now, I can safely say that I 
have been through a LOT of task managers. And after using Todoist for 
nearly a half a year now, I can safely say that it is without a doubt, both 
the one that is best and outlasted the rest. THE NUMBER ONE KILLER FEATURE 
is the natural language due date input. I will never be able to use task 
managers any other way after this. Rich with all the features you might 
want, definitely well suited for power users, and an amazing rewards 
program for Premium and the sweetest customer service.",
"I'm giving this app 5 stars despite the fact I'm not going to use it again 
and I will tell you why. It is well designed, has really fantastic features 
like calendar sync and I could not point to anything wrong with it. I was 
trying it out, after using another a more visual to-do app however I just 
can't get used to not seeing all my tasks ordered on one page - this is no 
fault of todoist. And true to their word, I asked for the 30 day money back 
guarantee and they replied immediately and obliged. Great service! Thanks",
"Highly recommend for anyone who has tasks to complete. No one tool is 
perfect, but this comes really darn close, and few times have there been 
things that aren't possible in my system. I picked up this app while 
learning the GTD system, and it has seriously improved my happiness and 
stress. I now see tasks and actionable things that I can do instead of a 
dread of vauge projects. If you are going to be serious, premium is well 
worth it. Personally, I have a @waiting and @next_action tags as well as 
several location ones that help me look at exactly what the work I can do 
right now is. Comments are suprisingly useful, mostly for attaching PDFs. I 
don't have a ton of other apps to compare it too, but it runs incredibly 
smooth, useful, works across all my devices, and I feel like I owe them 
this review after all the good this app has brought me.",
"In project view I cannot hide completed tasks and my projects stay 
cluttered with completed tasks. I really want to like this app and have it 
become my primary tool for getting things done but this is a huge flaw for 
my use. If you think about a physical pen and paper todo list, there's 
something satisfying about crossing a line through the item or checking a 
once-blank box, that isn't there in this app. I want to feel like I can 
clearly see what I have left to do for the day. I would really appreciate 
if completing tasks made the task significantly different (strikethrough or 
making the text of completed tasks more transparent). I want to see that 
I've completed something (for the day). I think another fun addition for 
the programmers would be visually rewarding recurring tasks being completed 
with a little fireworks display or a little cute puppy or something next to 
the task. Please consider these additions to the app as it would really 
improve my life. I will still use this app but I would love for the app to 
respond more to my little successes each day. Thank you!",
"Good looking and easy to use. Practical features. Helps me stay organised 
studying and running my business. Love that it links to other apps on 
laptop ( though the link to gmail doesn't give you the specific message). 
Saves me loads of time and I can update on the run from my phone.",
"Tried a lot of task systems, this is certainly the winner.  Works great with GTD.  Also connects with Asana and other apps via Zapier for larger projects",
A well thought out app for keeping organized and on task. I like that I can make lists on the computer and view or update them on my phone.,
"Very well made. Easy to use. I would have liked being able to see details 
of archived items like date of creation and date of completion.",
"Hate being forced to signup only to find out that almost all features that 
this product is being advertised for are for premium subscription only. Not 
willing to pay 40$ a year to use it. Delete!",
"Works well with my various devices and has lots of options for organizing. 
I like the gCal integration, so I can see my hard commitments in with more 
flexible tasks.",
"I really like the simple layout of this app and the daily reminders and 
various other organizational options. Helps me remember those little things 
I think of when I'm out and about without paper 💕",
Love the app but they still have not resolved my issue that started after version 12. I have to keep rolling back to version 11.  The todoist team kept working on my issue and continued to stay in contact with me until corrected my problem. Yeah for the support!,
"Its a pretty good app.. notifies u for tasks that are remaining and also 
have schedule feature for projects and other stuff.",
"I love this app. Im on top of everything at work and personal life with 
ease. I only wish you could cut and paste or transfer tasks from project to 
project. Other than that small adjustment this was the best investment ive 
made in a while.",
"Would still like a bit more versatile/adaptive widget, but for all I use it for, it's a joyful interface and an all-in-all solid app.",
"Made it very easy and intuitive to embrace GTD, and build habits and tools 
to make me more effective and free up cognitive energy",
"Loved the app but on my recurring tasks (every 30th) it skipped the month 
of April. Had to recreate the task to include April. It's troublesome if it 
skipped another month.",
"I like this app, but every few months it erases all my scheduled notifications. Very frustrating when important tasks are missed because app lost reminder. Also frustrating to have to manually reconfigure all the notifications.",
"Saves paper and conveniently let's me write my to do lists on my phone. I'm 
managing my time better and planning ahead. Helps me remember stuff like to 
give the dog his pills too",
"By far the best to do/ task management app I've used for personal use. The 
free version allows for so many ways to organize, and the interface is 
clean and easy to use",
"Great little app to get tasks organised and planned. I really quickly found 
it invaluable and just paid for the full version.",
"Keeps me productive throughout the day and week! Just wish it had a 
calendar view of finished tasks. That'd be a cool addition.",
"Have just installed and it is literally taking forever for it to get 
started once clicking which email account to use. This is with only one 
other window open on phone and with full phone reception. At this stage not 
a very good first impression.",
"It's a great app. Awesome interface and easy to use. I am uninstalling it 
though, coz it does not have reminders in the free version. Wish it did, 
coz the pro version I can't afford right now.",
"I like the way I get a daily notice the next day of things I didn't get 
done today. Keeps me up on projects, bill payments and due dates. Great 
App!!",
"Awesome awesome awesome!! Loved this. Im using this daily to complete my 
tedious tasks and run errands.",
"Love it! I've stopped using my paper diary! Also perfect for jotting down 
thoughts.",
Great app and syncs well. Makes my days easier to run. Only down side is it doesn't have a Samsung App which means I can't use it on my watch.,
"Love it! Nice app for more short term todo stuff, I use it mainly for 
today/this week and it's great for that. Happily pay for premium.",
"Terrible. Couldnt even sign up! ""An unknown error occured"" didnt matter 
what I did always some unknown errors!!",
Love this app. I've used premium to implement my GTD flow and it's great. Actually for the first time I like a mobile interface more than I like a web one! Great job.,
"The app is all over very Good, but some basic feature like reminders is 
only available if you pay for premium . This feature is freely available in 
the compititive app of this app in "" To Do list by Splan Do "" . I am using 
this app by daily basis. So I just want to tell you that you must have to 
give this basic feature in free version user also, also doing this you can 
approach your users to buy premium. No doubt that the app is very good but 
basic functionality is the main reason to choose premium plan. Thank you.",
"I like it but I think setting up reminders is a kinda basic functionality 
to have only on the premium mode.",
"I like the simple user interface, its not too overwhelming when making a 
short list and prioritizing them.",
"Great app, but I do have a question, and would appreciate an answer by 
anyone. Does this app have support of computers, so that I can view and 
edit this from my computer?",
Excellent for managing my personal tasks and reminding me to do things.,
"Love it, bought the premium but now they've switched to subscription? How 
does that work for those of us who purchased it outright? Will rate again 
once this issue is resolved.",
"Very simple and easy, but the premium option is not necessary i think.",
Die hard GTD fan and this app let's me do pretty much everything.,
Great app! Love how it detects times and dates in my tasks.,
"The best app to boost your productivity and to know what you have done 
throughout the day.",
"Honestly, this is the most useful app on my phone after WhatsApp. Improved 
productivity brilliantly",
Great to organize my tasks during my work day.. Makes me feel the productivity🤗,
"I use the free version and I'm very satisfied with it. I'm likely to go to 
the premium version shortly.",
Great app if you're as forgetful as I am.,
"This app is helping me to maintain my productivity. There is nothing to 
complain about.",
I've tried a lot of to-do apps. Todoist is the clear winner here. Absolutely loving this app. 😍,
"Great app. Helps me keep on track and synces very well across multiple 
devices",
Love this app. So intuitive to use. It's been a pleasure to use daily,
"Its a good app for day to day. The icons on the phone aren't too obvious in 
illustrating what is what.",
Beautiful and intuitive UI. These people know what they're doing.,
Works great with Alexa Eco.  Wish I could send list by text message,
Very efficient reminder tool with sub tasks and related notes across different platforms.,
Absolutely exactly what I want for everyday and business task management,
"This is the best Todo app and the smart scheduling is one of the top notch 
features",
"Surely can improve and be more interactive with other apps but overall a 
great tool",
"Awesome GTD tools, been using for years and happy to keep using it.",
"Love it! Very helpful tool. Easy to learn and use, but also very powerful. Excellent and highly recommended.",
This is my go-to organizer for work and social calendars.,
"Good, but too expensive for the premium version.",
"Great app for productivity, as well as implementing the GTD methodology",
Very minimal and effective app. Worth your time and money,
Really helping me stay on top of my list,
This is very good tool to organize the working tasks,
A great way to implement GTD.,
Great interface and convenient to use! Highly recommend!,
Nice to have synergy with all thing Google,
Really helpful like my mini PA,
Great app to manage your daily tasks,
"Simple, effective, easy to use to-do list app",
Great app for organizing to-do lists,
Remembering of things via Gmail is very good,
Great app to remind me to do things,
Really love the adaptability and clean interface!,
This app keeps me on track!,
"Terrific ... Simple enough, yet complex enough ... A great app for listing 
and organizing!",
Meh costs too much money,
I think this app is helpful and user friendly.,
Seriously considering the payed version. Todoist is awesome,
Great help with everyday tasks and goals management.,
Very helpful and easy to use app,
Fantastic.....just the perfect blend of stuff that makes your day easy....great app guys...,
Muy buena app de tasks!,
Easy to use. Have all features I need. I recommend to try it...,
Very nice app to organise.,
It's a very nice app,
Excellent. Perfectly intelligent and simple.,
Finally I found a day to day planner that works for me!,
Useful to do list app!,
It's fine. good app,
It's great! 🎉,
Wonderful App!,
This app is amazing!,
Helpful for scheduling my life,
The best app ever,
Best app for notes and reminders,
How wonderful!!!!!,
Love!,
Great Apps.,

Does the basics well.,

Very user friendly,
Very streamlined and simple,
Simple and really nice,

Why do you need my email password?,
Does it's job.,

Amazing,
Perfect,
Useful,
Get. Stuff. Done.,
Gud one.  . .,
"I think it's great but wish comments and alerts were free features. It's kinda halfassed without those. Smooth interface and data entry for the most part. Needs an ""at some point in the near future"" date selection for stuff you know you have to do but don't know when you'll get to it yet.",
"In my opinion, they do not help you to solve your goals, but rather solve their own financial problems by peeling off the subscriber fee for the push notification option. (Which costs nothing at all - just a few strings of program code) Absurd!",
The best part is it works smoothly with the web version. One suggestion would be to make assigning a date simpler than now. I'm still learning. There's so much one can do. I use for daily tasks. I can check off things that I finished or reschedule to another date. I'm sure there's a way to specify tasks repeat or specify tasks from previous days.,
First review im actually ever done because this app deserves it. Really just keeping things organised in the app not just in my mind has helped me stay focused on my goals. And i have done so much more with this app in hand then ever before!.  Its unbelievable how easy it is to use. A tip: divide large tasks into smaller ones to get that task fullfilment dopamine hit :),
"Guys, i'm so excited about the new way to measure my progress. Instead of karma points now e have the nr of done tasks/the goal for the day.   Would appreciate to be able to add tasks with the in line adding option, from lables view. Not sure if you understand what i mean, bur i can explain if needed. Great job!",
"I would really like the ability to define an estimated time to complete each task, then to be able to sync those tasks to Google Calendar. If you didn't complete some, the app could then help you set it up for another day. To do lists are nice, but it's a pain to manually write up your day on the calendar. An app like this could be so powerful if it could help manage that. If it could see what's on your calendar already and work around that... If it could know what things could be done indoors vs outside and in what weather and during what hours, it could work around that... So many possibilities. I get a boost by managing my list, but I lose productivity when I have to react to the environment and schedule things and not get behind. It could even help you figure out how long it takes for you to do certain tasks and then suggest realistic amounts of time for you. These are features I would pay for!",
Great app that helps organise your work and home life. I found it's best used when combined with setting up the Getting Things Done (GTD) workflows.  Premium version is worth every penny.  🙂,
"I used a different product on Windows Phone, but this does just about everything that did and actually does a few things better. I did research about five different options, including the Microsoft option, but it did not have some task. That was a deal-breaker for me. This software handles subtasks flawlessly.",
Tried it few years ago and hated it. Now giving it another go - lots of things changed (for good) and I'm totally excited to see all the new features - 2 way sync with google calendar being my fav.,
"On point app for making to-do lists, a bit confusing interface, specially the task priority related ones. has a nice prediction system (the tasks deadlines are predicted based on what you've already got to do)",
"I'm very disappointed with the new design the app just got. I was really enjoying the app for the last year and have been using it everyday, but I'm not sure why they had to go and change the appearances. The karma total beside the name was much better. Why change what's already been good?",
Switched upon discovering Wunderlist was no longer being supported. I didn't think I was going to find a better GTD app but here we are. 10/10,
Amazing app for team managing and colaboraton. After 2 years of experience managing enormous administration could not imagine life without Todoist.,
"As always u have to pay for premium model but the basic package does the job for me.  Haven't tried any other apps to compare this against, but so far so good",
Super app even the free version. Great interface a few mins of playing about and it's easy to use with multiple features. My new favourite organisational app.,
Useful & intuitive. This app has made my days more organized that other apps can only dream of. This is easily one of the best apps in the smartphone world.,
By itself it's a very good app. Adding date and time stamped notes to tasks is very useful. The UI is great on my phone.  Using IFTTT I have connected Evernote to it and have all the completed tasks sent to Google Sheets. It also works well with Amazon echo where spoken tasks can be sent to the inbox or a shopping list.,
For anyone that likes to be organised this is the perfect app. When I have too much on my mind this is my go-to. Easy to use and categorise your tasks.,
Seems like an alright app from what I can tell but essential features are behind a paywall. No trial to see if you like it or even works. It's a yearly subscription to boot.   I'll just try a different app...,
This is a great app. I'm using Todoist Business. I just wish that there's an option to have a time line view of tasks for projects.,
Really helping me create a routine to complete all my goals. Love that I can have all my lists combined into one.,
"Somply the perfect app for the job. Great UI, variety of functions, unfortunately quite limited in the free version but imho still enough to use the app. Love the calendar support and the widget. Well done!",
"App is great, but reminders would be a great addition to the free version. There are enough other features for the paid version that people would still purchase it.",
Todoist is basically my productivity. I plan pretty much everything and it feels pretty satisfying to cross off tasks off the list. My favourite feature might be how fast it syncs between mobile and my computer.,
"So helpful for all sorts of projects. I use for agile working, team projects and my personal life. It's helped me be more productive.",
"Why on earth are todos in the widget so wide?? It takes so much space, much more then project headers on its own. I displayed all my projects in the widget and I see headers of projects with list of todos and each todo has redundat info (project name again in the bottom right of a todo). Why?? I wanna see as many todos as possible on my screen.",
This is an absurdly useful and feature stuffed To Do app. I was hesitant about paying for the full version at first but absolutely do not regret it now. Integrates well with Android Wear with a little bit of tweaking. Essential!,
"This is the first time I readily feel I can review an app with the first prompt after having used it for a few days. I can easily give the highest score, as I really believe this app is going to be a major reason why I'm going to be rich and/or famous a few years down the road. I consider going Premium just to pay these guys for doing what they do. Deep Work shines through.",
I have tried lots of todo apps over the years and Todoist is by far the best I've ever used. I love the new favourites feature!,
"Quick and intuitive, with extra depths if needed, such as native language processing. Highly recommend for helping to clarify tasks. Great 'to do' app.",
Ive been looking for an app like this for ages. Alot of list apps dont allow you to set dates and priority levels like this one does. And it's free.,
"Todoist is an excellent app. AND when used regularly it helps me more effective and efficient for the ""big stuff"" and all the little things that matter as well. Highly recommend...without any reservations. DSN",
"Intuitive and nice to use, perfect to do list. Unfortunately has a premium version that costs, but it is understood this is the cost for the lack of ads",
Couldn't do my job without this app and I don't even use its full potential.,
"Pros: syntax features due date, priority and repeating tasks. Cons: doesn't 
sync with Taco Chrome extension",
I've only been using this app for a week but I'm liking it. I downloaded the app mainly to use with Alexa but found the app was so much more than that. I'm a little disappointed with the interaction with Alexa but that may just be that I haven't worked that out very well yet.,
I love the ability to break tasks into smaller goals and set dates. And waking up to daily emails outlining what I need to get done is really helpful.,
"Fantastic app. Originally got it for the Mac, so I could keep track of stuff I had to do for work. But started using it on my phone and tablet when out and about. It's surprising (for me at least) how more productive it's made me. I love that I can add tasks on my phone than I can pick up and finish on the computer later, so I don't forget to do something.",
I've tried many todo list apps and this is by far the easiest to get on with. The integration with email is excellent and teams is great definitely recommend giving this a go,
"Best To do list app I've tried and I've tried a ton. Fast, reliable, flexible and easy to use. Syncs instantly to all my devices.",
I wish so much of what was great about this app didn't cost a monthly subscription fee but its still amazing.,
KINDLY MAKE THE TILE HEIGHT SMALLER. Great app. Perfectly blends time element with todo list while retaining the list format instead of a calendar decomposition,
"I absolutely love it, it's so practical and easy to use. In addition,  you can share tasks with others 😊",
this is one year for me using this application and it really helped me a lot ! it litteraly changed my way of thinking ^^ thanks a lot Todoist Team ! keep going...,
"Very simplistic, but effective design that allows you to assign tasks for dates months out in advance. Cute features like karma and streaks will work well for people with competetive tendencies.",
Love this straightforward app that helps me remember all the little things I need to get done for my family.,
I'ts an amazing app. It really got my productivity up. It really helps more than you think at first.,
"Can't do anything (AMOLED theme, reminders) without paying a massive sum which isn't even a one time expense. Rip off.",
"The best to do list and task manager. Simple for new users, but the API makes it possible for power users to do more.",
"Well designed, easy to use and integrates well with other services like Gmail. Well worth the money for the premium edition.",
Using this with the book Getting Things Done to simplify my life; great find!,
Easy to use and so useful. Also motivates me to actually complete my tasks. Big thumbs up to the developers.,
"This has become my Maverick! I'm thankful! I'd add simple features like a calendar view or cards like Trello, but I just love and ejoy this app.",
It feels faster now with the new update since they made some smart changes on the ui. Especially favorites.,
"Buttons to activate premium features TOO CLOSE to regular functions. I will 
NOT upgrade out of frustration alone.",
Best todo app ever. However the free version is a bit too restrictive.,
A simple yet effective app to make the most out of a day. I really liked the automatic sorting of tasks.,
Great app.  Very fast and easy to use.  Keep my tasks there and can even follow up different projects.,
Really easy to use but not sure what features it has - a walkthrough of how to use it would be amazing but otherwise it's fantastic!! Highly recommended!!,
This app keeps crashing on galaxy note 8. The developers are aware of this and have been waiting several months for a fix. Nothing. I am a premium subscriber and will not be renewing enough is enough,
Once you play around it's a great app. D downloaded due to a Jim rohn book,
"So far so good, still learning the specific features, but it's working well so far.",
It's an excellent app for time management and getting things done...I've never been more organised,
Asking multiple times for upgrade to premium fed up of this other else the app is very good,
Changed my life. There is power in its simplicity. Very easy but so powerfull,
I love this app. It's really helping me get my life together,
"Very good app overall, but there are two features I wish it had: 1) the ability to change what time the day ends. It's automatically set to midnight, which makes sense, but I don't sleep until 2 or 3 AM, if I mark a repeated task done after 12 AM, it won't show up again until the NEXT day. 2) the ability to put tasks on hold when you're traveling.",
This has become my go-to to do app.,
"Easy to use and the free version offers useful features, for example recurring tasks.",
"Great app! Definitely useful with the NPL, and good for keeping task lists on a weekly basis.",
Just moved from Wunderlist and wish I had sooner. Simple but powerful to do app!,
"Great app! Wonderful support, great organizational capabilities! Usefulness without bounds.",
"Literally, the perfect to do list, task and project management tool around.",
Extremely helpful. Smart app w/ right level of flexibility and simplicity.,
Seamless between my laptop and my phone app. Lots more power than Google tasks.,
Really like the functionality. Really really like it that I can add tasks from anywhere!,
I have tried many to do list apps. In my experience this one is the best,
Fully featured to-do list app. Worked well enough for my use case.,
Great and sipmply add to organize your tasks ... I love the easy input language,
"Helps me keep my work in order, very easy to use.",
This app helps me to improve my productivity. Very like.,
'Just what I needed to keep life simple. Thanks!,
"Very useful and easy to use, nice two-way sync with Google cal",
Good app but not worth all the money they ask to go premium,
"Excellent. Simple interface, easy to organise tasks. Syncs between android and desktop client.",
"Many to do lists I've tried, for me this is the best one.",
"Really useful when preparing for travel, planning events or to plainly set reminders",
"Reminders are for premium users. In that case, Evernote is much better.",
good app for keeping you organized. i like the layout and ease of use.,
So handy. Goes where I go and reminds me of stuff. LOVE it!!,
Helps me plan my bathroom breaks,
Better than iPhone to do list and still have today 2pm feature,
The perfect tool to get the chaos of work under control.,
The best task manager app of all online applications stores,
Capture those fleeting ideas in seconds,
Its kinda annoying but it works,
Really enjoying this app. Helps to stay organized!,
I can't wait for the new notification dots to be used.,
"Have been using it for a while now, it serves me😀",
The best to-do app I've used so far,
"I love it! It's easy to use and clean. Also, all my devices are synchronized. I really recommend the premium version, it's totally worthy ;)",
"Really good app, it is intuitive and easy to use.",
Increased my work productivity immediately. Great investment.,
i use it for my office work reminder and whenever i complete it i remove it.,
"Nice app, I wish it would allow hard returns",
Pretty easy and intuitive. Best part is that it is pretty flexible,
"Best ""to do"" app. Lot of advanced features. Can be adapted for personal Scrum.",
The best productivity app ever I seen,
So easy to use and great using the projects tabs,
Doing very well with the free product so far,
A great way to be very productive and be intrinsically rewarded for it,
Sad that it doesn't have location reminders..,
Really useful! Helps keep me on track!,
Works fine. It's easy to use and to manage.,
Love it!! Especially the point system and daily goals!,
Excellent app and worth paying for the upgrade.,
Organized days = Less Life-wasting... don't be average. Get this app!,
The best to do list ever!!,
Simple and easy to track activities and tasks,
Awesome tool for staying on top of life,
Great everyday and work task organizer,
"Good app. But pro account active charges is high . If you charges ₹110 x 1,00,00,000 = ₹10,00,00,000 . But you charges ₹2200 × 5000=~1,10,00,000",
"No ad, nice interface.",
This app it's a very useful app,
Great. Very helpful tool,
No support for Google tasks sync.,
Simple. Elegant. Gets the job done.,
Very helpful. Thanks to the developers.,
Used many and this is the best there is!,
"Simple & easy to use,  good app !",
Complicated not simple to use,
My life has been sorted... Thanks,
Works great!,
Works like a charm.,
Great app!,

It's a productivity boost,

what the hell,
"I'm using todoist for many years and the premium is well worth the money. I can see constant improvements over time and while the team seems unresponsive in some cases, I think they do a very good job at keeping the product simple and help to get productivity high. The best things for me are the possibility to nest tasks (decomposition helps me beat procrastination), flexible reminders and karma.",
I used to switch between different to-do apps but I've now been using Todoist for several years without thinking about changing. The app is updated regularly with small but worthwhile improvements and it just suits me very well. I would like to see better management of project deadlines added and a few other small changes but Todoist will be my to-do app for the foreseeable time.,
"Was great until updating my phone to Oreo. The widget no longer works which makes the app near useless for me. I paid for premium too so really good this gets fixed. It's not really acceptable for a paid service though.  Edit: The widget still doesn't work on Oreo on Go Launcher. Does anyone care about this? I'm paying for something I can't use anymore. Latest update: Thanks, the last reply I got a few months back was that you knew about the issue and working on a fix so I didn't provide any extra info. So on my Oneplus 3t on Oreo using Go Launcher I use the full widget on the next 7 days view. It doesn't scroll at all. If I add a new task using the plus sign then sometimes it displays the list part way down or a few days ahead so I can see the current day. I can select an item to edit it or tick it off but I can't drag or reorder tasks.",
"Well, I am very frustrated with one and only one thing... slow customer support. I have this issue with reminders where I can't add reminders anymore. Even though I have only few reminders, it keeps giving me an error that I can't have more than 700 reminders. I definitely don't have 700 reminders, it's not even close. My total number of tasks are little more than 100 only. It's been couple weeks since I have contacted them with this issue and they don't have a solution for me yet. I get an email from them every 3-5 days asking for some information and then I here back from them after few days. It's too bad as I like everything else about this app. If they can't fix it for me in time, I will try another app for my needs.  Update: Still no fix after weeks of wait. I am moving on to different todo app ""ticktick"" now.",
"Very simple to use due to it understanding natural language and shortcuts are easy to get acquainted with. Android widget allows me to quickly screen out irrelevant projects during work hours. Still itching to try out the location specific reminders but it's great knowing I have the feature. Love that I can add and work on tasks from phone or on my Mac. Something that could take this to the next level as a productivity tool is the ability to add a ""Done list"" feature that tallies the completion of repeating tasks so that you can chart and work on habits or see how your cumulative training in one aspect is going across a calendar or by minutes/hours spent.",
"Too bloated, takes the long way round to do the simplest of tasks. March 12/18: I was asked by Todoist to provide additional info on how this app could be improved with regard to speeding up the time it takes in order to do simple;  here is one example. Adding a simple task via Google Home is a chore. You add the   Task, set the project, priority etc. and once that is done is takes far too long to excite the damn program. ""Do you want to make any changes?"" and  if no, it then asks if there is anything else. This is unnecessary and the pauses are ridiculous. Why can't you just say, ""ok I'm done"" or I'm finished, instead, bypassing the wait time. Also, the Google Home support is poor, it doesn't recognize plurals, the help files are unhelpful and MOST OF ALL designating date and time is confusing and rarely works for me. And for God's sakes, if the program doesnt recognise a command it goes through the whole damned shpeel (?) about what it actually CAN do EVERY TIME. This app was too expensive to have such easily correctable issues. You can't even dictate notes or memos. For shame.",
I've been needing some organization in my life and they provide it! It's so great that I can literally be anywhere in the world and use this software. My work is not too keen on letting unauthorized software come on to the computer so it's great to have a webapp when I don't feel like using this small phone screen.,
"Despite all the high ratings, this was not useful at all for me. I have to pay just to set a simple reminder! I couldn't find a help section to instruct on how to use the app and had to come to play-store for that. I set a task after two minutes and waited, and after two minutes, nothing happens, no reminder no action. What is the point of this app then. It might work well for others but not for me.",
"This tool is fantastic ! I cannot believe that I didn't discover it earlier, had tried so many others, always quickly abandoned. Todoist is extremely simple to use, very user friendly, but nevertheless it has a wide range of possibilities and really helps you get things done. I love how easy it is to create repetitive tasks. It is multi-platforms, synchronisation between devices is automatic and instantaneous. The support section is very helpful and there's a lot of instruction videos on YouTube. I suscribed for the paid version, it's worth the price for me, but you can get very well along with the free version.",
I am new to this kid of app. So far I love it! Especially the abreviations you can just type in to decise the time and the category. They are so intuitive you can almost just guess them! Only thing missing is a full adapted app to the samsung gear watch. It shows the tasks through notifications but only wjen they are due and you dont have a lot of options on it.,
"Great app, simple to use and very intuitive! Helps me keep all my tasks in line & make sure I have done everything I need to do for work. Only issue is occasionally the app does not sync properly with the website & chrome plugin, which can cause some tasks (usually those inputted directly into the app) to be overlooked without intentionally looking at the app. Other than that, it would get the full 5⭐",
"Would love a simple way to set a simple reminder. e.g. Remind me to put the bins out at 8pm, and have various beeps etc try to get my attention at this specific time. Perhaps this disagrees with the App's philosophy, but I would certainly love this feature.",
"Love this app. Its helped me a lot in noting down things I need to do or remember and doing so not have to juggle as many tasks in my head. Its great a really great productivity tool. However there are features that could be added that I think users would find really useful like a way to put subtasks under one larger to do task. And a better folder system to organize things needed to be remembered for today as vs in a week, month, or year.",
"Like nearly every other Task List app these days, its idea of ""Themes"" is changing the color of a bar across the top of the screen; the theme doesn't alter the black on white text style of the application.  Nothing beats white on black for easy on the eyes and since I'm literally in my task list ALL DAY LONG, the absence of that display feature is a deal breaker. I currently use a very simplistic app with a ""night mode"" that coverts the display from black on white to white on black. That free app also integrates with Google Tasks for seamless portability across all of my devices. How is it that this vendor decides that integration is a PREMIUM feature? I certainly not PAYING just to discover that I don't like how it integrates with Google!  Uninstalling the app after I submit this review.",
Came to me as a recommendation from another entrepreneur. Thought it would be tacky as I'm not really into apps but am I ever blown away. Productivity has soared and turned small tasks into a game. It's actually pretty fun but super helpful,
"Love this app, is perfect for keeping on top of assignments and the fact 
that it scores you on how well you are doing creates a sense of motivation 
to do tasks that you keep putting off. Apart from certain features being 
restricted for free accounts, I can't fault this app :)",
Probably one of the best To Do list apps left. Other good ones have been bought and closed down. Hopefully Todoist will survive.,
"This app single handedly teached me how to organise my life. I noticed how 
important it is to worry less about your system like colors of your tasks 
and instead focus on doing them and figuring out the next step. Awesome 
team and app design. Highly recommend!",
"Encouraging thoughts after completing tasks is particularly what made me choose Todoist over other applications.  Also, the display colours are good.",
"paid version seems great, but I'm not willing to pay that much to find out.   I would like some of the functions (text reminders, calendar integration) without paying so much.   Otherwise good interface.",
The most awesome Part is that e.g. For the reminders you can write 'every 2 days' and you will have your reminder every second day,
"Great app! Really allows me to lay out tasks and projects in a way that works for me, and I love that I can have it up on my computer while at work, then walk away and use it on my phone. I just wish there were more color-coding options for projects!",
Best task list app I've tried. Especially nice for repeated tasks like bills as the task order can be resorted by date.,
"The 2-way Google Calendar sync is the killer feature that made me switch to this app.  Still missing: a GUI for setting recurrence of tasks. The natural language input is ok, but a GUI like Google Calendar would be a good complement!",
"I really loved it. I actually tried 1-2 similar app for setting goals or Todo list, but I find this one very convenient and simple.",
"I don't need complex app..but compared to a previous one, at least this can do different project lists which is fab.",
Love this app. Almost immediately bought the premium version because it was useful and practical. They do a really good job of making it easy to use,
This app is absolutely great. It is quite intuitive after reading about application functionality on the website. I wish that there was a lifetime subscription option rather than a yearly option. Premium is completely worth it.,
It's a good App. Only missing thing is reminders in free version. Premium price is very high as I don't think other than reminders I need any other premium feature. Overall very useful app,
This app motivate you to work hard or to do tasks properly at the r8. Time...lazy people   should definitely try this app,
"Very good app. In this day and age when things are so fast, it helps me stay on track. Also love the email reminders every morning.",
"Very happy with this app. Well thought out, feels so intuitive to use and has really helped me be more productive with very little extra effort on my part.",
It is very easy to use to do list app. Sends reminders promptly. Helps me track activities regularly. the concept of karma also makes u finish your tasks. All great except sometimes browser extensions provided by todoist doesn't sync unless we relogin,
I've been using the premium version of this app for some time now and the only thing I wish it had was a progress bar and an amoled black theme,
"Very good for larger goals or things done on an intermittent basis. For things you want to do daily, use a habit tracker. There is a huge difference and you will ruin your experience with this app if you ask it to do things it isn't meant for.  If it could integrate with my calendar, that would be the holy grail.",
"I am still confused. My level of confusion is less now, but it is getting better.",
"Very user-friendly and I absolutely love the priority feature, it helps me manage my day a lot better.",
This is the perfect App for us OCD folks.  I especially love the way it works across multiple devices.,
"Great app, but the widget (functionality that i consider to be essential for daily usage) is broken and needs bug fixing before I'll award a 5 star rating.",
Absolutely love it. The extensive integration all the way from browser to laptop to smartphone really has kept me on track because my to-dos are always at my fingertips. Highly recommend!,
"Todoist is a very user friendly and practical app for creating and tracking tasks, complete with email reminders to help you stay on task!",
Just can't live without it. It's become my second brain for all sorts of trivia and daily stuff. It's become my trusted system. Absolutely love it.,
"Love the simplicity of it -- a view of your to-do list for today and for the week, and that's it. Also love the natural language processing for when I create a to-do item.",
The best todo app I've used by far. It has a few shortcomings but nothing serious. I would love if you added dark theme for night use - similar to what Twitter and Medium do.,
Awesome! please keep improving adding tasks as efficient as possible. i think that smart input widgets could do the job better than the text commands in some cases.,
"Super tool for remembering and prioritizing tasks. I especially like that I 
can organize them according to client or project. I also like the voice to 
text option",
A fantastic tool that helps you to be productive and reminds you if you have any tasks that you didn't complete so that it holds you accountable to complete your tasks for the day.,
I've begun to realize that I'm the type of person who needs to be reminded of things due to a hectic schedule. This app keeps me on track with everything.,
I wish you could allow time logging for tasks and in turn allow the user to understand planned vs actual results. Willing to fund development of feature! Get the two features and it's 5 stars.,
Its good. The time and repeating set up is nonintuitive when you first use it but you get accustomed to it.,
This has to be one of the most intuitive and flexible task applications I have ever used. The number of features implemented by this application is insane. It had features I didn't even know I wanted.,
I manage my entire business and personal life through this app.  Don't know what I'd do without it.,
"I tend to use Todoist as a shared task / grocery list with my partner. My only gripe is when you add an item it goes to the bottom of the list, but I would prefer it goes to the top.",
"I was looking for an app that handles reoccurring events, allows me to collaborate with my wife, has good android widgets, is simple to use and most importantly did not require me to spend money to have those features. I tried any do, trello, and some others and this one fits the bill!",
An awesome app. My productivity has such an increase since I actively use this app. Perfect also to organize our small team for a YouTube channel and assign tasks for planned trips etc.,
"Powerful task manager. Intuitive UI, although sorting subtasks is finnicky on mobile. Great feature set in the free tier.",
"Very useful and easy to use tool. I use it for everything. I upgraded to the premium, I don't really see the point, but I figured I'd try it out.",
This app is ready tho use.  I like the projects and the today and 7 day.  I also like that you can stack items under a task.,
Am impressed at how quick and easy it is to add tasks. Would dearly like a repeated task eg take pills every morning.,
Love it so much! It honestly has changed my life to make me more productive and remember things that I had to do! LOVE IT!!!,
"I like that I tell it what and when I need to do a task, as opposed to a notification of my task. Somehow, I feel motivated to check to see what is left to do for the day.",
"Wonderful. I'm a fan of consolidating many different tasks and uses into one package, and this app does a wonderful job at this. You can run your life off this app, and that's saying something.",
"It's a fun app, and considering I hate opening to do lists that's a great thing, to make it fun.",
"ToDoist is the best tool for tracking everything. It's easy, portable, and the team behind it is always working to make it exactly what you need. If you are a GTD enthusiast, this is the app you need.",
"I love it. After a while testing a lot of apps, you finally convinced me!",
This is a great app for organising your life and is a daily reminder of things to be done. It challenges you to check things off the list so they aren't continually rolling over into the next day,
"Pathetically bad natural language understanding. People stating it has good at this obviously do not know what that means. I talk naturally, it is supposed to understand. This service takes commands, not natural language and has nothing to do with natural languages at all.",
"I downloaded the app; put in my first task for 11:00 am. I was feeding the baby and asked my husband what time it was and he said ""11:06"" so I checked my phone and there were no reninders for the task from 11:00 am. It is now 11:58 am and still no reminders have come up so I am deleting the app and will look for one that works.",
"I've tried plenty of to-do lists apps and this one is by far the best. Been using it for over 2 years and it has all I need and more. Even the free version. It's so complete that after so long I'm still finding new features that make it even easier to organise tasks, it's that well done and complete. Really, highly recommend it!",
Overall the app is very helpful and well designed. I would find it very comfortable to have dark theme which includes dark window background with a bright accent color 😉,
"This an awesome to do / project sharing App. I get so much more done in a day, now!  Get the app and the upgrade.  It is worth your investment in productivity.",
"Just a few days & start with basic application, great user-friendly tools & options. Likely over the next couple of weeks I'll probably sign for the Premium option. Need to go over help / tutorial menu to fully maximize all features. Keep up the great work.",
"Good app, would be great if it offered reminders in free version. But no complaints since it's more than one can ask for",
"Before using this App I was using Microsoft Do, and after switching to this App, I found it lot more better than MS Do.",
"Great app, best I've tried yet. Sync between desktop, mobile, and web a bit off.",
This is a wonderful app. I've been using it for all my todos for the past 3 months and it's super good.,
"Not sure why, but this app, as much as I like it, freezes my android, Samsung 6 like no ones business...I mean an absolute freeze, takes forever to get the phone to reboot...seems to happen when I use the voice option to dictate a note ... I wish they'd fix it, the reason for the two stars",
"After trying many to do list apps, I settled on todoist. Because it actually fulfills all your needs. Most likeable feature is easy access from any platform and smart scheduling of tasks. Simply, loving it.",
"Helps get your life in order, everything is not behind a paywall which is useful for students but the option is there if you want more in-depth options",
Great app for linking with Amazon Echo. My husband and I use it to keep track or errands and shopping lists,
"It's not obvious (even with a web search) how to do simple things like routines, or having a task repeat more than once a day.",
Cracking app for organising projects and everyday tasks. Urea helping me loads!,
overall this is good. But in premium version reminder management for team members is pathetic.,
"Love this app, has helped me keep track of things and do more each day",
"Simple to use, makes it lots easier to keep track of tasks and build habits thanks to recurring tasks.",
Really helpful and the interface is very user friendly.  Easy for me to log all my activity.  I love it,
It's been great keeping track of my progress and tasks. I had been looking for exactly this for years.,
The free version is very useful for basic categorized task management. I use it for both work and home tasks.,
"Awesome for recurring tasks and todays tasks! No more, no less.",
Really love this app but it's too expensive! 30 euros for a years subscription!,
"I've tried many ""to do"" apps but I like the fact that this app works with Alexa. Marvelous",
Best to do app. Switched from wunderlist since it is going away. Like todoist even better so far.,
"best reminder and to do app on the market. It's simple, intuitive, and full of features. worth every penny.",
Best for my use cases ! Love the natural language task addition feature. Perfect for offloading thoughts and following up.,
Easy to use. Helpful reminders without being annoying.,
"Voice commands with Google Assistant are useful, in addition to a very practical, rich app for task management.",
"This app keeps me moving towards my goals by breaking them down into tasks which I can schedule and commit to, Thanks todoist!",
The only app I have come across that best helps me manage my tasks.,
"It's the most comfortable and minimal app ever! I like yo use it for personal use, work, and creative projects. Best app i used to organize my to does!!!!",
"intuitive, simple, helps getting stuff done and stays out of your way.",
The App helps me remember things I need to do or get where ever I am and it is easy to use!,
"Nice app and easy for tracking tasks to complete, that's what I was looking for but... 30$ for the premium version? No thanks",
"Clean interface, simplistic, and easy to use. I had another to do list app before this, but it was too cluttered with extras and mini games I didn't care about. I'll be using this app from now on, I love it. :)",
Todoist has become a must use everyday of my life... great for organization and scheduling!,
I've only used this app for one week and I already feel way more organized than I was before!,
"Helps my business team stay on top of projects. It's a great productivity 
tool.",
I can not live without this app. Thank you very much!,
Wonderful app -- Hate that I'm the weakest link in the chain!,
"Amazing app, does the work in the most simple way imaginable.",
I love it so much! I just wish there were more colour options!,
Best app ever !! Help me with alot to organization of my life,
Amazing flexible list making app. This can be adapted to support  multiple productivity apps.,
"Great app, ideal for organising both business and personal lists.",
My wife and I use this to keep a running shopping list and also to keep track of appointments. It's perfect!,
"It's cool, wish you could connect to Google calendar though",
Great free features. But have to pay for the really cool ones,
Great app. It really helps you organize you to-do list. Easy to use,
Great app for a free todolist app.The premium might even be better.,
It's so close to perfect it makes me annoyed about what's missing,
Love this app. Keeps me organized without slips of paper all over the place.,
All necessary features are premium. Pointless.,
"Gotta love a ""virtual mom"" reminding me what I need to do, or what I haven't done yet.~",
Reminders could be easier to set up and could be improved if it synced better with MS outlook.,
"Very good app, even the free version. Serious and practical. Thank you developers.",
Simple but powerful enough to do everything you need. Recommended.,
"Todoist, quite simply, has changed my life. I'm forever grateful.",
"Great app, helping me to get organised, works with Alexa.",
Loving the natural language input feafure. Has nice and clean interface.,
Very useful and helpful app to keep track of your tasks and efficient management of pending tasks,
Not the same as my last use google task. But nice and quick way to set task,
Great app but the free version could have more features,
Free version is clunky but works,
Totally useless. The karma system is broken.,
Good basic to-do app for general use!,

Great,
I like it,
My preciousss,
I like it,
This is ok,
it works.,
Dope,
I use the basic version of this app for all of my to-do items across my life.  It is wonderful.  I sync it with my Google calendar to schedule when I complete each task during my day; it's highly effective. The only thing I wish they had was the ability to postpone one occurrence of a reoccurring task without changing the series itself.,
"This is exactly what I am looking for, for a personal to do list. It helps me stay on top of daily tasks so I can build habits. Haven't used it for work but it looks good for that too.  I don't know if I would get the premium version. The price seems a bit steep when I can get Microsoft office for 20 to 40 bucks more.",
"This is one of my top 5 apps I use daily. It keeps me productive and helps me get all of my 'to dos' out of my head so I can put it in this app, give it a date & category, and not worry about it again until Todoist reminds me to do it. Before I found this I was endlessly overwhelmed with tasks that needed to be done and not knowing where to begin. Other apps and calendars have never touched what Todoist has helped me to accomplish and the peace of mind it gives me to know I've got a plan for keeping up with my priorities.",
"I wish I could give this app 4.5 stars. If it integrated smoothly with Google Inbox, I would give it 5 stars for sure. It integrates very smoothly with Gmail (but I really like Inbox) so if you use Gmail, you'll love this.   You can add emails to your task list. You can say ""Ok Google and a task_____"" by way of an IFTTT applet, you can categorize your tasks as 'projects', and you can collaborate with others.  I bought the premium (not too expensive) and that allows me to add reminders...to my phone or via email. I use the chrome extension, though, so who needs an email when the icon is staring at you 24/7 from the top of the page! I was disappointed that I couldn't add a reminder without buying the premium, but the way the app syncs with my phone and my desktop, reminders are really not needed.   Tasks are added to my google calendar (which I toggle off, since it's so cluttered).   So far, very efficient. After I use it for another month or so, I'll re-review.",
100% recommended : It is an essential app to have in your phone to have your day to day tasks or even  your sporadic tasks organized.  Tip: Let the app worry what you need to do all day so that you can focus on the task at hand.  You guys have done a fascination job developing this vital app.,
I used to use an app that had many more options and was reluctant to switch but now I really enjoy the simplicity of Todoist. Labels can be used if you wish to add more tracking options such as context or goals. I find myself spending more time getting things done now vs organizing tasks. Biggest plus for me is that it is cross platform and has an API that is easy to work with so I can import my tasks from the prior app I was using. The Google Home integration is also fantastic!,
"Loving using the basic version. Really like the fact that you can categorise them into dufferent projects, add the priority and set recurring tasks. It's very intuitive and easy to use. Keeps me on track and I'm more productive because of it.   Much prefer this to Trello.",
"This app has changed my life. I now have everything i need to achieve all in one place and am so much more productive. It's really simple to use and I can organise all aspects of my life, from a simple shopping list to large complex work projects. love it!",
Awesome app. Great UI. Well built logic which makes it flow even better. The team did a great job. I do wish that comment didn't come as a premium feature but I completely understand. I'd suggest a student pricing model. Thank you for the app.,
Awesome. Moved to this from ASANA because of better pricing. Missing some features but overall has changed the entire way I do task mangement. Instant sync with calendar and good integration into Gmail make it all worth it.,
switched to this from Any.Do and it's gotten my life in order so much. helps with college life like you wouldn't believe. also helps me organize my personal life and projects to a whole new level. definitely worth paying premium. this app will change your life .,
"I love this app, though I wish I could set long time goals. I tried to write my chores for my allowance on it, and every single day I get the notification my chore is overdue. Maybe add a feature where the goal doesn't have a due date. (Unless I have not found the feature yet)",
Love this Todo app. So simple and focused on the task at hand. Google calendar integration is great as well. Would like to see that improved with links directly to the task,
I will never pay $30 for a app like this. Just like Google to make this the only reminder app other than the stock one on my phone. Always money! Always about GOOGLE GREED. This apps developer is not to blame for Google's choice and making them the only other alternative default reminder app on Android OS. Actually I would congratulate this apps designers because they successfully signed on to deal with Google to make some money. Well it won't come out of my wallet.,
"Advertises itself as a free app, yet keeps begging me to upgrade to premium to unlock even the most basic features.",
Really nice to use and I like the grouping of tasks using projects. Only thing I think it is lacking is the ability to have a greater depth of sub tasks.,
Initially all went well and have used the app for months. Even tried the Premium but its too expensive. Unable to use the free version with google calender sync. If the free version cant even remind then whats the use.,
"""Free forever"" is incredibly misleading when every other button you push nags you to upgrade to Premium. As far as i can tell there is no way to even view my completed years. There are plenty of free alternatives that serve my needs just fine.",
Best app to stay focused and get things done. Just be loyal to it and things will start happening (:,
"Wow, you are not able to write longer texts / details under your ""notes"" (which would then only be their name). The app is basically works only for managing one liner type of notes. This is ridiculous. TickTick is much better alternative.",
"It's one of those apps I can't do without especially on my journey to master productivity, focus and discipline",
This app is amazing; it helps you achive your goals and remember important things in your life. This app is so helpful that it made me not forget anything!,
I have been using productivity apps for years and have used no less than half a dozen different apps. So far this works the best for me. Love the ability to have subprojects.,
Great app. I like the functionality of changing the list from widgets which most of other apps lack. They just open up the app. Increased productivity. Thanks 👍🏼,
"Platform ambiguous so I can get notified on my Mac, iPad, and Android phone. Great stuff",
"I don't rate apps, just because I'm lazy. But, Todoist is a wonderful app when used properly. Has changed my life and outlook on how I complete tasks.",
"Great app but it would be better if we could customize the report. It would be great to sort by date or collaborators. Being able to select what is shown on the report i.e. the full name of the collaborators, date and time. Otherwise very easier to access and use. The support team are very efficient and always willing to help.",
Best to-do app. I love its minimalist design and the fact that it supports almost all platforms is a bonus. I got the premium version which unlocked even more cool stuff.,
Good intuitive todo app. Easy to learn.  Good balance between getting things done versus getting in your face.,
Enjoying the free version. Understandably there are many features only in the paid version which are missing so I can't comment on them.,
"It does what it says it does.. fantastic and easy to use. The main drawback is that it is dependent on the person actually using it. So if you are not driven to start with, you need to work on motivation first. The software is very useful . I highly recommend it!!",
The user interface is a nice balance between easy to use and powerful features. I like the availability on many platforms and ability to share projects. Also the IFTTT integration rocks.,
"It has Google calendar genuine two way sync. Karma concept encourages you to keep checking in. Lots of flexibility with labels / projects. I've tried all the main other apps available (toodledo, 2do spring to mind) but this is by far the best and good value for money.",
"The karma points really encourage you to do things. The premium version is worth it.  it weren't for todoist, I don't know how I would deal with my routine.",
excellent app that is far easier to navigate and use than so so many others.. and I tested a lot before I decided on this one.  The sort and tag options are well worth paying for and it integrates with google cal very well.,
"I selected Todoist as my primary todo list app after looking at many options. It's got a good balance of multi platform integration, features and usability.",
Loved the simple design and helpful guides. It gets things done and motivates one to do more.,
Great app if you put yourself through an adaptation curve. Brings the management of your days and productivity to a higher level. Overall quite intuitive and polished experience.,
"Signed up for $28/yr premium plan for the text reminders. So far loving this app/service. Very helpful, lots of integrations -- especially for users of Google products 👍 Now to convince the family and co-workers to sign up so I can assign tasks easily!",
This is my first time using any sort of task managing app for all me personal stuff and it is seriously life changing. I went straight to premium (online reviews said totally worth it) and I'm extremely happy with all the features!,
"Good service, would like more location info about my to do's. I got rained on, could have rescheduled the task if the app had warned me.",
This app is exactly what I needed. Other to-do lists have never worked for me. But the way that projects can be established with lists under each makes it very powerful. I also enjoy the integration with Outlook. Very stable app.,
Would of actually of bought this app if it was a one of payment and not a yearly subscription. Now have to look for another app like this.,
"I'm still new at this, but I've been using todoist for about a week and am finding it very helpful.",
Great for reminding me about upcoming homework and daily tasks that I need to do. All it needs is a dark theme for the app and it would alot nicer in my opinion.,
This app usually has some feature or benefit that others apps do not. Thank you. Love Todoist,
Would be great if you could allow parallel and dependent tasks and Gantt charting - would be complete project management app then! Otherwise great.,
Love that it's possible to set a date on sub-tasks. Coordinates well w my desktop at work.,
"Good app! I can't really think of a reason not to use it. I use it as a basic day to day to-do list, and I like how easy it is to use.",
It's really good app to plan your tasks. Language processing is really helpful to add task quickly,
"I love it! The repetitive tasks make my life so much easier, and the non premium is really all that I need, the UI is absolutely gorgeous! I never leave reviews but this app definitely worth it! Keep up the good work",
"So, they have trial where you put your credit card first. Guess what? They do not keep silence on trial end trying to bill you, but sent a warning with push up notification that trial is going to end and they will bill you soon. 10 honesty of 10.",
"After 3 months of use, my daily life, work, study have completely changed ! With this app I can control my life.",
It's a good app it works for me but I only use it for a notepad little always have in my pocket,
It has become my best friend reminds me of stuff I keep putting off now I'm getting it done,
"As a person with depression, this tool is easy and fun to use. It reminds me what I need to do for the day and then gives me points for doing them.",
Good for GTD people. Needs 'create new after completion' recurring option.,
Excellent keeping track. I find that the integration is generally very good except once a task is moved in the app that change does not update in my google calendar which can be confusing and results in lots of tasks in Google calendar which either completed or moved. But overall I really like todoist,
Great for to-dos not great for notes... Unless you pay the subscription,
Its annoying but it helps me be organize with small task,
fantastic app! just wish it was easier to create subtasks; also wish there were more colour options for labels.,
"The only way I can keep up with school, work, and side projects. Just love it!",
What i was looking for after bunch of other similar apps. Very easy to operate. I really like it,
"Works great. It's the only to do list I've stuck to, and I've tried many.",
"This is the best productivity app out there. I know, because I've tried all.",
"Please fix sidebar animation speed, way too slow, and the edit screen animation speed is too fast",
"Great idea, a cross platform list so I don't get lost in Facebook!  Intuitive layout, easy to use, helps me manage my tasks and stay focused. Thanks!",
Would not let me repeat tasks. Why so many good reviews? Have to pay 30 dollars a year to get that feature I guess. Command feature for any scheduling app.,
"Great app sends emails, takes awhile to get in the habit to use it",
"Simple to use with lots of shortcuts making it easy to enter, label, schedule, and prioritize my tasks.  Sweet!",
It's an easy to use app! Use it professionally and personally every day.,
It is so simple to use and very helpful. Thank Todoist so much!,
The only to-do-list app that makes sense to me!,
Must have a login to use. No way! Get out of my life!,
I basically run my life using Todoist now. Way better than Cozi,
"For the free version, it makes list easy to find and organize.",
Good to use! It helps me to stay organized with my life!,
Annoying. Always send me spam email. Annoying you!,
Great app and platform. You gotta go all in to make full use of it.,
This has been essential to me getting my dang life on track. Five Stars,
This is the best task managing app I have ever used. Well done.,
For a todo list it should be absolutely unnecessary to make an account.,
Quick and very simple to use. Takes care of my need perfectly,
Sometimes it's a bit clunky but generally the app is good.,
"Simple but flexible, intuitive, and a great organizational and productivity tool.",
Great App to use it. It improves productivity drastically.,
Good basic functionality. Decent integration with Amazon Alexa. Could be better but does the job.,
Need to have a premium account for basic features like comments and reminders? A bit misleading to call this free to use...,
It does what I want. Minimalist and not a hassle to set up an itenerary.,
I love looking back on what I accomplished during the day. Todoist makes it easier to be productive.,
Great for organizing my day and week. Integrates with Alexa to make shopping and tasks simple and organic.,
I really love this app. I use it on multiple devices and I'm able to print out anything that I need to.,
"It does a thing, it does it well.",
This works great. I will have to upgrade and get all the features,
"Decent task lists , not good for recurring check lists.",
Would be great if reminders were offered in free version,
Love the clean design and ability to use on all my devices,
"Still trying it out, but I like it so far.",
Really good way to keep your tasks on check and accesible via different devices,
"Feature packed, built for novice and well as the expert, intuitive, wonderful app",
One of the best to do apps.  Excellent for collaboration!,
Great app. Really worth the money. The best,
"Really useful software, however widget sometime freezing",
User interface is very nice and I really like how it recognises dates and times from natural language,
Great simple productivity app. Minimalist yet powerful.,
Great way of keeping track of things that pop up.,
"Efficient and minimal, like this review.",
So awesome. Took my game at work to next level.,
Changed my life -work and home,
Great for daily and weekly reminders and I love that it syncs with Alexa!,
Good but additional features come only with the premium version.,
"Really useful, have been recommending it to friends and colleagues",
Amazing App to get your work done. Loving it,
Good app. Needs better sorting for 5*,
Love the natural language interface. Reminders are easy to customize.,
A great task app for getting stuff done.,
Tasty but a bit like a chicken pie lol,
"Love this app. Easy to use with an intuitive, clean interface across all platforms (phone, tablet, pc) with compatibility for all needed operating systems (Android, Mac o/s, Windows, iOS)",
"Easy and intuitive, perfect for entrepreneurs.",
Just what I needed for simple project task management.,
Works perfectly. I switched from Google Keep to Todoist,
Easy to see and does what I need.,
Great app if you want to pay for it,
Easy to use to do list with widget and reminder,
It makes my to do list fun,
This app is optimized for my device.,
Really seems to help. Easy to use.,
"Elegant, streamlined, and productivity inducing.",
"Definitely does what it supposed to, and does it perfectly well :)",
Get your projects and your life organized!,
Helps my brain to stay focused,
"Neat & streamlined, very intuitive to use.",
This app is all I wanted,
Simple and beautiful and keeps me on track,
It keeps me incredibly organized,
Very good to do list manager,
"Poor app, very limited in the free version",
can not see completed task and repeat them without premium,
"Claramente a melhor solução de produtividade. Combinado com o Evernote, ninguém precisa de mais nada.",
Great functionality and ease of use.,
"Simple and easy,  great app",
So far so good.,
Guys...the notification of Ticktick is better,
Best I've used yet,
Reminder is a premium feature? Really? That's a basic that should be given. Uninstalled in 5 minutes.,
This app is a life saver..,
Best ever. For anyone.,
"Great app, love it!",
The best todo app!!! Love it!,
"Het werkt gewoon echt goed om alles te organiseren wat je te doen hebt, heel fijn!",
Nice app.. very helpful..,
"Love it,  simple and effective",
Get organized people.,

Good apo,
Very useful,
Awesome App,
Great app,
Very handy,
Very easy,
Good app,
Keep improving,
Good app,
Great app,
Great app,
Excellent app,

Supports wear,
"No pensaba que fuera a ayudarme realmente, pero lo ha hecho. Dentro de lo desorganizado que soy, ha conseguido que cumpla metas y objetivos.",
Great,
Perfect,
Great,
Useful,
It's okay.,
"Ok app, does what you need... Could use a few extras (doesn't let you back date an event so it can be tracked)",
Thanks!,
get this app,
Nul,
ดี,
Luved it,
"I like the app but a few things would make it better, in my opinion. One is a history of accomplished tasks, the other would be to show the tasks scheduled for tomorrow (I plan my day the previous night and have to manually check every project to know what I should prioritize). A third would be a way to see unscheduled tasks all at once. Still very useful.",
"With its quick and intuitive ""add"" feature, you don't have to go through several menus to say what time, date or where your task is supposed to be happening. You simply type in ""Meet John Doe at Place on Tuesday at 10am"" and it creates a task ""Meet John Doe"" at Place for tomorrow at 10am.  Total game changer for a person like me who forgets things super easy.",
"Pretty easy to use, however reminders could be a bit annoying, since you can't edit right away when you want it to ring. It automatically sets at 30 min before task. I'm new to it so it could be something I 'm missing.",
"I really like this app because it notifies me when things are overdue, and also brings me reminders.  Very good app to use when you plan out your weeks on a calendar and write the to do's on this app. Helps me remember when I have so much going on.  I recommend anyone to get this app.",
"This app was a major disappointment. My main issue is that you can't manually change the recurrence of an event or thing to do. If you can't figure out how to phrase it correctly when you create the event, you're SOL.   I wanted to create a thing to do that occurred every 4 weeks on Sunday, but the phrasing to do so wasn't intuitive and once I figured it out, it would change it to ""every Saturday"" for some reason.   Also, when I assigned a parent task, it would put it under the parent and then also list it separately as it's own thing, making it look like I had twice as many things to do. Also, it kept reassigning parent tasks when I moved tasks and since there's no way to edit multiple tasks at once, I had to individually reassign the parent to each task. Overall, my experience with the app was incredibly frustrating.",
"Todoist has helped me get my life organized so that I can get to some of the most important things that I've wanted to do. Since I've been using it, I've started learning Spanish, practicing guitar, and doing more regular devotions with my wife. It's been a great way to get more focused.",
Simple. Bt cannot able to add people. Evn normal features like reminders are for premium version.,
"This is the the type of to do list that gives respect to ""naturally occurring unexpected happenings"" while reminding you that you need to move your ass.",
There are too many features only available via upgrade. Everything is an up-sale. Like remembering repeated tasks. The upgrade is too expensive.,
"I've used a lot of apps and used to just stick with Google Tasks, but this is way better. I love all the integration with outlook and chrome as well as the new tablet interface. Nothing bad to say about it, and am looking forward to new features being added.",
"Well considered UI. I especially appreciate the location alert editor. It suggests recent places and responds to where you are. Overriding US defaults, as I have had to in other such systems, is incredibly grating",
Haven't used all the features yet but is easy and intuitive to use. Definitely helping me keep my business appointments in order. Recommend this.,
"I like it. Simple useful. The ordering gets really glitchy on me at times though. Also I wish it had a ""weighting"" system for tasks to remind you Wich are worth more",
Really liking this app. Being able to just see this day's tasks is very helpful. And I appreciate being able to adjust the sequence of the tasks on a given day. Thank you.,
Definitely better for task management than GoogleTasks. I like that you can divide everything into projects,
"Helps me stay on top of everything I need to do, both at work and at home. It's the only productivity app I've ever stuck with for more than a couple of months.",
"Other than some esoteric quirks with task nesting, timed tasks, rescheduling, and notifications, good app. Reliable.",
Have only been using this for a week but so far it's great. Will update if any issues arise.,
"Very good. I love the persistent nagging when the task is overdue, unlike some apps that are too discrete in reminding you.",
Amazing. But minus 2 star for not letting me to subscribe monthly. Too bad.,
"Overall, this app is incredible. It's helped me not forget things I need to do, it's helped me keep track of my projects & commitments.   This app has made me incredibly productive. I highly suggest you check it out, dear review-reader!  When this gets the Oreo update, I'll bump this to 5 stars, as it will be practically perfect then.",
Works great! Keeps me on track. I'm very good at forgetting things and this is a great reminder.,
"Clear design, nice widget (but lags a little sometimes) would've liked an option to view all labels together in the widget (also without date), now it results for me not into not using the labels, which is a bit of a shame.",
A great app for keeping me on task.  Enjoyable to be able to tick off jobs,
"Intuitive, available on any platform, good design. I find almost what I need in this app. Please make an option to make the all completed tasks always visible without pressing ""completed task"" button.",
This app has so far been very helpful for a person who always needs reminders of what and when to do things! I especially love the integration with Google Calendar!,
"Very helpful, like the layout, could do without having to pay for premium to get access to so much",
This is a helpful app the only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't automatically arrange things,
Absolutely the best app I've ever installed. Changed the way I organize my life.,
"Widget reverts back to ""today"" view everyday when i want it to stay on 'inbox'",
I am using this application for last two years and it is really good application for my time management and daily activities.,
Great app to help organize grocery lists with spouse and group projects as well as stuff around the house.,
I wish it would make things that are due on a day simply light up and make themselves visible on the homepage,
I am using the free version and so far I love it! There are features I didn't know about and everything works exactly how I want! Can't even make critiques at this point! Great app!,
"Intuitive, easy to use, some features that are not supported by other similar apps.",
The best app to make 'to do list'. Really worth a try. Helps to collaborate with others too.,
Read through the reviews. Everyone is saying clean interface...,
Very useful and easy to use! It is helping me a lot to keep me organized.,
Great way to keep my A.D.D. at bay..I like how simple it is !,
One of the few apps that has just smoothly done 99% of what I want,
"Everything is perfect. However, regular weekly planner view would be helpful",
"Efficient, reliable, deceptively simple. Quite possibly the best GTD app extant.",
"This is an awesome app. Easy to use, quick and fun!",

"I have asked todoist to add indents like what Wunderlist has to make subtasks easy to see on an Android phone, yet they still don't seem to get it. The Web version has it, so why not the mobile version. Also I questioned how it was hard to see priorities with a tiny slice of colour on an Android phone which was met with the same response. These guys don't care about things that would make it easier for its end users. If they fixed these, then I would certainly give it 5 stars.",
"I can't say enough good things about this.  I've been using for a long time and every update is better.  I'm totally lost with it.  I use it with my spouse to organize our lives,  I use it to organize my kids and homeschooling, I use it to track my housework, my laundry- I use it for everything.  It's the simplest format that somehow still does everything I need.  Premium is awesome and the new student/teacher discount is fantastic.",
"New user, 1 week in. Easy to use in comparison to Outlook, To Do, or Remember the Milk (all which I have used). Some good features are paid and so not enabled, it would be nicer if at least some of that useful functionality could be available. Otherwise, the cross platform seamlessness will be nice when I eventually use it.",
"After ten years of trying to make other tasks lists work, I found this. This nicest part is the amount of integration with other apps I already use: Chrome, Firefox, eM Client calendar.  It's on my Android Tablet and on Android phone.   Reminders are easy, they can be pushed out easily, tagged, multiple comments, attachments, the whole bit.  If you need a task manager that does some heavy lifting, this is it.",
"Having used a variety of To Do tools in the past Todoist is by far the best tool. The use of natural language to enter task scheduling (rather than using a cumbersome drop-down calendar approach) is what makess Todoist a great app. Overall anjoybto use and The reminders are persistent yet not obtrusive, but also  suggest rescheduling uncompleted tasks which were due in the past.",
"Use of this app has resulted in a significant increase in productivity.  I now use it instinctively to quickly schedule actions and tasks, no matter how trivial as they arise so nothing is overlooked. Great at helping you ""eat the frog"" by defining projects and breaking them down into tasks and subtasks. Can provide a summary of your day ahead and a recap of what you achieved that day, which is motivating. You can also use it to timeblock if using the Pomodoro time management technique. Have mine synched to my Huawei band to get notifications and use IFTTT to extend the functionality. Took me only an hour using the free version to see the potential and buy the paid version. Cannot  recommend highly enough as a reformed procrastinator.",
"I use it all day every day. As soon as I hear a due date or make an appointment it goes straight into todoist which syncs with my calendar. I love it. There are a few little bugs here and there but I work around them. For instance if I want to make a reminder at 10am to say ""prepare report for 2pm meeting"" it glitches and moves the reminder to 2pm. I get around this by using Spanish or typing t.w.o.p.m.",
"I read all the reviews and tried tons of alternatives. This is the first time ever, I'm able to have my personals and work tasks on the same platform AND have my work and personal calenders synced. Even made the Productivity tab on my KeyOne relevant again. I swear by this app now",
"Pros:  awesome widget, slick text shortcuts, good availability of apps w/ sync across different platforms, & pro version allows email-to-task creation.  Cons:  poor options for sorting tasks & some of their apps/plugins are buggy and crash occasionally.",
"I used to use Google Tasks with a multidevice app but Android added policies that disabled the app.  This app appears to work well for tracking the numerous things that I plan to do in retirement.   Since my schedule is flexible, I sometimes don't get things done on the intended date.  But the app will reschedule them very easily in as little as one click to shift every thing to the next available date. It mails me a reminder every morning but also puts a notification in the screen space provided by Android.",
This task manager has everything I need from a task manager to the level I use it currently. The only thing I would like is the ability to change a task into a project if I find out it needs multiple steps. Being able to do this with a quick menu button would be a lot nicer for me than deleting the task and creating a project separately.,
"Something happened to the widgets every time we tap it, it asks to choose the view... I'd also wish the first priority tasks would be moved automatically on the top of the list (otherwise the prioritising hasn't got much sense to me) Can we set it up somehow?  EDIT @todoist :  I know we can sort it up that way, but it won't stay sorted. Every new ""first priority"" task goes down the list anyway...",
"Great, simple design I have the basic one but thinking of upgrading. I use this for keeping my business and mind in sync so things get done love it.",
"This simple, clean, intuitive app has become the home for all my lists and projects. I think it's the best app for individual project management - I haven't used any team functionality yet.",
I've been using it for quite a while now and simply love it. Too bad they removed formatting functionality that was available at the beginning...,
Very good productivity application. It is robust enough to be useful and simple enough to be learnable. There are a few things that could be improved (i.e. more intuitive syntax).,
I am now using the mobile app exclusively. The only thing I can't figure out is how to set a recurring date. I love this app. It's so easy to use. The sky is almost the limit.,
"I was skeptical at first, but after watching a tutorial that showed me just how easy it is, I love it! Best to do list app I've ever found",
"My favorite of the ones I've tried, but kind of a shame that a basic feature like attaching notes to an item is reserved for the premium version.",
This has got to be one of the best apps out there for all the productive people.It's easy to use and helps you stay on tracks especially for your dailies.,
I'm extremely busy and this makes it easier to remember everything I have to do. Wish it would be easier to see all of my tasks though - like maybe in a calendar view.,
Simple to use. Great design. Love that it's cross platform.  Would love to also have a free feature to somehow highlight the current tasks I'm working on. I'm guessing I could just label them p1 but that would be hacky.,
"Really straightforward and helpful. Lots of smart features like automatic interpretation of dates. Easy to understand and use right off the bat. I've tried a number of different task managing apps, and this one's the best.",
"Really helpful for both small jobs and big projects. My productivity has  improved massively since I started using this app, it allows you to break down projects into minor tasks which allows to work through them easily.",
Very easy and intuitive to use (free version). I wish it would let me see all my to-do items in calendar format though.,
"I had hoped this app would cover things that liferpg lacks, like setting recurring tasks that have minute intervals. Sadly not, and the interface is very frustrating to use. Uninstalled",
It works just fine. Not sure it's a world beater but I'm working with apple anylist as well and this holds its own,
"I'm a business owner, and the todo app really helps me stay on track for following up and keeping track of appointments I have.",
Far more effective than having to do the notebook thing! Super easy to use and an awesome app for people like myself who have an affinity for list making. Even the free version is great; an uncommon circumstance.,
A lot of the web features are not in the app. For example importing templates. Another thing I'm confused with is how to create new projects and sub projects. Still one of the best Todo apps but with I could have more in my android app,
This is the best organizational or to-do app I have ever used. The email reminders and push notifications are intuitive and helpful.,
Awesome app. I've actually been more productive. Karma points seem silly but work.,
It's a great app.  I was spoiled by IQtell so I miss having email attachments added to tasks. I use it with Newton email.,
"It's easy to use and has great features even as a free app. If it keep impressing after I have used it and purchase it my rating may go up, but I doubt it will lower!",
"Best multi platform task manager I've found and I think I've pretty much tried them all. Great functionality, fast and easy to use - well worth the paid upgrade as well.",
"Excellent and simple. Thought it was strange that I couldn't record voice to a comment like I can with the web, but otherwise great.",
This app is getting me through grad school. Absolutely love it. Recently discovered I can use it with my Google home and my life is so much simpler now. There are a few glitches that I hope will be worked out soon.,
"The developers have revoked some previously available features like auto detection of day and dates from task itself, and so on. Otherwise it is a good app.",
I love the minimalistic design and the ease of use. I wanted a simple app to help remind me if the smaller goals/tasks I wanted to complete throughout the day and so far this has got everything I need. Great app.,
It's a great list making app but a yearly subscription for the pro features is a joke.,
"I downloaded this to use with my Google home since they removed the to do list function and replaced it with Todoist. Should be a basic function of ""add clean garage to my to do list"" along with the ability to have her read back the list. Unfortunately when used with my Google home it is relativity pointless. While it takes note of what I say, half the time it misunderstands. It also will not repeat back my list to me,  there is no way I have found to make separate lists with different names, and the dialogue with the Google home runs on and on meaning I have to wait for it to finish it's song and dance every single time I want to use it. If planning to use with the google home, I do not recommend it.",
Love it.. The only thing so far that is confusing is writing the custom recurrence for the task and not knowing where the completed tasks are (when I need to re-add them someday),
The email part reminds me how I've been wasting away on overdue tasks. Way better than I expected.,
This is the best Todo app out there. It works on all my devices from desktop to iPhone and even integrates to dashclock! Love it!,
"I installed it in my mobile,  in Firefox and chrome, but the synchronization didn't occur. I was using the same Gmail account. When I started to use it, all was going on right. But later, in each one appeared  a different date. Then, if I added something in Firefox it didn't show up in my mobile (Samsung active 7). I'm testing it again. Soon a new review.",
Easy to use.  Great features. So nice to have a place to record all of my tasks. I like that it lets me quickly refer back to them and keeps me on track.,
"Great app, but I miss the interactive audio of wunderlist and Microsoft todo. Think about rewarding me with a little pip.",
"Every bloody thing is a premium feature. If you're not very keen to pay for it, do not install.",
Love it. Beautiful and easy to use. I have it synced with my Google Home and set up an IFTTT formula to quickly add items to my grocery and chores lists. Easy collaboration.,
"Bar none the best productivity app in existence. A small learning curve to be sure, but it really opens up possibilities the more you learn about how to use todoist. Get it. Use it. And use premium.",
"It Should tell you from the start of this page that half the time you tap on anything it'll pop up with a message,""ya need the gosh dang premium""",
"I really like it, and it helps me stay on task. Just wish it didn't have a premium version that cost money.",
"Very robust and yet very intuitive and easy to use. If you want the most out of it (and you definitely do) search around the web for some tips, tricks and 'hidden' features. Pure 5 and well worth the premium upgrade.",
Todos done right. This is a polished product with flexibility to meet any scenario. Adaptable to nearly any workflow and will enable you to reach new goals in productivity!,
Almost like it. But I cannot find how to set repeated/recurring  task,
Amazing. So helpful for staying organised. Would definately recommend buying premium - it's just worth the extra accessibility for ~£2.33 a month,
I really like this app. It helps keep me on task however a couple of the features I could really utilize cost extra. All-in-all its working for me.,
Good program.  Not so straight forward to learn icons and nuance of schedualing.,
So many good features on this app!  Love being able to collaborate on a project but also assign specific tasks to different people so that they don't all show up on my to do list.,
"Honestly, It's the only thing that keeps all of my many tasks organized.",
I've been using todoist for almost 10 years. Still the best todo app out there.,
You won't regret buying a subscription for this service. Todoist + your favorite calendar app (regardless of whether or not you decide to sync across them) is the ultimate productivity combo.,
Excellent cross platform task management application.  Simple to use and clean UI. 5 star rating from me 👍👌,
"Pretty impressed so far, integrates nicely with ifttt and Google home. Good enough to pay for but £28 a year is too steep for the features I'd actively use.",
It's my favorite to do list. You can do so much with it it's insane.,
Great app to manage tasks by date/priority/category or a mix. Link to google calendar and syncing is great,
"Very intuitive. Amazing user experience. Projects, labels and filters are mind blowing features. Paid version is absolute value for money.",
"It's super easy to get into, and even features that are hidden below are easy to use! The only thing I wish was included is more priority options, 4 can be a bit limiting sometimes!",
"Latest version of the widget (2017-12-23 release) keeps asking me to choose a view. Todoist has no bug reporting facility, even for paid users. Still a good product though...",
It keeps all my thoughts in one place. I can focus on what needs doing because I'm not spending my brain power trying to remember  WHAT I need to do! Thank you!,
Very good application. Just a shame about the blue icons.,
Have been using this service for over a decade. It gets better all the time. Great product.,
Suppose it is one of the best to do apps for android but it's still pretty dire.,
"This app helps me manage all aspects of my life, and is so easy to use!",
Good for a very simple app. Not many features but if you want very solid basics this app is for you.,
You can easily get your work done by this app,
I finally can feel like I am getting things done and can relax.,
Barely used it. Alarms didn't work when I set them. It looks neat but meh..,
"Bloated, annoying emails and notifications and obfuscated UI.",
You should create a better karma. The karma could be by project. And could visualize the number of tasks by the weekday.,
Great for my scattered brain! Keeps me on track.,
Love it.  Early flows between all of my devices and works with amazon echo which is brilliant.  😊,
"Brilliant app, helping me make it through the final year of Uni!",
Pretty good! The sync across multiple devices is awesome and adding new goals is easy!,
the layout could be more colorful but otherwise it's a great app..,
Liked the app but it did not allow for recurring tasks.   Maybe it is the premium version.,
Great app and has what you need and more. Also a great tech support dept.,
Great easy tool for keeping a list between many devices. Intuitive to use,
Finding this a really useful way to manage my life.  Multitasking made easy,
Great app synced with my computer too. Multiple lists simultaneously.,
"Very efficient system for organizing tasks by project, deadline, and priority.",
"GTD works well with Todoist. App is friendly, easy to use.",
Great app that helps me to remember what I need to do,
It has all what it needs to help to achieve the goals and to organize your life,
"Doesn't want to sync the app on mobile with web app anymore, even if sync is forced...",
Happy paid pro user for two years. Best when using filters instead of lists of lists,
Good app to track down the things what you forget to do.,
good wish compleated ting did not disaper also should make a satisying noise when I get somthing done,
It does a pretty nice job for me  Even the non paid version is far better than traditional method of carrying a diary,
Easy to use . Good reminders. First month excellent,
"Всё удобно, особенно радуют вложения во вложения,спасибо!",
Excellent.  This is a tightly focused incredibly useful app.,
Simple to use yet able to handle the complex workload of a teacher!,
It's one of the best to improve the management of your daily goals,
Slick interface and nice looks on the wall and it works with Google home.,
Seems the perfect way round google home limitations.,
It's great helps me a lot,
Love using Alexa to add groceries to my shopping list.,
Multiple platforms support make this product daily usable.,
Nice to do list that allows collaborators and sub tasks.,
So good for bisness. But need to pay.,
Very easy to set up and use.,
Best app I've found for this stuff,
Simple to use and gets the job done perfectly,
Easy to use and great for sharing tasks with a group,
Really good app that helps me a lot,
Great way of organizing and it has reminders too,
Great app.helps to plan the day as I'm a Student,
Never had issues with this App. Good App,
Great app for someone who has ADD!,
"Must log in to account, most main features are premium; require payment to use.",
Great app for day to day task management.,
Brilliant app. It is lightning quick to use.,
Easy and simple. Not too much going on,
Works well to keep me on track!,
Great app for productivity and being more effective.,
Good to keep a track of activities and results,
Great for making shopping lists with alexa,
"Fast, stable and useful. Kudos for Todos.",
"The most basic need, like a reminder is a ""Pro,"" feature.  Sucks",
"""reminders are a premium feature"", ""premium is a $30 yearly subscription"". For a checklist app. 2018 everyone. The future is now.",
"Helpful, practical easy to use",
Easy to use and works well.,
Best application for todo works.,
Excellent app to get organised ❤,
Great tool for busy moms.,
The best to-do list app I've tried.,
Epic. Best GTD app ever.,
Easy to use. Helpful for organizing.,
Good Tool for Goal Tracking...,
Brilliant app. Best one I've tried.,
"Good to-do list tool, I like it.",
Really? Reminders are not for free? You are lucky that Microsoft is shutting down Wunderlist.,
Life changing!,
Very useful app!,
Really useful app.,
I love the app!,
Great app!,
good app!,
Love this app/website,
One less star because of the notification process,
Very easy to use :),
Great for productivity!,
It's good.,
Good apps.,
It's great,
Great app.,
Simple & easy.,
Very nice...,
It's a nice,
No reminders for free account?!,
Convenient and reasonably priced,
Just amazing brilliant,
Interesting and useful app,
Very very useful,
Useful for daily activities,
Love it.,
The standard for task management,
"It works wonders!!! I have the paid version, which I think is worth it. If you need to keep people on task this is the way! I use it with Slack all the time",
Very impressive,
handy and simple,
Life changer,
Easy to use,

Amazing,
Good,
Great,
Efficient,
Everything is premium,
Offers pretty decent functionality despite being free. Premium adds so much more good stuff that are useful to me (especially labels). Has really high customisation availability compared to other to-do apps I use. Good integration with the GTD system too.  What it needs is better integration with Google Calendar. The built in integration did not work that well for me as it forces two way integration with no choice to opt out for one direction. Resorted to using ifttt for the time being.,
"It's a very good app and service.   Yes the fact that it is a subscription service for the premium stuff is a bit annoying, but understandable.   The only down side to the app is that if I have switched from one project to another, pressing the back button will just exit the app, since it sees all projects as equal, it would be nice if it went back to either the previously open project, or the inbox.   Overall however, great app",
"Look no further: Todoist is hands down all the task management tools you need, and then some. I feel qualified to judge, having given each of its competitors fair test drives. This app & service is a pleasure to use and useful beyond measure. Todoist is a testament to what a bit of vision and persistence can achieve in the digital world. Congratulations guys and don't stop making me glad I chose you.",
"Good. Nearly, but not quite great app. Using the free app works well as a simple to do list. Project/ task/ subtask structure is good. Integration with Google calendar work OK as a display. Could be improved with more granularity of projects to integrate (rather than all / one). Adding start date to tasks (maybe for the premium version) would also add a star to my rating.",
"Ive been using paid todoist for years. It is my favorite note app but I also store other information I can share lists with others. The free app is also awesome and those I share lists with only have the free app.  Besides shopping lists, I use todoist to keep household I formation such as air filter sizes, paint colors, dimensions of things, etc. It syncs across all devices and the app is available for all devices, desktops, internet browser plugins, & and phone/tables.",
"Clearly does what I need. I was a little confused at the start about what was a project and what was a label but I guess I over thought it. I wonder if tips could be turned on for beginners... Like a tutorial or wizard to ask questions to set up functionality. I think most people would just reuse something simple that works. Getting productive is the idea, misuse the app and you're just busy.",
"It's simply effective for a making a quick list for things that we need to do today or any other days in the future. The fact that it has its own calendar, cool layout and so easy to operate and get myself familiarise with every feature provided.",
"The interface, usability etc is quite good. But I felt it to be useless until you get the premium features. In the simple package you cannot even set reminders or add notes. But once you get the Premium features its hands down the best to do app.",
"It's not an all in one package, but to be honest nothing exists like that yet. And maybe everyone needs something different and a complete life management system is too difficult to make for more than one person. This tool will facilitate tracking and remembering the action items you have to do on a specific day or at a specific time and also the next action items you can do during any discretionary time you might have. I still use manilla folders and a labeler for projects support files that I need to give to people in person. I'm also not satisfied with managing any project information in this app, other than simple association to know what an action is for. And I track my ""someday/maybe"" items, ""waiting for"" items, and triggers elsewhere. But when used in an already working personal productivity system that is your own, this app is the bee's knees for managing simple physical actions. So despite all the negativity I just gave it, I use this app every single day and wouldn't use anything else. It makes sense, as most of what we do everyday are just a bunch of simple actions. I've only have success when I track one action for each project. Just a tip. That's why I manage projects elsewhere. Only the very next action for each project goes in todoist, for me.",
"Loved the app until my tasks ended up deleted... No undo, and auto backup is a PREMIUM function. In the middle of making Christmas Presents on Dec 23 (I know my fault so late) and huge parts of my list vanishes!!  Did not like spending tonight stressed and rushed, because I couldnt remember what I had to do.",
"Sorry, 1 star was uncalled for, but the timezones thing is super confusing.... how many people really know their Time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time GMT ??  Some direction is called for in that error pop-up ...   Right off the bat asks cryptic question : 'change time zone to GMT - 7: 00' what the heck is that? Why would I want to change the time zone on my phone? it's tied into the appropriate time and works fine...  And if you do want to change the timezone why wouldn't you just say Mountain standard time or Pacific Standard Time why make it super confusing....",
"My favorite productivity app. I tried others, like Trello, and Evernote (I still use Evernote for other things) but they didnt have the features I needed, or the features were inconvenient and ineffecient. Todoist resolves all the issues i had with other apps.",
"Love the app. Would love it more if it would remember my sorting option and automation sort accordingly. When I enter and prioritize a new task, I don't want to constantly go back and resort to group my prioritized takes together",
"Fantastic app for applying GTD principles, very powerful.  My only problem is I can't use it for work.  Totally worth the price.",
I really enjoy Todoist. It is a great platform that syns to my emails and keeps me on track. I won't deny that the subscription is very expensive and I wish there was some way to just have a one off payment or no to have to pay at all!,
"Tried this versus AnyDo, and it wins, for me. Both great apps, but Todoist is easily searchable, plus integrates with Zapier...I just created a sweet new business process which will probably make it hard for me to leave Todoist because of this. Great work, thanks guys!",
This app has been really useful. Perfect for jotting down all the things that I need to do during the week. Even useful for making future wish lists and project planning,
"Great app! Easy to use on phone, tablet, ChromeBook,  and desktop.    The only thing that I feel this app is missing; is a dark theme option.  I'll never understand why software developers don't make this a standard option. The white backgrounds kill your eyes.",
"Its like a powerpack to keep you on track. It helped me alot to schedule my assignments, projects, submission and other personal works.",
"I've been using it for 20 weeks now. This is an excellent way to unload the tasks that are on your mind so you can think about other things and be in the moment. I use it on IPhone, outlook, win 10 and Android. It always stays in sync no matter how I access it. This app is my trusted place to put my tasks.",
"Excellent to do list and task manager which syncs with multiple devices and 
Google calendar, you do have to pay for all the features like comments for 
tasks.",
"This app is amazing when it comes to keeping track of your assignments. It also is useful for things like personal reminders. I love this app, no doubt about that !",
"Tried them all.  If you can't keep it all in your head, this is the best.  Well worth paying for premium features.",
"The most reliable, flexible task management app as per my knowledge. I have try any.do before, not as comprehensive as Todoist. I employ GTD approach and working well for me so far.",
"Juggling as many projects as I do takes either a great memory or a great list system. Todoist has made me very successful at the juggle, despite my ADD.",
"Very intuitive interface. User friendly and simple to pick up, but also deep and nuanced when you take the time to interview yourself in the features. I couldn't handle life without it!",
Single best productivity tool I have ever used. I've been a premium user  for several years and will continue to pay for this app without even a second thought.,
I started using it for day to day tasks which I forget easily and Todoist has helped a lot so far. Looking forward to use it for projects as well!,
"Makes my life handy... When I remember something at home, at the gym or in the office I just introduce the task and it synchronizes with all devices. Really love it and I recommend it to anyone",
"Intuitive.  Good simplified alternative to OmniFocus.  -1 for 1. Tech Support. Lacking.  Not really interested in solving your problem and 2. For annual fee versus 1 time pay.  Makes it  more expensive than OmniFocus   Otherwise, I would given it 5 stars.",
I have tried many task apps and Todoist is by far my favorite. It integrates with many other apps and services and has an excellent interface.,
"Great to manage your time, you can make sub tasks which is a really useful tool. Better than anything I used before. Recommend this 100%!",
The app is working great without flaws. You need to try it out on all your devices to understand how it helps with your daily life.,
"Free version can have few more features. Just a wish. One time purchase can be offered for personal uses. Otherwise, excellent software.",
Really good app best functioning to-do list app I've seen now if only I could use it consistently or probably help me out a lot,
"Does not link up with google calendar, which would be useful for copying an event as a todo/task and for viewing my todo on gcalendar",
Just what I needed... Keeps me focused in getting the intraday adjenda done & importantly a handy tool in delegating micro tasks.,
"Great app. Does everything I want, and a bunch of things I didn't even know I wanted.",
Love it greatest part is that you are accountable for the things you don't do. You can see if your progress it lack thereof.,
"The interface is powerful, but cluttered. But the inability to do something as basic as adding notes to a task without buying the pro version is a killer for me.",
It's a great way to keep tab on all tasks. It would have been better had the free features were more.,
App works great. Not so much for Google Assistant integration. Very finnicky and doesn't accept basic commands like what's do I need to complete tomorrow (instead saying what I need to complete today).,
Helps me stay organised and keeps me on top of things in getting them done. One of the best out there.,
"Works lovely with Google home via IFTTT, and the widget is awesome (especially for teams or spouses), but it's pricy, and eventually, I turned to gtasks - better value for my needs.",
App has improved since my last review. I like how it gives feedback on how I'm doing with completing tasks. Would be nice if back button goes to homepage instead of exiting out.,
Nothing spectacular. The free tier Lacks functionality and the premium tier is expensive for what it is. Easy task entry and the fact that they have apps on all platforms (incl desktop) are the only big positives about todoist.,
Really solid app that integrates well across platforms. I love being able to add items via Amazon Alexa.,
So simple - love the widget on my phone so I can see and manage to dos without opening the app. Rescheduling tool is also helpful.,
I live by Todo lists. This is one of the best that I've tried. The website feature is great and the fact that I can see my lists on multiple handhelds is super. Thanks!,
"I really like it. There's a couple things missing that I wished it had (such as star, start dates). But overall I'm very happy with it.",
"Since i discovered this app,  it has helped me stay on track with my plans and activities..  I love the app so much.  Thanks for bringing such an app to us.",
"I do like this app, it is a good to do list. I just wish there was some comedy built in to the app when completing the list. Like either rewards, achievements, or perhaps unlock themes as you use the app more, etc.",
"Been using for three plus years.  Started out as a very useful tool, now it's great. The only mobile app I pay for, because it's worth it!",
"Thoughtful design, well cross platform synchronization. It's easy to use once you understand what key info (date, time in semantic terms) to type in, the system will capture the info for you.",
"It's very easy to use, I'm a somewhat forgetful person and this is helping me.",
"Simple and works. That's apparently hard to find among these apps, so I'm giving it a perfect score. Will probably use this for a while.",
It's quite useful and I like it because I can just reschedule tasks that I was unable to complete very easily without having to rewrite them as I would normally do. It also keeps me way more organized.,
"I love that I can break my to dos up by project, and assign ""child"" tasks to break up larger tasks. I wish the reminders were part of the free version instead of restricted to the premium version",
Good solid todo manager I think there should be some middle ground on cost between a professional user and free for a super home user. No sharing and include comments and hopefully notifications no allocations to other users for $5 dollars a year,
"The integration with Outlook made Outlook very slow, so the app in general was unusable for me.",
Quickly found out you have to pay 29/yr for the app to be anything worthwhile. Will delete after submitting this review.,
"Great , just wish all the extra helpfuls weren't premium. Other than that, cool app",
The best thing about todos is that it have a goto widget which allows instant access to your task list and mark as well.,
I wish Wunderlist wasn't dead. But this is a pretty good replacement. Too many ads/upsells,
I shouldn't need to create an account just to use this app. All I need is a simple to-do list app.,
"Superior in flexibility (including merging work and personal activities) over any.do, but needs more work providing contextual options. It's UI is still too reliant on a top-down organizational structure that I can't always figure out. It's web page interface needs to improve its synchronization like providing a warning before closing the page if the webpage has still not submitted my multiple changes.",
"I've always been organised but this makes it even easier, very helpful and intuitive and I like the karma points",
Great app but should be able to repeat tasks weekly on a specific day/have more options to schedule tasks.,
"Easy to use, intuitive. Tool process does not get in the way. Works for business and home all in one",
Good for reminders. I'd like to be able to do an overall view and set hourly timetables  though,
Great app  I use it for everything. Very few bugs.,
"Really helpful woth managing a large number of tasks, especially with smart scheduling",
Todoist has made keeping track of things easy.  Great app,
"You need the ""Pro"" version to get reoccurring reminders. Eat my shorts! Uninstalled!",
Easy to use. Just moved from MS Outlook tasks and is so much slicker and interconnected across platforms.,
"Makes me feel so much more organized!  I use it for every list, every time.",
Brilliant App. I have been using it for a year now and find it essential for my day to day functioning.,
Are time based reminders broken when adding a task now? Eg typing 3h or 20min. Pretty sure this used to exist—and it exists on desktop for sure,
"Helpful, but wish u didn't have to upgrade to get all features.",
I've been using todoist for about 10 days now and very satisfied with its functionality.,
"Great apps! If there is timesheet, it will be more fantastic",
Super user-friendly and smart yet extremely simple. Projects function incredibly helpful,
Really good! Still figuring out the functionality. Google Assistant integration is pretty dang cool.,
Great for reminding me what I need. Very handy,
"Simple interface, yet powerful features.  It has everything I need.  Love it!",
"Really helps me organize my tasks,  works great on all my devices!",
"Great app! Extensive but intuitive! Would recommend to anyone looking for a new ""to-do"" list system!",
So helpful. Best to do list I have ever had!,
This app has made me so much more organized.,
Love this app. Helped to track the stuff which I would have forgotten otherwise.,
A Property company that my company werks along with we share this app werks great. Thank you.,
Super easy to add tasks. Actually helpful in keeping track of tasks without being a burden.,
"Used this app about 3 months now, loving the priority feature and the clean menu.",
"Great app, helps me stay on track. Bought premium version.",
"Efficient, good integration with Chrome on desktop. Best to do app since Astrid",
"Just what I needed. Quick to enter todos, check off when done, sort by priority.",
Very useful for keeping track of tasks and rearranging them if necessary.,
Easy to use. Love that it's available on every platform. Love the natural language entry.,
Great app! Makes my day orgenized and its easy to use,
Couldn't het it to work. Waste of time,
cons: Only yearly subscription,
Love how simple and minimalistic it is. Got to test it yet with bigger projects though.,
That's a beautiful app for those who love organization et efficiency on work,
Great for helping me plan my week and not forget key things to do!,
Try it for 5 minutes. I did and still use it a year later. Simple. Works.,
I use it as a basic to do list to remind me and it is great,
Great tool when you have allot to remember on different fronts,
"This is a fantastic app, and the desktop app synchronization helps out  lot too",
What good is a task management app if it cannot give reminders,
"Easy to use, but powerful if you want to take advantage of all the features",
Really good for the family or friends that need a app to manage a to do list that sinks together between devices,
It meets all my needs I love the ability to sync with other apps and device s,
"If you love/need to make lists, this is the app for you.",
Premium version is great. Unfortunately I cannot recommend free version.,
"Great app, really useful - even just the free version.",
This helped me get my life into order!,
Quick to learn how to do it and using for things to do. Ace interface,
Best Getting Things Done app!,
Great app to get things done.,
"Nice integration with another services, synchronization works also good",
This is the correct tool to be using post-wunderlist :),
Todoist is a great app that makes it easy to track everyday tasks.,
"Works well, easy to use, no glitches so far.",
It works quite well. The interface is simple and intuitive.,
"Simple to-list app... good for personal use. But, I think not so much for team.",
A huge help in accomplishing my daily tasks,
The best to do list app out there,
Excellent App. Makes task-management very simple.,
"Super app, I recommend. Easy and efficient 😉",
One of the better task and project tools at a low cost.,
Best app I use! Saves my life... It's my external brain.,
Superb task tool. Syncs well,
Wonderful application helping to organize time. Very inspiring and motivating.,
Great app. Very helpful in organising day to day tasks,
Favorite to do list if all time,
Husband and I like that we can share,
Quick to learn and deep features as you go on,
Perfect app to follow and complete tasks on track,
"Did what i wanted, nothing spectacular",
Keeps me so organized and when necessary reorganized!,
Supplements the web app very nicely.,
Very great App for the absent minded person.,
You can use it as well as you you wish to,
It does what it's meant to do.,
All good features are in premium mode,
Love the ability to share lists easily,
Good app that helps with my schedule,
Helps keep me focus and on track,
Very well designed and easy to use,
A great app to organise yourself,
It's just helpful. That's all I have to say about that.,
Very helpful. Soon to be enlightened.,
"A better TO DO list, it's that simple!",
This app keeps me sane.,
So far so good! Great app.,
Nice app. Simple and effective,
"Simple design, flexible functionality",
Excellent app for making plans.,
"It's a really helpful tool, easy to use.",
Still exploring the app...but happy with it thus far.,
Really like its features.,
Great tool to not forget!,
This app help me to keep track of my projects.,
It has increased my productivity...,
One of my todoist is to finish everything in my todoist!,
"My life, in many lists.",

It's one of the best,
Tastes like Snickers.,

Todoist has been a lifesaver! I've got dozens of projects/reports going all the time and it has kept me on task and on time! Thanks Todoist!,

"Избавляет от стресса четкость планирования с этим приложением. А функция раздачи поручений помощникам вообще делает его классным - отпала необходимость напоминаний людям о задачах, оно их долбит само)",
,
"I have been using this valuable app for nearly a month now. It is really useful and helps me effectively organise my tasks. Just one note.. Organising a task with a specific time put out directly on top of the list, even before the highest-priority tasks. Sometimes this is unnecessary. It is a great app in general and I enjoy using it..",
"This could be good but it is designed for working people who are working on multiple projects with multiple people. It's designed in such a way that it's not useful for anyone else. Google doesn't give me enough space here to explain what I mean. You could jerry rig this to make it work for simple to do lists, but with all the to do apps out there, there's no reason to do that. The repetitive mentions of ""to do"" are not intentional :).",
"Thanks to Todoist, and its powerful simplicity I have become increasingly efficient both at work and at home.  Instead of trying to remember every little intention I have I immediately add it to Todoist (and to OneNote for history using IFTTT).  I do probably 50 percent MORE overall 'things' now.  Thanks Todoist Team!",
"I have tried most of the todo apps on the market, including toodledoo, nozbe, trello, jira, asana etc.     For me, todoist is the perfect combination of structure and flexibility for my use. Very east to implement gtd systems with projects and contexts. It works great on both android and web (it seems all functionality is in both places), and the premium version is affordable enough for home use.    Very easy to create hiearchies such as subproject and different projects for work and private, while at the same time being able to create queries and views across all folders.   Possible to perform searches for just the subprojects of a given project, so you can ask for all the next actions for just work or just home.   Very easy to share projects/lists with others.  Good reminder feature.  If I have to point at anything negative, it would the lack of recursive sharing, and the fact that there is no suggestion/tab-complete when defining folter queries. Took a bit of research to find the query syntax, but was easy once I found it.",
"Todoist replaced my scattered to do lists on post it notes, with the added bonus of giving me ""karma points"" for getting things done. It was a ridiculously motivating way to get me hooked, and now I will never go back to post its.",
Simple tool for organizing your business and personal tasks.  It needs to make filters and recurrent options easy through selecting from windows or dropdown lists without the need to type specific rules.  Solving this problem will make it the greatest.,
"I love this app.  I have only had for 3 days and still trying to get the hang of it, but it seems to be so simple to learn.",
"Ive been using it for a long time now on Android, windows and Pebble. One of the most comprehensive platforms and its really smart. You can forget about it when you don't need it but really intuitive when you do use it. Great work and pleasing design.",
"Pretty basic features in free version. Like the UI/UX tho. Need more advanced time/project manager features: Task description/notes, status (waiting, delegated, in progress), progress board (to-do/in progress, done, custom), task's labor intensity in hours, Gannt timeline/calendar, open plan for ANY day in future. Also, android back button quits app where it should not. Not all important features present across Android/Pc/web. Will keep looking for a more advanced app (something more like Jira)",
Good for getting yourself going after a long streak of inactivity. I'd never use the premium options on subscriptions. Give me a chance for a one time purchase and I might go for it. 2020 update: lack of reminders without a subscription is a nonstarter.,
Great multi platform task management program that works well for teams.  I love the free version and plan to purchase the reasonably prices paid version.,
Only app my family uses for sharing tasks besides SMS. This is better than text messaging because of the level of organisation it brings.,
"It's simple and easy to use. Just that if I can have a log to check when did I completed things, it definitely can have a full star rating! Keep it up ❤",
Not sure why I use this app over other ones I've tried but this one actually has me following through with things I need to do. Been using for a month now and my productivity has shot up,
"Best productivity app around - you need the premium version to fully appreciate what the app offers, but it's excellent value for money.",
Please make REMAINDER feature free. Without remainder this app is not competitive from other apps like Any do. Please Add this feature.We all are looking for this .,
"Todoist is great for basic day-to-day to-do lists, and for more complicated projects. Recommended for anyone who prefers an electronic to-do list.",
Very nice features at the paid level. The only to-do list app that has actually helped me to get organized and keep track of all the little day-to-day responsibilities.,
"Makes my work life less complicated by tracking all the to-dos and also helps me by notifying the upcoming calls, meetings and time sensitive tasks.",
Simply the best to do list app available.  Great customization with alarms and reminders and organization.  Very person. It truly feels like your to do list not a cut and past of everyone else's just with your tasks.  A very smart input setting. That is very fast. Easy to use and understand and it keeps you extremely organized!,
I love Todoist but I have to report a syncing issue. Tasks marked completed on my Outlook extension are updating the online version however are not being synced with the Android app. I'm using a OnePlus phone.,
"Good, but too many features are locked behind the premium subscription. I understand a company has to make money, but I would rather at least some of the features be available to unlock for a one time price, such as color customization. I would definitely pay for that, but the subscription model is preventing me from doing that.",
"Great app! Helps planning ahead, and made the organization of each day so much easier. It made me much more efficient, wouldn't want to miss it!",
"I have worked with other to-do application for years, and after tried this one I really can see how much more this excellent tool can give. Thanks for introducing me with GTD.",
"If used correctly this is a very powerful organising tool. It's especially good for making sure you get all of those obscure, one off items off your to do list",
"For a free to do list app it's great, you can have multiple lists, set things to do, it makes me organised without feeling stressed - one of my most used apps",
"Great app, a little hard to get used to using it consistently but that had nothing to do with the app.",
"Has genuinely helped me become more productive. Incredibly useful, now I couldn't live without it",
Great app. Takes a minute to get used to the tagging and deadlines. But once I got the hang of it I was creating tasks every chance I got.,
This app is so easy to use. You have as much control as I could possible want over organizing tasks.,
Amazing app. I'm a the end of my free 30 days trial and I will surely pay for the premium. It's my favorite Todo app so far it integrates well with many other apps (such as Trello which we use at work).,
"I've been a productivity fanatic for years. I've tried dozens of tools and Todoist is, by far, the best todo list app I've found. Todoist strikes an excellent balance between ease of use, functionally and availability on all platforms.",
"excellent app. The free version is quite limited, but okay for basic use.",
"The only TODO app I've ever used for more than a few weeks. It's easy, it's intuitive, I can separate tasks out by projects yet see what I have to do next easily.",
"This app has become crucial to my productivity, I use it everyday. One  thing is the lack of colours for projects, would be nice if there were some more colors.",
"Really great app. Love the ability to reschedule any task. Love the tags, just wish you did have to pay for them. The yearly cost minimal compared to others and it does interface with Alexa so it might worth a try.",
Wonderful. I dont like the karma thing and would like to take it off. Otherwise its great.,
"Love this app, I use it for small tasks I don't want to forget (pick up milk) and for project management, very flexible and incredibly useful!",
"Killer to do list, best I've tried and might be best 30£ spent on store. Work amazingly on phone and pc. A bit more integration with slack or Evernote would be amazing to fit into my work flow.",
Great app in terms of functionality but the UI isn't there most intuitive.,
I usually forgot my daily tasks but Since I installed the app my life has been simplified.,
I found it very useful when arrived back in school and for remembering tasks that i would personally not remember.,
"Doesn't have a feature to sort tasks. I mean, it sort of does, but the only workaround is to tap Menu &gt; Sort &gt; Priority (or however you'd like to sort) after adding any task. Also, if you accidentally complete the wrong task or tasks, you have to subscribe to premium to see your history. Doesn't seem worth it.",
"Pretty good imo, it suits my style of working, would love to have a place to see everything you finished",
"App works flawlessly, definitely helps with getting things done. Love it.",
I wish I had known of this app earlier. Push notifications and SMS messages to notify of tasks is a life saver to get me to my tasks without procrastinating any further.,
Really great for people who find themselves forgetting their to dos - when you think of something you need to do it takes 5 seconds to put it into the app so you'll be reminded,
"Simple and effective. Reminders are great, great tool for planners and those who have to manage multiple tasks every day.",
"I love this app, and I would love it more if it could sync the tasks with Samsung calendar is form of tasks and not like events",
"Easy to note on the fly, later assign a priority, and then follow up. Rewards also help. 5 stars",
"Simple to use, clear displays, not over-fussy. I find it a real help for keeping track of tasks.",
Its very convenient and simple.Helps keep track of things my family always forgets,
The app is great. Have you ever thought about being able to transform a notification into a reminder? That would be very useful,
"Pretty simple to use and straightforward, but could use a couple of more configurability options, to see default list more quickly",
Todoist is a great set of tools if you want to organize your to-dos and augment your calendar.,
Update to how tasks due dates are scheduled is causing major issues.,
Sad it doesn't have reminders in free edition...just a basic ask,
Every feature is asking for premium account. Even alarm reminder is not available for free. Now useful.,
I love the fact that t sweetness you emails when you forgot what you were supposed to do yesterday,
Don't lose track of things I want/the wife wants done ;),
"Enjoy the simple UI and capabilities. Will recommend to colleagues, family and friends.",
"Very nice app. Identifies the date or schedule based on written Todo, which is very helpful.",
"I've used this app for four years, and it has served me well!",
Makes keeping a to-do list easy and always at my fingertips.,
clean design - love the prioritization - awesome cross-platform compatibility!,
"Seems to check all the boxes of a good, sharable project list.",
Great To-Do app! I've felt my personal productivity increase when I integrated this into my life.,
Gets the job done without much hassle. Loving the reminder by email feature.,
Very useful application. Hope you're keep improving it !,
It is great but the free version is not enought. The premium is the best.,
Very easy and efficient way on marking down what you've done and what needs to.,
Fantastic. It gathers all good features of all other task management apps.,
Love todoist! Super practical way to keep your life organized and has lots of integrations,
"Full of useful features and is easy to use and well designed, also the cross platform support is useful",
The best to do list ever...i have tried a lot different ones,
So easy to stay on top of regular tasks I have to do each week.,
Clean interface and reasonable pricing for premium. My go to platform for task management,
Very useful app for people who always forget something important at end of day,
Nice app.. help me to get my tasks sorted,
Great app. I like the reminders it gives you to keep you honest,
"I really liked this app, it's useful and practical",
"Literally perfect, nothing wrong with it.",
It's amazing. Changed my life,
Task manager that is very intuitive. Predictive text works great,
It's an amazing platform that makes life easier and increases productivity,
Very useful for email response management when used in conjunction with IFTTT.,
Very helpful app! Very clean and slick.,
"Great app, very helpful and efficient.",
Easy to use and sync to other mobile devices,
It's good app for planning and help to improve the productivity,
Clear interface. Encourages progress. Helps with prioritizing.,
Good. But cant sync with my office internal network,
My life would be in shambles without todoist.,
This app helps you be effective every day.,
Loving it so far.  Been using it a week.,
"Great app, cool way to organize my tasks",
Easy to use and keeps me in check in my tasks.,
Great app but it doesn't sync Properly,
Like it. Keeps me informed about my projects..,
"Does the job, helps everyday management in a simple way",
Not been using long enough to give 5 stars but it all works and has helped get tasks done,
It is amazing helps you keep on top of your tasks.,
I use it everyday to prioritize my daily tasks.,
Setting out with it. So far matches my expectations,
Been looking for an app that does it all (including sub-tasks) and found it in Todoist,
Great stuff. Using it everyday to keep track of task,
Best project management to do list!,
Simple to do list with broad classification.,
Excellent app. Like the rescheduling feature,
Does everything you'd need from a to do app.,
Really helps me focus my productivity,
Great. Simple. Works as expected. Keeps me organized. Across Multiple Devices... Thanks Todoist,
Sehr gut für alles mögliche,
Awesome. This app change my life,
"Must have app, I use it everyday",
Best to list app so far,
Ties nicely to my outlook and smartphone,
Excellent app that keeps you on task,
"Best aap becoz its remember a lot of work at one time and also a  alarm system was great  .., I do my every work without miss any event .......becoz I have a app wo remember my work....love it aap thanks a lot.....",
No one can expect an app with out remainders for this sort of an apps,
Love this app!  Use it all the time!,
Best productivity app around.,
It's good and quite practical,
Easy to use. Very organized,
"Quick, easy to use planner",
Awesone app to help keep track.,

"Worthless. Contacted ""support"" through the app over a week ago, and still no reply. I paid for the year, but I will be cancelling it, as paying to have basic features on this app is a ripoff for the customer. Crazy to think I paid and still get no support. Go with another app and save yourself the money an the hassle of Todoist. THANKS. UPDATE: THEY HAVE FINALLY REPLIED, SO UP TO 4 STARS, AS AT LEAST THEY GOT BANK TO ME.",
"The best Todo app I've used, and I've used a lot. The premium is worth it, and actually only with it you get all the important features. Great for GTD. So easy to add tasks on the go. Some small abilities are missing in Todoist and seem kind of basic, so this is a little bit annoying, but the pros beat the cons. Anyway, worth trying the premium since it has money back guarantee.",
"The free version is somewhat limited, and there are other apps that give you Todoist's paid features for free. However, I still use Todoist because of the natural language processing and the ability to use symbols while typing a task name to assign it to a project and add a label or priority. Eliminating extra clicks really speeds things up. The Google assistant integration seals it for me, but the limited features are still a bummer during those times when it would be really useful to have a paid feature like task comments.",
"Been looking for this todo list app all my life. Love it love it love it. Quick entry, quick scheduling and rescheduling of items on your list. The projects feature integrates really well with the main list. It's fast, which is the most important thing if I'm actually going to use the app. Thanks developers, you killed it with this one.",
"Everything is awesome about this app, the layout is simpler but elegant to see.. when there too many items its UI handles it easily no strain on eye. But one thing I would like if it implements the feature.. when a new reminder notification comes it's doesn't repeat continuously until I check the notification, this is only feature I think it should have.",
Nice UI and layouts. I appreciate all the features you get with the free version. The integration with Google assistant is a bit messy having to switch back and forth with Google assistant and todoist (a word I find difficult to pronounce!) and therefore makes the app a little too frustrating for me to continue to use.,
"Free version is useless with no place to put details. I thought I would try it out with planning for an upcoming trip, but I can't even add a simple packing list without making each item a separate task. If all I wanted was a calendar/reminder, I already have several. On to the next app.",
"This is a good app and it has helped me be more proactive. Unlike a paper list, I'm less likely to lose my phone. The only con for me I would say is that unlike a paper list I can't see the tasks I have completed, because seeing what I've accomplished motivates me more than seeing just the mountain of work I have to do. Still a good app.",
"The app is amazing and makes syncing easy for PC and Mobile Device. I love it! Just one thing ToDoist, the free version is a bit limited (like that of notifications) and the premium is quite costly. My request is that if you could set up different kinds of packages available providing few basic services too. Else is nice.",
"This app is amazing! It's constantly reminding me of the things I forget to do. It's a very helpful app. One thing I would improve on is that you don't have to upgrade to premium to get some of the themes. My favourite are the amethyst, blueberry and sky but I don't want to upgrade to unlock a few colours. Overall this is a really good app.",
"The app is really useful for collaborating on a project with other people, simply by adding their email address. I feel it also motivates you to get things done when you add a completion date to tasks. It's not like a calendar app because it seems more suitable for tasks. Excellent work!",
One of the best to do apps I've tried so far. Lots of support from third party programs too such as IFTTT and Google Chrome extension. Lot's of useful features like inserting comments straight from other apss and creating templates for easy project management. Highly recommended.,
I use the app for my university assignments and it's just perfect. With the widget it's very easy to add new things to the list and I see what has to be done until when. Like that on busy days I just do the most urgent things and when I have some free time I can prepare for the next week.,
It's buggy when it comes to creating parent tasks. The daughter tasks are just doubling themselves. It makes it impossible to operate or check quickly. Also it'd be great to allow to skip some daily tasks and track it in the weekly review. They must automatically move to the next day schedule and not in the overdue group.,
Amazing app. It's simple yet totally customizable and can be as dynamic as you want. I've been using it for one week only and my productivity has increased exponentially. I've tried several other applications but they were always missing something. Todoist is 👍!,
"I think this apps single greatest weakness is the total inability to have a task repeated. Pretty useless in this regard. If I am wrong and have simply missed something, please let me know and I will give it another try. Also not a fan of the user interface.",
"My needs are met by this app - listing to dos, categorizing & prioritizing them and sending me reminders. It's simple enuf for a middle aged person w no interest in learning complicated systems. TY todoist for helping me organize my life.",
"So simple, and just the right amount of reminders.  Makes me feel great, getting things onto Todoist and off my mind, helps me sleep.",
"Does not work on Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, when you try to add a task it just freezes and then says it has crashed.",
"I'm a new customer coming from IQTell, which did more, but is closing its doors. :(  After evaluating around 30 apps, this one came out on top. I'm enjoying using it and its clean easy to use interface.",
"Probably the best to do app there is. I've been using GTasks for more than ten years. Intensively. I love its intuitive simplicity and speed. Now I need more advanced functionality and have tried a lot of different alternatives. Microsoft to do is in development and seems to aim for good stuff, but it's definitely not there yet. Dgt GTD is great. The next iteration, Soda, might be awesome, but with Todoist I found the same simplicity and intuitive interface that I loved with GTasks, a very extensive package of functionality, total flexibility of how to make my own system, and it works across all platforms, with almost identical interface. I'm impressed. I'm still in the process of digging into it's core and moving my big amount of notes into Todoist, but it's already working way better for me than any other I've seen. I'm still on the free version, which I think is plenty for most users permanently. I'll most likely move onto the paid version, since I'm a heavy user and probably can find enough value in the added functionality to make it worth the small amount of money. Spotify costs more than 4 times as much, so not much of a question....",
labels and filters are in the premium tier... cannot decide if it would be good for me or not.  They should really give a 30 days trial to test or something like that.,
"Simple but very effective, reminds you, let's you know what is overdue too.  Free version is more than enough for me.",
The user interface looks very nice and easy to use. The free version however has extremely limited functionality. You can't add and comments or have a description for a task other than the title. You can't set reminders and you can't add any labels. All you can really do is add shells of a task.,
"Helps organize tasks and get them done. Social media aspect is there, but not essential if you don't want to use it.",
Simple and easy to use.. But this is not for me at the moment.. Coz feel like more suitable for ppl who need to do project or task together,
"I bought premium because it's a great product and it keeps me on task!  Constructive criticisms:  I strongly encourage Todoist to offer a proper dark theme and a transparent widget. If you consider the amount of electricity being wasted by white backgrounds on ten million phone screens, Todoist has a pretty nasty ecological footprint!  Some if the functionality is clunky (i.e. inputting bulk tasks can only be done through a csv upload) and the # should denote tags rather than the @ symbol which should denote location or time.",
"Great app! Works well with a gtd mindset. I even purchased the upgrade subscription, which I never do for apps. It was a good price for the year and the extra bells and whistles help me stay organized, but it is definitely not needed to use the app effectively",
It is not relaible in that it doesn't give notifications either by email or the reminder tune it's supposed to make when the time for a set task reaches which is the main purpose of a to-do-list in the first place.,
"Awful, user-hostile interface.  Accidentally mark a few tasks as completed? Too bad, so sad. There's no simple way to ""Undo"" such mistakes.  Company doesn't seem to care at all about fixing issues like this.  UPDATE: company response is ""just go to project and undelete""...So what happens if I accidentally hit ""complete"" instead of reschedule on the Today screen???  Instead of being able to go to completed tasks and ""undo"" the tasks easily, I'd have to visit dozens of projects individually, many of which, from experience, won't show the recently deleted tasks. Ridiculous for a ""productivity"" app.",
My most favourite app and website. Todoist helped me to organise my tasks and did it very effectively. Now I reached the addiction level.,
"Simple user interface Design. Agility, Customization makes it an appealing app. Would have loved more if Notification feature is enable in free edition, at the bare minimum a basic notification. Hope you would consider.",
"Great app, but per-project karma scoring would be awesome for someone like me who tracks work Todo and personal Todo in the same app.",
"All contact and support screens in the app are not working; I tried several times.  We really really NEED A DARK THEME for Todoist; it is painful to use often/extended periods, and I avoid using it because there is too much white. I need to feel drawn to my todo list; instead of Todoist which is what I actually need, I've been using Google Keep checklists because I can color the background (still not as dark as I'd prefer, yet way better than white). I use theming on my desktop Chrome so Todoist is properly dark there, yet on mobile it remains awful and prohibitive and I really need to be using it on mobile. This makes a bigger difference for people than you seem to realize, or you would have developed this a Long time ago.  Thank you for your consideration.",
"Use it for GTD, and it's perfect. Especially the integration with other time management tool, makes it really easy for reviewing. One suggestion is to enter the task config page when quick tap it, or long tap will select it. Currently a single tap is select, that I have to click the edit pencil to open the config page. Seems like a one tap behavior is more intuitive.",
Luke it. Wish there was a repeat task function for tasks to be done every day or week for example. Find the reminder function unusable.,
"This app makes keeping everything you need to do very simple, other apps I have tried cram everything together and make it look extreme. This app also doesn't intensely pressure you to get it all done. All in all a wonderful app.",
A genuinely beautiful and well thought out Todo list app. Over the years I've used many and for me this is by far the best.,
It really helps me get through my day. Usually I'm going a mile a minute so having this app keeps me organized especially with the timer & reminders,
Got the app right after getting an echo device. Excellent integration/syncing across all my Android devices. Very pleased,
"Great intuitive interface, have tried various tools for my to-do lists over the years and this one is the best I've tried so far. Went for premium upgrade too. Highly recommend!",
"Really like this app especially when you add some ifttt stuff to it. Hopefully voice control will be added natively soon. When this happens, the fifth star goes on",
"Hated having to replace Wunderlist due to Microsoft killing the separate app, but quickly came up to speed with Todoist. Android app with web interface works great. Task and project grouping works great. Big push for clearing your tasks for the day. Great app.",
Can you add a feature like any.do where the tasks always remain in the notification panel and can't be cleared that would be awesome thanks,
"The date is all messed up, on Windows app or Android, all my tasks' date will be bumped to the next day, eg 4th Oct will become 5th Oct, Web version is fine. Now it's almost useless to me",
Will be good to have setting up of recurring tasks more user friendly. Would also love to have the option of a dashboard with pie charts showcasing the diferent priorities achieved.,
"Todoist has turned my life around. I can see all my tasks and move them around, but only have to look at today's tasks so I don't get overwhelmed.",
"Simple, powerful. Has replaced my calendar app for most things, and keeps me much more organised. Highly recommended.",
"You can, plan everything by time or also every second day. This is very helpful. The best thing is you are able to connect it to Google calendar",
Helps me keep up to date with what I need to get done. Love the fact this is also available on the web so use it for work and personal tasks I need to  complete.,
This app has done an incredible job of managing my ADHD at work in the short amount of time that I have used it. I've recommended it to many people already!,
"The price is rather steep for such simple (and widely available) functionality, and free version is so limited that it defeats the purpose of using it: eg. you can't set reminders. It's also rather buggy, for instance you can sort tasks in your inbox by priority, but once you add another one, it's not sorted and you have to repeat the sort manually.",
I haven't fully utilized Todoist to it's full potential yet but it has been a big help so far. It kinda sucks to be restricted by a paywall but I'll manage.,
"It's a simpler way to stay organised, the priority tag, project helps to manage the tasks. Mail notification is one of the important feature.",
I enjoy using voice text making to-do lists on my drive to work Monday morning. Once I get to work it's really easy to sort out all the various things battering around my head on a day-to-day basis.,
"looks great and stuff is organised nicely. however, whenever I try to put in a memo for tomorrow, it initially puts the task in the right place, and then after a beat it will move to the day after tomorrow. i don't know why this happens. it is super frustrating and is making me miss deadlines.",
It's a really good app. It help's a lot in realization of my todos. I just hope that they put more tools in a free trial.,
Very good app Need additional features of voice to text. Which will help addition very easy Please please add this feature,
"Good app, runs very well but could have at least completed tasks in last 4 weeks free.",
"Great way to keep things organized. I use it for mostly daily to do tasks but this would also be great for work projects, school, etc.",
"Great app, perfect for keeping organised. Additional functions in paid version are worth the cost, but perfectly functional without paying too!",
Needs an account though my smartphone has a lot of storage and I do not want to share my lists.,
I have been using todoist for the last one year with premium account and it's lot easier to manage the day to day activities. I would suggest the payment mode be changed from yearly to monthly as this will not be heavy on the pockets.,
"Really fast and sleek. I love the powerful home screen widget, and just being as fast as it is makes this app perfect for me so far. Adding tasks is almost effortless :)",
"I get so much more done with this app than I did before. Seriously considering paying for the premium version but/because the free version is already that helpful. I can organize things by priority, project, and have recurring items on specific days and times!! Love it!",
"This app is a life saver - no more multiple lists written on numerous bits of paper, just one place to add to when necessary and the reminder is very helpful - thank you 🙂",
My son introduced me to it. Never too late to learn something new. Use it for so much. Love ability to collaborate.,
I hope it can make more usefully to organize my self. I sad because cost for more feature is too expensive for myself.,
Very simple and easy to use. It makes keeping track of tasks very easy and efficient. Love the way the it records your task with a simple text; orienting it's time and date just from key words in text.,
I liked todoist a lot but I switched to wunderlist because their widget is opaque which looks a lot neater. I'd encourage todoist to add functionality for widget customization,
Fantastic app. The only improvement I can think of is to sync the individual calendars to specific projects (in terms of two-way sync woth google calendar).,
Only just got started but find it very useful and flexible.  Love being able to organise tasks into groups and very helpful to have automatic sync between my computer and my phone.,
Can be improved on modifications option. It's confusing between a tick for deletion and modification is not visible sever times.,
"Its good. I wish there was a notification option that wasnt extra. Also a calendar, but other than that its good for both your computer and phone to sync and edit the tasks you need to complete",
"Love the free version, would actually hope if you could remove the bar which asks us to switch to premium. Otherwise, this app is just too good.",
"I think it's great, but a lot of the things that should be free are paid, like reminders and labels.",
"Good app so far only been using it for a couple of weeks. I'm a Superintendent for a general contractor, it helps everyone get on the same page with multiple jobs going..",
Great app with many many features (pro) to help task managing on projects. The app in very fairly priced for the results it can deliver to the user. I've tried other 9 apps and no other satisfied me.,
"Great, even without premium. Would like to have a general list of tasks with no due date, or to have an option where things due in the future will still show up on your list for the current day.",
Easy to list and organize things you need to do. Very flexible in changing due dates and categories of items.,
Simple easy to use interface and offers a lot of organization. Being able to understand natural language to create reminders is one of the best features.,
"I love Todoist, however I'd love more integration with Google Calendar. I'd love to see maybe a separate feature where my Google calendar events can be at least seen on the Todoist dashboard, even if the event isn't a task.",
Q simple to use and a great way to capture the things I might otherwise forget!! I'd like it to be a bit easier to get a full task list. Haven't used integrations much yet so can't comment on that aspect,
"Keeps me on track. Although not 100% intuitive like Ike, it gives me the seamless flexibility to manage to dos on the PC and phone.",
"Amazingly easy to plan out my tasks at work; in fact, it's difficult to be unorganized with this app. Highly recommended",
"Great app, highly accessible across platforms, which has been essential for me to capture all tasks at any given moment. However, I would really like to see some improvement to identifying the difference between a due date and a planned start date or working date.",
"It's a great way to keep all your tasks organised no matter what platform. Works great on Windows, Mac and phone.",
"like it lots, would like a dark theme and the capacity make it in to a outline journal, but for work and task manager it fits my needs. thanks guys you make my life a bit more organized:)",
This app has made a big change in my life. Has helped me get organized and control the different projects I have going on. I even introduced it to my work and we now use it to keep track of items.,
"It's a great app, I I just wish I could have access to my previous done tasks in the basic app.",
"I love todoist's approach. Very comfortable way of adding tasks, quite few get it right",
"One of my favorite apps. Simple to use and very helpful. Helps me to stay organized without overcomplicating, but it still has many cool features.",
"Great app. Thinking about paying annual subscription, depends how much I heavily rely on the app. A dark theme would be appreciated.",
This app is pretty useful. I will say that I love the incentive of the points you get after completing a task. It adds some excitement for me beside doing the task itself. Im sure the full version of the app is great!,
"Generaly, the app is really good, the only necessary improvement I can see would be to support ""alarm"" for our tasks.",
I don't know what I'd do without this app. For me it is an absolute must have. Thank you for making my life more effective!,
"Good, not sure paid would help me at all Basic features work for keeping track of projects and not missing daily abnormalities",
"Great tool to have close by to assist a busy work-from-home mom prioritize ""to-do"" tasks and track what's been completed and what's still pending.",
"I am using free edition, its practical simple smart interface makes tracking, follow up and update easier than ever! I only miss a bit reminders, still can leave without it! For those who really need it you can find it for a very affordable price in the paid editions + much more.",
"Once I got it set up, it works great. Syncs with my Alexa and google calendar.  My own personal assistant",
"This is the best replacement for wunderlist, I love the fact that there is a firefox addon for it. I just have 2 requests, one please add support for Samsung Gear S3 and second in the settings can you please add a feature to view all projects in the start page like wunderlist.",
Nothing has kept me on track as much as todoist has.  It's cross-platform support ensures my tasks are out of my head and in the app getting planned and completed. Thanks!,
Look no further: this is the definitive multi-platform Get Things Done tool.,
Todoist has helped me a lot. It is a great to do list tracker and has lots is useful features. The app also makes it run well on phones. Nicely done.,
So far it's working great for me. Very easy to use and genuinely helping me organise my life. I'd give 5 stars but I can't seem to set reminders for a future date that will also repeat. I've tried every combination I can think of.,
"A very versatile app, yet simple enough to be easy to use and navigate.  Even the options in the free version are fantastic!",
A great tool to keep track and execute tasks. And they keep adding features! The only reason I rated 4 out of 5 is because there are premium features - thus free accounts don't get the full experience. (Premium features are legitimate in my opinion by the way),
"Best tasking app I have ever used. So quick and easy to add a new task, change the date, track notes and comments, organize by project. As a coach, consultant and project manager I recommend it to many of my clients. All around awesome and simple!",
"Easy to use, annoying enough to get me started but not too much in order to hate the app",
This is very simple. It keeps me organized. I am even motivated to set and keep goals. I  can break down large projects into much smaller daily steps. I really like this app.,
"It's not exactly how I would have made the app, but as I use it more I find it very handy to get stuff out of head and into Todoist",
"Its a Wonderful application. However, I have a suggestion. Please try bringing the projects under the search option. The desktop version does that job, unlike the Android application.",
"I love the interface. The only con is, even the notification reminder option is in premium version. Please, atleast give the notification reminder option in the free version.",
"This is an app that you can tailor to work in a way that works for you, for example being able to put in 'every Tuesday' or setting something to occur every 4 days. All in all Ive used this everyday for the past month and it's very helpful.",
"So far out of all the task management and to-do list apps I've used this is by far the most complete terms of sharing and delegation. Creating and sharing (sub)projects, (sub)tasks, updates on them as well as reminders for each one. All this comes with the premium of course but it's the best deal for your buck. Highly recommended.",
"Disappointed in the lack of functionality and organization in the free version.  Only good if you want a bullet point , no sub-task functionality. Cannot alphabetize, cannot set priorities.",
"Simple UI, and help getting tasks done in a timely manner, are pro's. Limited functions are the only con so far.",
"I think this is the best Todo-App out there! I love it. It's simple to use and is really helpful. Although I wish I could upgrade to premium version but I can't afford that. Still, in my opinion it's a great app. Definitely would recommend",
"Ideal combination of practical, useful and fun... The only thing I would add is DURATION for task planning",
One has to admit it is the best To do app but the only problem is that its too costly if you consider in Indian Rupee. They should consider pricing according to Indian competitors & nothing like it!,
"So easy to use, so helpful and works amazingly to quickly plan your week, even if you don't usually like app planners.",
"Very useful app! It helps me organize everything in lists, you can set reminders and even share your lists with others. I also like that you can have it both on your phone and PC and they sync when you write something in one if them.",
It's very simple to use and it's not annoying and it has everything I need so i love it and find it useful,
"Useful for capturing those random tasks that come to you at odd times, and prioritising workload when you can't see the wood for the trees",
The app is great but the widget is horrible and can't be customized (it would be easy to add the option to change the colors and background),
Awesome functionality at a sustainable price. If I have to tighten my budget during school Todoist will be the last subscription to go.  The option to make checklists within the note section of a task would be a cherry on top of this great app.,
This app continues to keep me on track after three years of use! Every person I have suggested it to has found it to be just as useful as I have.,
Very easy to use. I'm able to add to the list easily as I go and send it to others to keep them on track.,
It's easy and simple to use; and allows me to prioritize my tasks from most important to least.,
"I tried several others before finally finding todoist a few years ago. It's so simple and efficient, and the syncing actually works well (unlike so many others I tried). In my opinion it's the perfect to-do list app.",
"So far so good, I feel like there are a lot of great featured I'm still discovering",
"The automatic time/day tags when you type something such as '11-3' is a bit inconvenient but a good app besides this, I use it all the time.",
I wish it was also reminding me my projects through the day.,
I love that I can link to Alexa and just ask her to add things to my to-do or shopping list.,
Love it. Just wish I could sort by task title/alphabetically within a project or label view.,
Really easy to use wuth non-threatening display and positive reinforcement when you get things done,
"Everything I need in a to-do app. Not the way I wanted, but the way it works. Thanks for the great effort, team!",
I don't mind paying for an app like this but I think its a but much that my wife and I both have to pay to use all the features. Good not great.,
I absolutely love this program! It had been super helpful in organizing my time and work! I have paid for the premium service and it has certainly been worth it! I even got my wife to use it and we were better able organize our life and family together! Great program!,
Excellent app which can be shared across platforms and users. But why not a one-off payment premium app which gives you the extra premium functions?,
I love it! I wush it has visual option so Ican store and look for things without usinf anither app.,
"Amazing for task management. Goes really well with Evernote/Drive for referential material. All I miss is an AMOLED theme, especially for the widget - it would make the homescreen todoist experience even more immersive.",
It really helps me stay organized. Sometimes I get frustrated with the mobile version. I accidentally deleted some tasks and couldn't figure out how to recover them. Overall love it though!,
"I've been using Todoist for years. It's my other brain, where I store tasks, ideas and notes then come up with a plan for getting it all done.",
"Minor tweaks would make this perfect, but it's pretty close! Todoist mashes keeping track of tasks and projects simple, user-friendly and extremely satisfying. This is the fourth to-do app I've tried, and it's by far the best.",
Awesome app.. it improves my efficiency and help me a lot in time management.. Thank you doist👍,
"Really good UX, many features are part of the relatively expensive premium plan, but it also works very well without.",
Its a great app just gets annoying when they send reminders to the email.,
"Love the app and website, but can't afford the annual fee to enable reminders.",
"I like it! And works well with Alexa. That's how I found it, but like that it pops up in my phone to remind me too.",
Used it for years. Last year I thought I could live without it. Wrong. Addicted. Even bought an ebook.,
Awesome app. Best thing for organization and productivity I've found!,
I like the app but the widget does not allow me to cross things off without opening the app itself.,
"The absolute best to-do-list/ reminder app of all time. Seamless integration with web, clean, simple UI, ability to rank tasks, group per project, etc. It literally keeps me in check of my endless items and never fails me.",
Use it every day for over three years. Using the app changed my life.,
Todoist finds the right balance between power and simplicity... At least for my use anyway 😎,
"It helps me to remember all things that I have to do ,It's simply the best",
"UI is good, syncing between desktop/web app/mobile app works well, integration with Google calendar is great! Text interpretation is very useful and makes adding tasks a breeze. I have definitely become more productive after using this app!",
Helps out the most on sharing a grocery list with the Wife. Great to organize what I need to do each day as well.,
I am now literally attached to todoist. Helps me overcome my daily activities as well as big projects.,
Simply awesome and the perfect app I was looking for managing my to-do-list. Simple yet with many features.,
So effective I could cry - I'm the master of my time! Not a slave to my email.,
"It's completely awesome but I would appreciate if we didn't have to pay for anything but other than that, once you get familiar with the layout of the app it's quite awesome!",
"Still new to the app, but love it so far.  Only using the free version at the moment but it exceeds my expectation. Have been looking for an interactive to do list for a while. This seems to be it!!",
"For just a free version, I love it so much and I've recommend it to a lot of my friends. Just 1 wish though, please don't put any ads to the free version. 1 day I will pay the premium version!",
Todoist is really easy to use and good to remind you all the the things that you want to procrastinate,
"I've tried almost every Task app.  This is the one that actually works.  Great tech support, natural language processing, and add via email for premium users make it the best BY FAR!",
"Great app for productivity and keeping track of daily to do items.  I've had problems a few times with calendars syncing with google, but it could possibly be user end error.",
"Very easy UI. Easy to manage and assign daily tasks. Plan for day, week or month",
Good app and I love that it is synced between all of my devices. A bit of a learning curve to get the most from it,
"It remind me of my unfinished tasks and segregating my take based on different calandare work, personal ...etc",
Simpler than calendar apps but is also smart when you put a time on your todo item. Good as heck,
Great app that has truly helped me to  stay on top of all the things that constantly come up in life,
Where was this app all my life...?? This app made me super productive. The only issue I felt is that the widget size is too big. Add some smaller versions of the widget.,
I really like this app. It would be perfect if we could have multiple email accounts logged in,
"The best design, the easiest usability. I use this as my to-do list for everything.",
Wow this is so much better than Wunderlist or any other to-do app I've tried. I LOVE it.,
"Excellent application for task lists, appointments & task-status when managing collaborative reams. The capability to work across various systems is beneficial when providing & receiving reporting with consultants & clients. The ability to utilize off-line is yet another valuable capability.",
Very useful for managing one off and regular tasks. Handy for reminders and usable no nonsense interface,
Favourite productivity app. Very intuitive and easy to get used to.,
Todoist is the best task manager I have used and has made a huge difference in my productivity.,
"Does exactly what it says, and very well. Love the overdue function, too",
Great use friendly to do list app. Would be great to have calendar sync with free version,
"Easy to use and very useful.  Adding tags, due dates, project categories is fast and intuitive.",
Can you guys give options for making the widget customizable? Especially with a dark theme. I am ready to pay for the app if I get a dark/even transparent widget which doesn't hurt ur eyes.,
Simple and clean cut. Easy to use for someone as forgetful as me.,
"Some problem with the sync between laptop and device, but great app.",
"Tried a lot of To-do list apps but none came close to this one. This app is far more beautiful than any other app in the Play Store. And the best of all, it's FREE!!!",
Helps to organize and remember things! 5star as app available on win10 which syncs with Android.,
Simpler and easy. Good 3rd party app integration (Alexa and Google Assistant),
"This app is available everywhere, easy to use and very good overall. Highly recommend it !!",
"Fantastic app, great for organising my to do list by days, projects etc. Love that it sync with everything!",
Best gtd on the market. All the apps work so well and the advanced features really help productivity. Recommend for all!,
"A new, fresh, strong wind for my productivity that put me up to the new level",
Awesome and simple to use! I'm only using the free version but it's great so far!,
"I love the fact that I can add items using natural language, like ""next Monday, remind me to call Mom"", w/o a need to set any date/time related stuff. UX is also great.",
All most most critical features are in pro app. Uninstalled in first try.,
"Suggestions: 1. Please have an autosort option (that sorts everything by date). 2. Instead of just Next 7 days, give us more choices. Like next 14, 21, 30 days, or allow us to make or own filters.",
Really helps keep me organized and focused!! Thanks Thomas Frank for the recommendation!,
App works well and sends an email to you as a follow up to ensure you are keeping on track or you can postpone the task for a later date.,
This app has helped me keep my days on track! Really handy :),
Help me to make to do list every day. Nice!,
Premium version us awesome. Needs Moments like Any.do,
"Its a good app that links with computer, it can sort by date and is very helpful for due assignments",
Perfect to do list. No annoying ads. Love it!,
Great app. Changed how I organize my life.,
Helpful. If only this could display task grouped by categories/tags and calendar view.,
"WONDERFUL APP! I absolutely LOVE IT! EASY to use, keeps me organized ALL DAY LONG!",
"Really simple to use, but make the widget transparent, looks a lot nicer over any wallpaper with any theme!",
"Why on earth you made the reminder for pro version not the free version !! And the plans of primum is expensive due to currency exchange ,, plz consider another way to make us customers for your app  Uninstall untill you consider my opinion",
"Great app, just wish it had a tab where you can view your tasks in a calendar layout. Also, why can't you manually pull tasks in between tasks that have specific times assigned to them? Still a great app tho.",
"Very easy to use, great app. I use it to track both work and personal tasks.",
It is very good for helping me be more productive and not forget important things I have to do,

Epic for admin. Use it and take back control,

Separate premium features from free app. Make it clear when advertising what is premium,
Simple and effective!  I went premium almost immediately and love it.  Who else put rating todoist in as a task??!,
"$29/year to use this my Gear S2? You can't try it first either. I'd pay you for the app, one time, but a subscription for keeping digital lists? Greedy, greedy. Apple has this for free...",

"Хороший, глубоко проработанный планировщик за слишком высокую цену. Пользовался несколькими параллельно, включая этот, и понял, что есть много решений, не менее функциональных, удобных и не таких дорогих.",
"Yesterday onwards the app was asking for password and stop synching. Tried to log off and login, reinstalled and tried without any luck. Hope this will get fix soon from todoist.",
Does the trick,
Does the job,
Works well,
It helps,

"Helps keep me on task and assign as little or as much work as I want to do for my upcoming week. Can send me text reminders. Easy to reschedule tasks, which can be sorted by broad category, specific project, or date. Can make nested lists and recurring tasks. Recommended for all people who need help keeping track of entrepreneurial ventures or chores for home.",
"The app is fantastic, super clean and. I love the widget. The only thing I would add would be a calendar function so you could see future due dates and events and some sort of function to keep track of something you need to do daily, like take a pill everyday. Or else you would have to create a new task every single day and honestly that's kind of a hassle",
"Really wanted to like this app, but not being able to see appointments from my Google calendar is a deal-breaker for me. The point of my use of a to do app is to stop setting unrealistic goals, which often happens when I plan w/o considering the other commitments I have of a day. I also have a few tasks that I do a couple times a week & could not effectively find a way to schedule this.",
"I was sceptical about using a to do list app but this is fantastic. There's a little bit of work to get going (setting up projects etc.) but you can drag and drop projects and subprojects easily to optimise as you go. I went straight in with the premium version to get reminders and notes, which are completely worth it.",
"The coding of this app is amazing.  Its a tool that can be developed for each individual circumstance.  FAQs on website are crazy helpful and am impressed with every aspect.  I miss percent complete... But without it I'm forced to break the task down into steps which I think will work better for me anyways.  Andriod and windows 10 apps were strong for me, having a bit of issue with win 7 but website works just as well.",
"So far so good,  got it to use with Alexa (echo dot), and I love that i could just tell her to add things to my shopping list and it's on my phone when i get to store. ...no need to buy expensive refrigerator to do the same thing.",
It's really helping me to do the things I need. I do feel more productive after start using Todoist. One thing you could improve though is to add a section for habits that don't show up along with the tasks but that are still somewhere so you can see them and that don't disappear after you mark them as done.,
Overall is good. But i found out 1 missing feature (super awesome if have this). It will be great if there is a function that can link between 2 or more tasks from same or different projects so that we know they're inter-related. Sounds cool right!,
"UPDATE: The customer service answered super fast! And was very helpful. Contact them, they listen you :)  ORIGINAL: I like it. Very convenient but it could have more features, since it's a paid app I expect it to cover all my needs. 1. Support for repeting tasks that are X times per week or X times in Y days. 2. Possibility to show all tasks and subtasks indented in Today.",
"Requires account, no thank you!  EDIT: It is good to see that you are sorry, but even better would be for you to make the account optional. It's fine to offer a service, it's definitely not fine to force your users into it. Not to mention the hazzle of having to create five different accounts for five  different apps just so i can try them all. NO!  I want to be in control of my data, and if you can't respect my privacy then I can't respect your ratings.",
"Todoist has changed the way I work. With todoist, my task management has reached another level. With premium features, todoist can be converted into an automated reminding system that will enable regular chasing and follow up with your subordinates and Co workers.",
"I am trying to find a replacement for Wunderlist that MS will discontinue shortly. I can't see how to make a simple shopping list I can share with others unless I buy the premium plan.  If I count the seven devices where I want to share lists this will be a fortune! I can't seem to get support for my most basic questions or find any sort of introductory user manual online. At least the Wunderkinder would respond quickly to questions.  I can to potential for Todoist if only I can get started with the free version.  Update 9/15/17:  I see that only one paid version would be required for me and anyone else who shares lists with me. I have tried to create a simple grocery shopping list and then deleting items as if I bought them.  I will need to see if the feature of Wunderlist that lets people add things while I am actually in the store can work.  Much testing remains so I will hold off on a better rating until I can really complete a full evaluation.  I know this seems unfair but for those in my position, this rating will serve as a caution that your have a lot of work to do in making the switch.  #$%^@ MS!",
"I really like this app. My fiance an I have been using a shared list while planning our wedding and it has been so helpful!  Just a few little things that would be nice to maybe see updated. The widget on the screen won't let me assign a task to a person and I have to actually open the app to do that. Not a big deal just inconvenient.  The other thing that would be nice is if when you assign an order to your list, ie order by priority, that new events added would automatically go into place rather than piling up at the bottom. I always have to keep telling the app to reorganize my list.  But I totally love this app and would recommend it!",
"I've tried so many to do list apps but this one nails it: email integration is its strongest selling point, plus there are so many ways to organise the lists simply and quickly. I'm finding it so easy to keep track of my life now I'm using this app!",
"The best personal organiser so far encountered by me. Fantastic natural language date recognition makes entering tasks an ease. Rely on it daily for work, projects, and university.",
"Really good for students. Helped me not procrastinate and had made me finish more than I intended to accomplish. However, I think it should have more features under the free account. ☺",
"I have seen many to do applications that are far too simple, and some that are complex but with a ridiculous learning curve. This packs all the features I could possibly want, and the advanced features are still easy to use. My search is over.",
"Great, just helpful. Made a huge difference to me as I am normally so forgetful.",
I don't want to create an account to write down a few notes I don't plan to share or sync. It's ridiculous that one is required,
"Karma thing drives me crazy by adding more clutter to my life when  I downloaded the app for the opposite purpose. Looks like I have to buy the app, which I don't mind doing, to turn it off... but I subconsciously hate the app already . Lol.",
"If you are bored or  tired of to do's apps that does not help!!  This is an inteligent enough app who can work with me rescheduling tasks, replicating info in various devices/platforms and a very elaborated costumer support crew. Here you also are going to find discussion forums very helpful. Seriously recommended!!",
The interface is dated and requires way too many clicks (see Keep or Wunderlist). Also it is too expensive when other apps offer similar features at no cost (see prior referenced apps).,
This has come in very handy. It has replaced written list. Helping me keep track of everything i need to get done. I intend on keeping on using it. I like getting the emails of my daily progress. I am keeping the emails for future references. This app is very helpful.,
"Since Microsoft decided to kill my favourite, wunderlist, by making it awful, this has become my go to for gtd. Whether it'll be worth upgrading to premium is not yet clear, but I'm impressed so far.",
"Easy to view but with lots of functionality. Make lists, collaborate, view completed jobs, make tasks reoccurring, easy rescheduling & you can make comments too.",
"Garbage, no good themes unless you pay them a bribe. Stark white widgets are hideous and developers who don't add free dark themes are terrible human beings who hate people with migraine issues.",
"The free version is kind of a joke, and does not allow to test much. Why don't you just make it a pay app.",
"This would be great, but I find it really lame that the ability to add simple notes to a project is only available with the $3/ month subscription. Any decent project management app should have notes enabled for projects.",
Everyone knows that imaginary Internet points help people work harder. Also IFTT + ToDoist = a brilliant way to organise your life,
"I have been using the app for about a week and find it very easy use and helpful. Additionally, I have integrated the app with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT, and both work well.",
"It's a simple yet comprehensive design. It manages my to-do list, motivates me to complete them, but is not cluttered and overwhelming.",
"It has really helped me organize tasks. It is very user friendly. I am using the free version, but the full version would be even more powerful for increasing productivity and reducing mental and other clutter.",
I have had the most success with todoist for getting my daily work tasks done. My only issue is that when a task has subtasks the sub tasks deadline dates have no effect on the parent task.,
"I was searching for a to-do app and was recommended todoist and what can I say besides that it is amazing and does everything I had wished for. The design is clean and intuitive, the synchronisation between multiple devices works flawlessly and I am certainly more productive than I used to be!",
"Have been using this for 3 years now. Fantastic app. Good thing is it has all clients - web, app, desktop app etc. and this is my main motive behind using this app. Would like to have some out of the box feature though.",
"I love this app! I've been using it for a while now and it's making all the difference in how I organize my time and my projects. I've tried lots of different apps but they're too complicated or they just don't suit me, but this one is perfect and has really made a difference.",
This app has helped me  balance my home life with my work. I feel like I am getting more accomplished and therefore not as stressed.,
"The app needs to be much more sophisticated. Often, I want complete the tasks in next week rather that on a particular day ...",
Ive only used it for a few days but I can say that this is such an amazing app 💕 Probably the best to do list app out there,
"I absolutely love Todoist. I've even got us using it at work for high level task management. It takes my mental load and dumps it into the ether, meaning I don't have to juggle everything at once in my head.",
"Simple but powerful. Tasks can be added quickly. Smooth, speedy syncing. I do not feel enslaved to this app, as I have to other task managers. Premium features well worth paying for. Book and YouTube videos by Carl Pullein helpful when I was getting started.",
This is the only daily task app that I've stuck around it. Absolutely love the work that's gone into it. Recently reached a milestone & I was pleasantly surprised with a free 3 month premium code to use. Great job!,
Yh it does remind you of things you neex to do. U are forced to keep postponing until u get sick of postponing and actually do the thing. Hooray great app😑,
The live integration with Google Calendar is quite useful to me. Better than all the other apps I have come across,
"Great to be able to have all my lists in one place and to be able to see upcoming ones. Also I love that I can create daily, weekly, monrhly,",
"Great app, have been using it for years. Recently the app suddenly would not connect to the Web backend - customer service responded quickly and a simple log off and back on again solved the problem.",
"Hi, your app is not giving notifications on my device. Need Help to fix this pls..  Update: There is an app called Any.Do which seems to be working on my device. Thanks and Sorry for the trouble. :)",
"This app is nice enough as the free version. I like that it reassigns duties to other days if you miss them. I also like this list for things that don't need an alert reminder partly for time flexibility, mainly because the alerts are part of the pro version.",
I have checked out several of these apps. I used each of them in real time. Todoist is by far the best. It is scalable to your specific needs. The integration with Gmail was the easiest. Awesome app.,
It's AMAZING. Everything I want in a task management app. Be sure to watch some tutorial videos on YouTube to get the most out of it.,
I've tried plenty of apps. This one is great whether you use GTD or your own system. This is what I've been looking for. I love the location based reminders.,
It's a great application because to give an easy-to-use interface allows to create an environment where the user can improve your performance.,
Brilliant app for managing your tasks whether it is personal or work. I use it everyday and I will definitely premium once my trial is over!,
Very handy app for keeping track of things to do. Nice that you can also access and edit your list on a laptop via their website.,
Helping me quit procrastination and organize myself better. It may help develop habbits or get rid of addictions.,
Awesome to do list app. I particularly like the different projects and am becoming addicted to karma. This is making me more organized and more relaxed.,
"By and large a nice, simple task tracking application.   My only issues are that the date entry functionality can be pretty obtuse for some things, and some features I'd consider core to this type of application are only in the premium version.",
Great app! Easy to use and really does help with organisation and time management.  Support team are awesome. Super quick with easy to follow advice.,
"I initially switched to this app so that I could access my todos via an API. However, it is so much more than just an API. It is a really great and intuative app that encourages you to get stuff done.",
"Takes some time to set up and get used to, but it has really helped me turn my life around.",
A to-do list that actually keeps you productive. Keep your tasks really small to keep chomping through them.,
"Literally can't get work done anymore without Todoist, all my workflow is centered around this amazing app.",
Uts giid as a tool.  It was easy for me to adapt it to my workflow. I also use it to jot down shirt versions of in the moment ideas fir later action.,
"Excellent job on this app. After IQTELL went down, I needed apps to take care of everything I do. This and an email server are doing the job very nicely. Thanks Todoist.",
Pretty good. Not as editable and flexible as Workflowy. Love the calendar component. Wish it was easier to copy and move selected tasks,
This app is great. The only things that are missing.. are the ability to tag contacts as when I need to remind myself to call someone. On screen notifications for reminders would be great. Other than that.. it's just perfect.,
"I've been using this app for about a year now. I've shared it with many of my co-workers and they have all enjoyed it as much as I have. It's easy to keep multiple lists and has plenty of options for setting reminders, keeping notes and more. This app really helps keep me organized.",
"Excellent app, simple to use and has really helped me organise my life and become more productive.....I am a general practitioner and use this app daily which has helped me provide better patient care.",
"I've tried a lot of task managing apps but Todoist is by far my favourite. It's easy to get a hang of and has a beautiful layout. The free version has more than enough features but if I had the money I'd definitely go for the premium. Great job, Doist 👌",
"For an app which is for organising lists and to make to-do lists. I cant understand why notifications would be a premium feature. Any native alender allows you to create reminders and tasks with notifications, so why cant this feature be free.",
"This app has helped me alot so far. There are some gripes I have with it, like not being able to change notification settings per-project, but all in all it's crazy usefup. Part of my day to day.",
Integration with browser and calendar and ease of use makes this one of the most useful apps in my app portfolio. Google calendar meshes with app in both directions saving time and minimizing confusion.,
Vengo de wunderlist y todoist cumple con todo. Edito para indicar que puedo elegir qué emails cambiar. La verdad es que es muy recomendable esta app.  Thanks for your help!,
"Interface is well designed and runs smoothly both on mobile and web applications, but with loses traction with price and lack of features with the said premium. Would love to see more group collaboration and even interconnected system with other productivity apps.",
Pretty good app but I wish you could do categories and reminders/notifications without buying the full app.,
"Todoist premium has terrific cross-platform syncing along with web & Google Calendar.  Use it on all your devices. Also, on MS's Arrow Launcher (another of the best) install multi-view Todoist widgets on the homescreen 'utility' page. This is a killer combo for keeping on top of your projects & todos.",
"GTD enthusiasts will not be disappointed.  This is a great app that works across all relevant platforms (iOS, Android, web browser, Windows app) that I work across.  Easy to use and intuitive.  I was using Google keep but needed a bit more structure.",
"Simply the best. I've used many different task management tools and keep coming back to ToDoist for its feature set, ease of use, and cross platform performance. Accept no substitutes.",
"I love this app. My husband and I use it for our home tasks, shopping list, wishlists, etc. I use it for my own personal to do list and reminders as well as for work. I've been looking for a helpful app for quite some time now and are so happy I found Todoist. I love the beautiful simplistic design, it is also very user friendly. I recommend the app to all I meet. I love it!",
"I love how easy it is to create/edit tasks. The projects feature is great, I love the way it's easy to re-order tasks, change the date & get a qyick glace at each project individually.",
It's a good app that works well. The upgrade is also relatively cheap if you want full features.,
"I've searched for going on 5 years for a to do list app that genuinely worked for me. Todoist is everything I wanted and more. Im now more focused, forgetting less and getting more done. Keep up the good work guys!",
"Brilliant app! Clean, minimal and highly functional, would recommend it to anyone seeking to structure their lives and enhance personal/professional productivity!",
If you are tired of being nickel and dimed for every app then forget this one. The first thing I tried(change the color) told me I had to upgrade to premium. No. $28 my foot.,
Best app I have ever come across. That's all I can say really. Bought pro version straight away as so convinced with the basics. Try it you'll see!,
"Amazing app, great user interface quick,  no ads, exactly what I needed to keep myself on top of things",
Horrible. I shouldn't have to read a GD book to figure out how to make a list.,
"The layout takes a bit to get used to, but it's really useful overall.",
Love it! Great for putting GTD in action. I switched over from Doit.im after noticing that Todoist provides more frequent updates.,
Love it! Recommending it to friends. Only wish I could edit more than two lines at a time and scroll down faster. Still great!,
"I actually feel psychologically lighter with this app, knowing that I have a place where all the tasks I'm responsible for are listed.",
"Probably the best to-do app out there. I've tried them all, and todoist is the best at keeping this quick and simple, with enough functionality to help manage actions amongst my team at work",
I love this app! So far it's the best to do app I've tried. I can't believe how much easier it is to track all the moving pieces of multiple projects.,
I really enjoy this app.  It has helped me keep track of my busy life and to stay motivated.,
I really love this app. I like that it's connected to Alexa as well as my email. I can access my to do list no matter where I am!,
"Todoist sets me FREE!!! I create a task and then forget about it. It reminds me when the task needs doing. I put tasks on my children's chore list, they love it.",
Love this app. Wish the premium version wasn't a premium price as I'd love the upgrade!,
This has been immensely helpful to me in organizing my life. It's absolutely worth trying.,
"Neat, links to my Amazon Alexa everyday. Helps keep a college student organized while busy.",
"I never pay for extras on anything, but I love todoist so much I paid for it as much out of appreciation as for the extras. This app helps hold my crazy life together! Thanks!",
Great and is good to get you into a habit. Makes me feel proud because no tasks overdue.,
I'm much more organised now and I haven't forgotten a single thing!,
A lot of great features to be more productive. The premium version is not cheap but it's worth it.,
It's the best task managing tool so far I've tried!feeling more productive now! The best thing for me is the task date suggestion feature!,
"Very flexible and easy to use, whether you want it simplistic or hyper-complicated with projects and due dates, it works either way!",
This app enables me to group all my tasks together. It also can do recurring tasks and you can group tasks into projects.,
I wish reminders were free but I love the simple interface and having a calendar to-do list in my phone,
I love it..its easy to use and very usefull..but pro version is to much expensive,
"Excellent app! Good for collaboration, super easy to use, intuitive, good for recurring tasks",
I used to use a computer task manager app but lately it wasn't syncing well across my devices. Really glad I made the switch! Love the Karma scoring!,
only had it a few days but so far it's been great for helping me to organise my life 👍,
Great app! Responsive team even replied me in reviews. Hopefully they have Markdown for task short note soon.,
Using this with GTD (getting things done) is a god send.,
Amazing app!! It really boost your productivity. It's very helpful for me to complete daily task. Thank you 🙂,
Very easy to use and useful for keeping track of (and prioritising) the myriad of daily tasks that easily overwhelm me.,
"I love getting notification reminders, makes this free app very underpriced!",
One of the best Todo apps around. Great for organising and scheduling tasks as compared to a Google keep which is more for notes and lists.,
Easy and powerful app to sort through your personal and work to-do lists (and more),
"Being a person that works on multiple projects, this app has helped my take control of my life. Thank you Todolist !",
Free version good. Might want to upgrade for some of extras. Trying it for a bit longer first. Getting nice and organised.,
"Great Todo app, way better than the built-in Google reminders, which never work properly.",
"Syncs with web version, interactions differ a bit across platforms but learning is good for the brain....",
Awesome app. Respectful price for pro version. This app is very handy and manage your time too. Give it a try 👍,
"Has a bug: sometimes when adding a new item that is due the same day, it doesn't show up on the inbox",
Meet all the needs as a to-do list app. Keep reminding and pushing u to complete the task.,
Loved it! I used to use google docs for my ideas but this is perfect and organized!,
"Wow! This is by far the best task management app on Android. After using this for a day, I've uninstalled Google Keep! The UI is brilliant and intuitive. Best feature of the app has to be Projects. Great job guys!",
It's a list app that can't contain lists in tasks! Uninstalled after first shopping trip. Plenty of other (complete) options.,
"Oh my god how much do I love this product.....massive that's how much, massive. Even the upgrade which is worth a big thumbs up is ridiculously cheap, like ridiculous, love it. Big fan.",
"Just right, but perhaps can do with narrower entries to squeeze in more lines of to-do items",
"App is good for organising many projects at once.  Can be used on multiple devices, also in Firefox.",
"Difficult for me to organize inbox. I can't find a way to categorize tasks from the inbox, eg allocate them to projects. Am I missing something?",
It's handy to have a app like this to keep things organise.,
"It's the best to do all available online. You can send it across all platforms, it's free and you can store unlimited tasks. What else could you all for? Thanks developers for the app.",
What a rip off at 32 euro per year.. a useless app unless you upgrade.. no thanks at this price you can shove it.. app deleted..,
"Fantastic useful app, it would be nice if the pro version is cheaper and there was multiple themes for the widget outside of that the app is super helpful and make keeping track of things so much easier",
"There's a bit of a learning curve, but it's super helpful once you figure it out!",
Unable to Un-Complete a task unless your premium. MUST be premium to View completed tasks. UNINSTALL!!!!,
Please add ability to set start and end time for tasks. Combine this with ability to view projects and tasks schedules and reminders on calendar.,
"Todoist is an amazingly clean and effective way to organize tasks. Personally, I've used it all throughout High School, and it's been indispensable in regard to keeping track of homework or important dates. Plus, it has the karma system, which I find is an entertaining way to keep track of your productivity!  After using Todoist for as long as I have, and after having such a good overall experience with it, I could help but almost feel obligated to leave a review to show my support for the app.",
Great app so far does all I need and keeps me ontop of things,
I thibk this app help me ti remember ne all job or task that i need to settle.,
Really helpful. Unfortunate that you have to pay for some basic features,
Absolutely great for busy schedules and syncs seamlessly. Also has a design that makes me drool. Great job Doist!,
I'd tell you but I'm busy ticking things off in life😉 Great app!,
I love when tools are easy to handle. todoist makes it very easy. Thank you!,
To Do done well. Makes me Do what I want To Do. To Do the To Do gets the Doer Doing. This Todoist To Do list is the thing that you have To Do.  Want To Do?  Get this it makes you get stuff done. Efficient and also if you do not get up to this game or they need dealing with at a later date that is easy. Worth it for productivity.,
Absolutely the BEST tasks management system in existence. Period! (and I would know; I've tried all of them lol) The free version is surprisingly feature rich and does everything a casual user needs. The paid version has a few extra features for intense business users - well worth the price for a system that will help you bring order to your whole life. For me it paid for itself in less than a week (it was like I got 51 weeks free! lol),
Buena aplicación recomendada! Es sincronizable en todas sus versiones Windows Mac android,
"I used to love todoist, now it lost all the features that made this app great.",
"The paid version does everything I need in a clean, simple to use interface.",
Great application! Wish it was free and had more family options.,
Great app! Keeps me well organised and I love all of the options it gives you! Best 'to do' app that I have tried!,
I like this app alot. I really like the reschedule feature.,
"Amazing app, helped me a lot to get my things in order. Two thumbs-up!",
"The ability to have my life ""projects"" listed in a very accessible widget on my home screen is amazing!",
Unless you buy the paid version this has fewer features than Google Tasks and that is free.,
Helps to decrease a little chaos in my life. Grateful for that,
"Awesome app, great for students. However is a bit limited in terms of features for the basic version",
Nice app now I'm not missing anything which I have to do.,
Helped me organize my life so well when I started graduate school! Perfect for personal productivity!,
The graphic is a bit confusing and not user friendly,
"Minimal, yet feature-rich and the multi device sync is awesome!",
Overall a great app. Would be great if it contained a notebook facility as well..,
This app has helped me immensely at work and home. It is extremely user friendly.,
I was looking for an app where I could see my whole weekly calendar I finally found it!,
Freemium app that I'm seriously considering paying for the premium features. Easy to use.,

"Excellent little app, does what it says on the tin and interfaces perfectly.",
Now that I have figured out how to get all my calendars to speak to each other I love it!,
"functional. really helpful. to do listing should be this way, simple and straight to the point",
Best app for keeping track of things I need not to worry about,
It's very useful in keeping things in order. It's very helpful.,
Very simple and straight forward. It just works very well.,

Great  way to manage tasks across multiple devices. Just love it,
Wonderful app. Non disturbing but still reminding you for your activities.,
Excellent app. Beautifully clear interface and very pleasing to use. Best task and list app I've come across!!,

Still learning finer points but so far it's been a great help.,
Great app. Easy to make tasks. Also the date recognition is super useful and convenient,
Great GTD / ToDo app with flexible features allowing it to scale depending on needs.,
Best app... I have used so many app for this purpose but this is the best one.,
It's a very useful application if you want to control your deals.,
I'm a better person because of Todoist. Thanks Doist team!,
Todoist is a great product! But please add widget transparency option!,
Exactly what I needed. So simple and great with no Wi-Fi.,
Love this app! Very handy and can have a shared to do list with other people. Worth a try,
"free version is great, though I do wish it includes calendar integration",
Really easy to use and very helpful especially for organising daily tasks.,
Very useful and friendly app. Lots of integrations could be made with other apps or platforms.,
It is good to manage your everyday tasks. Helpful and easy to use.,

"Great App. After trying lots of other similar apps, this is my favourite",
Easy to use features I need working with several clients and moderately complex projects,
Helps me stay organized and complete tasks in a timely manner making me more efficient.,
Use it few times.. Follow the example then you can fully utilised the apps,
I am using for one year as premium and it made my daily life easy.,
It's great but it doesn't have notifications which is not very useful,
Nice app and really like using it with the Amazon Alexa shopping list feature.,
It meets all my to-do needs.,
This is a dope app keeps my life going everyday,

Get it. Now.,
essy to use,
A+,
money sucker,
Reminders are premium,
Use it EVERYDAY,
Required account,
The subscription price is a bit on the steep side (todoist is pretty useless in non premium form) but it is well worth it for the productivity gains I have experienced. I used to be an anydo user and todoist is simply far more powerful. I also love how well they have adopted the material design language and truly made their apps look native on each platform they're on.,
"Quite simple to use once you have the hang of it, however it is a little unintuitive at first. The premium features are nice but not necessary and don't get annoying if you are a free user. If you are using a simpler Todo manager, it is worth switching to this one if you are willing to spend half an hour or so to figure out your optimum setup. After using it for longer it becomes an amazing and necessary part of your life.",
"Love watching my tasks topple over as I smash through them. The colour coding is great too, you add your general tasks to a main list which is one colour, then anything that matters or important in bright colours, so it tells you if your spending too much of your days on the day-to-day rather than the big stuff that will make you happy!",
"One of the cleaner task managers I've tried, both on desktop and mobile. I'd be so excited to have support for multiple accounts for work and personal (we use Google Apps for business at my company).   Android wear support is still light. I should be able to view tasks by project or at least inbox by default and not ""send to wearable"" which is clunky.",
"I've used a number of tasks systems, from Taskwarrior on the Termux CLI, to Gtasks and Tick Tick, to Wunderlist on the web, etc. While Todoist seems to lack some of the great integrations of the aforementioned apps, the IFTTT integration makes up for it. The entire package is intuitive and beautiful. One complaint, the text parser doesn't seem to handle multi-day tasks...",
"I loved this app! not sure what all the features are but it's a great app for reminding me what tasks I have to do and letting me check them off, please though PLEEAAAAASE, if you see this devs; can you add like a sound that plays when you check or a different one for when you finish all tasks? not sure if there is as I usually keep my sound off but that would be cool. One more thing, can you make it so when you complete your daily tasks the message instead reads like, Done or congratulations! you've completed your daily tasks! then maybe something like now you can sit back, relax, and order pizza, that'd be funny",
I can't figure out how to make repeatable tasks.  I'm sure it's there I'm just missing it. The knowledge base wasn't any help either.  Edit: the developers were very quick to respond to my review and the issue I was having and they solved it. I now give this app a solid 5 stars. Well worth it especially with the quick responses!!,
"2015: Natural language task due dates, attractive design, priorities, and other features are all great. Unfortunately, you can't delegate tasks on the fly but must add someone to an entire project. Despite my issue with delegation, I live and die by this all though mostly on desktop. Good stuff.  2017: Though I still wish I could delegate on the fly, this app continues to be the most important tool to organize my personal and professional life. I can't say that there have been any game changing features. The true two way calendar sync is nice though there wasn't an iftt recipe to do something similar. I have not invested in todoist business as it doesn't have features that I'd like to see on a true business class app - analytics to understand worker productivity and easily manage overdue tasks (ie. Notices to managers when a team member has an overdue task). I use premium and that works fine for me and most of my team with an exception or two is on the free version.",
"Best To-Do list app by far. I have tried almost all of them and this one takes the cake. It has a clean, simple, and minimalistic UI with lots of available customization and hidden features. The free version is a bit limited but the Premium offering is well worth it for the price. The way of writing a to-do, in a text message format, is brilliant and very well thought out. However, it does take a bit of getting used to. Once you do, though, the shortcuts available and smart date suggestions are incredibly useful. The ubiquity of platforms, great features, and amazing UI/UX make this app amazing!",
"Just tried the basic version, works well but with some limitations in terms of flexibility in managing tasks, given that it's free I can't complain. Very nice integration across devices too.",
"Very simple to do app. There are thousands, I have tried a few and this one is great. It is done on a metodology GTD (Get Things Done). Easy to collaborate with others.",
"Fantastic tool. Minimal interface, but well design and powerful. I'll be using this for a long time",
"Except for the design, the functionality is super amazing. I use it for team work and cross syching. Exceptionally simple to use but tremendously powerful for team work",
This app is the only one that keeps me on task. It is convenient and easy to use. The reminders aren't annoying and the display gives you everything you need at a glance. Great app.,
seems ok. It's a bit annoying that premium features aren't visually differentiated in any way. It'd be nice to be able to reschedule tasks a little more selectively rather than automatically.,
Great app. The watch functionality is not intuitive or very useful. 5 stars as soon as it is updated,
Astoundingly good. I love the smart features. I just set a task at priority 1 to repeat every day starting this Monday without leaving the text input bar. Brilliant!,
I've tried all the Top ToDo apps and this is hands down the best. It's flexible and allows the user to really Setup the workflow that works best for them. Has some great features and capabilities when you actually take a few minutes to learn the ins and outs. Probably the best aspect is it's ability to handle both low and high volume projects and tasks with ease.,
Awesome app. Simple to use. I wish you could add some tasks completed at different times in case you forget to strike them from your to do list you won't lose your streak,
Great app. That keeps you on daily tasks. Have a little trouble checking off overdue tasks,
"This app has saved my life. I'm a journalist, and this allows me to manage daily and weekly duties and ongoing projects separately, and it allows for recurring tasks. Never going back to post-it notes!",
"Sub tasks should be just that...sub tasks. Not just indented on the list. They show up in filters with no indication that they are subs and no indication who their parent is. Also, better history.",
"Really like it, premium would probably be great but it's a bit too costly.",
"Quite simple but functional, Google Calendar integration really put it over the top for me.",
Seems good but way too expensive for the paid version. £21 per year!,
"I've tried out many to-do apps, and this one is my new favorite. Clean and simple, but with more advanced options like priority and projects for those who need them",
"My life wouldn't function without this app. It seriously changed my life. Taco Bell, if you're reading this, I love you too.",
"Because IQTELL shut down I had to find another application. It does not integrate as well with e-mail, but is better for daily lists of tasks.",
"Love the application, but I can't seem to type in dates or times and have the to do item automatically tagged for that particular time anymore :S I have to manually go into calender and select a day. Help!",
I did not like this app did not do what I needed and was hard to ues with hard to understand,
"Edit: Two years later, I am as reliant on this app as ever. If it's not on my todoist, it might not get done. Love all the functionality. I HAPPILY pay for a subscription. I learned how to use every feature, was worth the learning investment.",
"Amazing app. Honestly, it saved my life a million times.",
"I love the interface, I have multiple lists on my home screen and serves as an excellent reminder to get tasks done!",
"Could be easier to make sub-tasks, but overall a very strong organizational app",
So far this is the best Android Todo list manager that I have tried so far.,
"Everything what one needs: 2- ways and multi device/ platform sync, projects, tasks. Simply smart enough.",
"Does the job well, without getting in the way. Great for scheduling jobs.",
I've tried any number of task management software and Todoist is hands down the best!,
Good app. Very easy to use and having it on my notifications list is good as well.,
Does what I needed plus has possiblity of additional features by going premium.,
"I don't appreciate needing to sign up for an account when I don't even know if I'd like the app, then being told I'd have to pay almost $30 just to be able to add labels?! No thank you.",
"Great app ...if you truly use this diligently, this app will automatically organise your day / week for you ..👌👍",
Great free app works with Alexa great for shopping lists,
"Good way to keep up with tasks, allows for an efficient use of your day.",
Used todoist for years; app is solid and easy to use.,
"Excellent user interface, love it!",
"Love it. Simple, intuitive and interactive",
Best task management system out there by a mile.,
"Superb app, keeps me in order",
very good app for managing your everyday tasks.,
Trying to organise my works in time bound manner.,
Easy to use.  Helps me not procrastinate.,
Great! Well organised for my daily life!,
Simple to do list app with reminders and emails,
Awesome way to organise things to do,

Easy to use and worth the premium fee,
Simply the best productivity tool...,
Miss default project thing,

Straightforward to-do,
Great tool.,

"ලේසියි, පහසුයි.",
"Amazing todo list app. Been using it for over couple of years. Really like the user interface. It is very nice, smooth and easy to use. Love the natural language for creating tasks. And full support for recurring tasks is nice. Not really into folders because you can only see one at a time which is why I really like using labels. Too bad labels and reminders are only available in Premium version. And it does not make sense to me to pay $28 per year just for the couple of features I want to use.",
"I was a long time use of another GTD app but don't regret switching to Todoist. I Love the browser and email integration, project sharing, and am oddly inspired by Karma points. Natural language scheduling isn't flawless - I wish there were more manual overrides - but this is by far the best task manager I've ever tried (and I've tried a lot of them).",
"Would be perfect with Barcode scanner for building shopping lists.   I just ordered Amazon Alexa wand, just because it can scan UPCs and add to cart or list.  But this would be better as I get older, I find that I'm  forgetting, but this app with location awareness and notification. I can pick items on my list and save a trip. I know that tons of product UPCs databases are accessible through the net, and the option scan a Barcode to shopping list, and Google VR and transcription is good but far from perfect. I will say that the app has a little bit of a learning curve and is not as intuitive as I would've hoped, but the app I used before  changed the old UI and forced an update, but it integrated well with Google core products.   UPC code reader and list builder would be awesome.",
"Its lit. I think some people are being a bit too stingy about the price. You get all the basic features for free. If you want a ton of additional features (some of which, you probably won't use) THEN you pay.  I'm super disorganized and this app has helped me get my life together, would recommend",
"About two years ago i was looking for a good to do list app to keep track of my stuff. Checked out todoist and it was pretty lame so I adopted Trello. Two years later, i read that todoist would be fully integrated with Google calendar. So i checked it out. Boy has it come a long way! Great app for staying organized.",
"Todoist has completely changed the way I operate at work. I used to think i was as efficient as possible. However, what I didn't realize is how much I was trying to get done in one day. Todoist has forced me to be realistic about and aware of what I have to do and in turn get more done. It's also WAY WAY more user friendly and efficient than any other app and I have tried them all! Thank you Todoist, you saved my life!",
"It was a good app, but sadly the function to write in renewed things partially stopped working, so at random reoccurring things disappear and I don't appreciate having to add them again. Changing app now, because that is one of the most essential functions to me.  Addition: Disabling Google Calender integration does not do anything to solve the issue (as it was already disabled), nor does enabling and disabling it. This exact issue was why I also stopped using the app on different platforms, but it was still working on my Android devices until recently so I was still using it until the Android application started having the same issue.",
"I LIVE, BREATHE & LOVE Todoist. Bought a year subscription after about 20 days of using it. I was an Outlook tasks user for YEARS, it was the ONLY way to manage my workload, until I found Todoist & never looked back. I've been using it for over 6 months now, I believe. 😊 Todoist is an awesome, almost flawless, near PERFECT task manager. If using Outlook, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend that you download the Outlook add-in. I use the add-in daily & if I'm on the go I use the app on my phone (shortcut to add a task is AWESOME btw!). However, I hardly touch the Windows 10 app. I would love to use the Windows 10 app more, however it lacks the ability to attach emails to tasks easily. Todoist wouldn't work for me without the Outlook add-in, it's definitely an essential must-have feature.  Todoist, please incorporate some sort of implementation of Outlook &/or Office 365 into the Windows 10 app. Also, please fix the issue with subtasks (I don't understand why the parent task shows as a separate item randomly, even when I * to make it ""not a task"", but a title). I'd like the parent task to show, then I need to expand to see subtasks, not have subtasks listed randomly everywhere. I hope that makes sense. I guess maybe like a checklist function? I'd also like the ability to set my own default filter to filter out a certain project or label from my running to-do list.  Other than those few requests, I have NO issues with Todoist. It helps me be efficient & on top of my workload daily.  Thank you Todoist!",
"One of the first apps I've found that not only has increased my productivity but also allows me to use GTD without having to force it. There is a learning curve, but the design is such that it's still easy to use for the most basic of functions.",
"Application is really good but there is a huge bug that appears often. After update it appeared again. All the notifications appear since the original app instalation! After update today this happened again. I installed this app in February and all the notifications from February started to pop up, ring and vibrate. If you guys fix this, app will be awesome.",
"I feel like I have tried them all.  This is ""the one"".   Simple enough to make it intuitive, powerful enough to make it useful.  Clean design for crystal clarity.   Powerful integrations.  The quick add function helps capture inputs quickly and easily.  The Outlook integration works flawlessly and enhances my productivity.  Perfectly seamless across all my devices.....web browser, in Outlook, on Android phone, and on iPad tablet.  I honestly don't know what I would change.  For me, it is exactly what I have been looking for.",
"Used a Todoist probably a year ago and liked it, but at the time didn't need it. I just decided to start using it again as tasks at work pile up. Seems that a massive number of features that used to come free are now ""premium"". I'm generally fine with this and may ultimately purchase it for some of the cooler features. HOWEVER - I find it ludicrous that viewing completed tasks from the Inbox is a premium feature. I expected the free version of this to-do list app to be (at minimum) as functional as a physical list that has been jotted down on a piece of paper. Hiding competed tasks from the default Inbox behind a paywall makes pen and paper (or at least another app) seem like an attractive alternative.",
"The best organizer I've found so far. Worth going premium. Tried at least half a dozen and this is the one that fit my thinking/organizing style best. Good balance of form and function. The interface is not the most intuitive, but it's simple enough and gets the job done.",
"Edit: it's 7/7/2017 and with the latest update the app is now back to its original state and I'm ecstatic about it. Adding items is once again fluid and a joy to complete  Original: As of 7/3/2017 this great app was made annoying by now forcing you to select a ""project"" every time you just want to add an item. Crazy thing is this is a recent unnecessary change; adding items used to be as easy as typing it in and pressing the arrow. Extra hurdles add up the more you use",
Good for simple reminders. Would prefer different notification options. Eg a pop-up with vibration and/or tone on my phone at a specific time,
"After going back and forth between Todoist and TickTick for the past year (TickTick being my main ToDo app for several years), I have finally settled on Todoist. Quite simply, Todoist is the better app. It just does more. In fact, the more I really get into it the more it seems to do. This and I do prefer Todoist's UI. I like the way it looks and it just seems to flow better. It does (for the most part) everything that I need it to do...and then some. I like the ability to create projects and sub-projects within sub-projects. While TickTick does offer a Project feature (called Folders), as well as sub-projects (called Lists), they do not allow sub-projects within sub-projects.  With Todoist I can choose a different color for each individual project. This is not currently an option with TickTick. I also like the ability to create subtasks. However, I am missing the ability to create checklists within a single task, which is a TickTick feature that I used regularly. I especially like (with TickTick) that I could (within a single task) add different times for individual items on checklist. After every item was checked, the task was set to repeat, along with the checklist. I'm not sure why Todoist doesn't offer this feature but I am hoping they will add it. Still, Todoist is packed with a multitude of features, some of which I am still discovering. To get the most out out of Todoist, I do recommend visiting their website, as well as watching YouTube tutorials by seasoned Todoist users. My new favorite thing is the ability to create filters. I also like the ability to create uncompletable tasks. Not to mention, I am making serious use of the label feature. Needless to say, I'm all in. I officially love Todoist!",
"I've tried them all.  Only Todoist incorporates so many great systems right out of the box, such as the Eisenhower quarters (priorities) and Getting Things Done (main Inbox bucket, projects).  The simple language to add tasks, even with complex recurring reminders,  is the best I've seen. Shortcuts and completions really speed up adding tasks as well!  Todoist is the best app for organizing, prioritizing, and getting through the ever-growing task list of my adult life.  I've been lost without it.",
"I usually don't rate apps, but this one definitely deserves a review! It's very simple and efficient and it's my top choice for a reminder app. I love it because it's compatible across multiple device: my phone, tablet, and PC.",
"Very good app. Works on all devices and operating systems. Integrates well with Newton Email and Google Calendar.   Only request is to keep the formatting when adding emails to the comment section, including hyperlinks.",
"Fantastic app for organizing a busy life! I use Todoist to implement the GTD method, plus I keep a bunch of other lists like shopping lists for specific stores, gift idea lists, books and movies that friends recommend, and so much more. The features in the free version are a great place to start if this is your first time using an app like this to organize your life, but I came over from many years as a Wunderlist user, and within the first hour of using Todoist I knew that the Premium level was going to change my life!  Premium has so many amazing features and it's completely worth the totally reasonable annual fee. I was not looking forward to changing task management apps, but Todoist made it so easy and I am so much happier with Todoist than I ever was with Wunderlist! Thank you Todoist Team! You've rocked my world!",
"- ES: estupenda aplicación de productividad centrada en la gestión de tareas y proyectos. Lo que es MUY CUTRE es que las tareas que uno va completando... ¡desaparecen! Y lo peor es que para verlas, ¡hay que pasarse a la versión Premium de pago! La ve",
"Helps me keep organised. So many features like quick add, scheduling, the ability to share tasks with others and sync with your calendar",
"It had limited functionality but now I have to scroll a long way to find today's stuff, very annoying.",
I have used this app for two years now. I have to admit it has come a long way. Wonderful development team and amazing support. Possibly best to do app in the market.,
This app helps me get alot of things done and to remember to do them. Much recommended.,
"Great app, has proved very useful in  keeping track of a project I'm working on with a colleague. Wish it was easier knowing how to add subtasks, took a while to figure it out bizarrely.",
"After trying dozens of to do list apps, this is the only one I've ever stuck with. I've used it for a month. Just the right amount of reminders/notifications.   Love how easy it is to add items and give a date and frequency.",
"As a student to have tasks and calendar combined is essential. If you're looking for a task manager and share lists only, download it, you will love it!  🆘🆘🆘 Edit: Am sorry, my bad. Calendar is just a premium version addition, it's not missing as I thought was. Found out when I was curious of premium reading ads. So that could be more clear, hehe. Perhaps on the left side and if click show a pic of what it looks like to use both so I know what am buying? I also noticed there seems not to be any try for free, or payment plans of less than a year? I'd add that too.  overall it's a great app guys!!!! 😊",
"No problems so far. I was surprised with bow easy I could set up tasks with unusual repetitions, like first Tuesday of every month. Wish the free version had some better notification settings.",
"I used to use that other program that is going away, and even used to take meeting notes with it. I don't see a way to do that with this yet, but as a to-do list, this one is much better.",
Amazing app. I have a paid plan. Just love the application. It's seemless and really integtates well in a complex work like I do. Highly recommended.,
Much easier to use (for me) than Anydo. Sync to my other devices fast an reliable Slightly irritated by email reminders but can switch off Am sure I will develop other facilities as needed,
"Not willing to pay to get reminders, when there are many other free apps that I can get reminders sent. I am just using it for 1 person without need for elaborate tagging. I just need darned reminders. Looking elsewhere.",
"Multi platform, integrates with numerous other systems (including email and IFTTT). Use it everyday for personal and professional task management.",
"Minimalistic interface based on Google's material design standards with powerful functionality. Great personal task manager, a home run for teams.",
Love it. Todoist is by far my favorite to-do list and reminders app. Powerful. Intuitive. Effective. Todoist boosts my productivity and helps me stay on track and organized. Would recommend.,
Easy to use and very productive. Karma keeps me in check and boosts my ego to do more. Thanks.,
"Best Todo app of all the many I've tried. Fast, flexible, reliable, available on all platforms and constantly been updated. Makes creating a system that works for me easy and fun  rather then trying to shoehorn me into a system that doesn't suit my way of thinking. Thank you Todoist",
"The creator of this app sends you emails.  I never signed up for emails.  I just wanted a to do app, not spam.",
"This has been a game changer in my productivity. Of course, it's only as good as the effort you're willing to put in.",
"Great app. Well worth the premium membership if you're using it across all parts of your life, and if you're not, you're probably going to be happy with the free version.",
This app has been a life saver. The only reason why I don't give it a 5 is because of a few places where logic doesn't seem to be present. But it's really good anyways.,
Been struggling as an aspiring writer. Managed to force maybe 1000 words over the past year. Then I downloaded this app. Thanks to the discipline it promotes and the satisfaction of that green checkmark when you tick off a task as complete I've pumped out 3700 words in about 6 days. It's fantastic.,
The best app for keeping up with the things you need to do. Love it  I can't say enough good  things about this app.,
"Todoist has increased my productivity and I can't live without it! I would like to purchase the paid version, but $28.99 a year is just too much. I'd be willing to pay a one-time fee of $28.99.  EDIT: after using and loving this app for about a year, it has recently started to annoy me by deleting my tasks, particularly recurring tasks. I have no idea if it has deleted any of my non recurring tasks because I don't see them every day, but it scares me to think that it has. I saw a response to someone else from the developer that this problem is related to Google calendar integration, but I don't have this app synced with my Google calendar.",
More than I can ask for in it's free tier. It has been super crucial in getting me in the right productive path.,
No reminders in free version. And pro version is very costly. They should lower their prices according to PPP. Todo list without reminders is useless. I can use any notepad app instead of free version of todoist.,
"The web client is incredible, but the app falls behind. More bugs than I expected (tasks not updating, lists breaking, etc) and an unintuitive/slow interface at times.",
"Used and loved for years now. Feature rich, and has always worked well for me although there are some quirks you have to learn. Gamification works!",
"I love this app.  Its easy to organize my thoughts, create sub categories, color code etc.  Allows you to organize thoughts without being confined to a preset structure.",
"Love todoist.  Works on all my devices, syncs reliably and allows me to feel a sense of accomplishment every day. Liked it so much got a pro subscription.",
It's help me alot to organizing my work and make me focus to finish things much faster,
Just what I need. The repeat weekly function is good for recurring tasks. I may purchase the upgrade version.,
Nice app! Keeps my mind clear and my thoughts organized! Thank you! From a mom with many things to remember. Not complicated. Easy to learn and use.,
"Very reliable and accurate, with a wonderful intuitive design. Works great. The full version is not free, but it certainly worth the money.",
The user interface is nothing like the videos that I downloaded from Youtube? What appears on my Android cell phone is simple and I can't seems to figure out how to edit the todos or much of anything else.  Also since Sunrise calander is defunct is SolCalendar intergrateble with Todoist or what calendar app is for android?,
Great app for managing your plans. It is very simple and at the same time has all the functionality you can possibly need.,
It's one of the best to do lists I have ever used. Its interface is very clean and making a todo Is super quick and easy.,
Love how this synchronises across devices and notifies me of what I need to get done. Great for repetitive things that are easy to procrastinate on!,
A plain and simple TODO. Easy to use. Simplicity is it's specialty. It does not bug the user unnecessarily and let the user mind the business.   Loved it.,
Easy to use; very intuitive. Does not slow down my phone like calendars do. I like that it captures all aspects of life in one place.,
"Easy to use, crisp and clean interface, can be as personalized as you would like, and keeps you organized while not being overwhelming or overbearing with notifications and reminders. 5 stars, and interested in trying the premium free trial.",
"It is very helpful, though I wish reminders are not paid features since it is the feature I need the most but I can't afford to buy premium. But overall the free app is great!",
"This is by far the best to-do app I've used. I mainly use it for recurring chores, and it's crazy customizable when it comes to planning HOW you want your recurrences to happen",
"Couldn't live without it. Since I started with todoist over 2 years ago, I can't count all the things I have accomplished thanks to this app. Simple, efficient, it just works.",
"It works for me.. For work as a systems engineer in an IoT leading provider 
/ company.. As well as my personal needs too!",
"Best task management app I've used. Leveraged it according to the system in Tim Challies' book, Do More Better. Also using it for managing my team's deliverables.",
"I don't understand how Spotify, a company with over 100x the net worth, struggles with basic incremental improvements while these devs are so on top of every platform and essential feature.",
Pretty good. It's date system can get a little tricky though,
"Really good app to help you track everything you need to do. I really like the projects features, it gives a really simple to organize everything. Good work!",
"Terrible trolling app, I add things to the list and they disappear, or move on their own to a different list! I keep adding things, even changing the time and date and it keeps saying I'm done for the day and to enjoy my afternoon!",
This app has been super helpful to me. My work requires that I travel to and from many hospitals and healthcare facilities. I can track all of my pending items in a really neat and concise way thanks to this application. I highly recommend it.,
It has really helped me to be more organized and not let things I should be doing fall through the cracks.,
"Happy user, just what I needed to keep me going , the twists on the classic to do list are great.",
"Great app. I wanted something to replace Wunderlist as it's on its last knockings. Very pleased, reminders should be a free option though!",
"This app keeps me on top of everything I need to run my legal practice.  It is easy to use, it's sleek, and it integrates well with many other apps like IFTT. Keep up the good work.",
Its so easy to enter items and use the interface. Beautifully designed and its become so useful in my life i actually paid for premuim. Take advantage of the help page on their website. It explains how to use all the tools very well.,
"It really helps me get myself in order and see everything that I'm trying to do, and that helps me with my time management",
"Gets better with every update! Really like the new duplicate function, saves a lot of time. Very powerful and flexible tool. Tip: use in conjunction with an app like Texpand to set up task attributes in just a few key presses.",
"I'm a premium user for 3 consecutive years and the app it's great, thanks to that I can task my activities for the work, university and other responsibilities.. But please make a complete dark theme, with this everything will be completely great...",
Love this app! Switched from wunderlist after Microsoft announced they were going to kill it. Haven't looked back.,
"I've used several task management apps, this one stands out so much that I upgraded to premium.",
"Ap is huge, no offline version...there are better apps out there offline with open source syncing​.. after reply from dev I thought I would give it go as trial...  it did stop me once I read the permissions.. this app is asking too much.",
"Very useful and easy to use. So far, so good and it has what other tools don't",
Very intuitive commands and very quick to use. I tried all the other ones before settling down to this one.,
"Great clean and simple app. The basic version is a little frustratingly limited, which loses it 1 star",
"Friendly, easy to use and really helps managing the things I need to get done.",
"First to-do list app I actually use. I've tried dozens before and none have been so easy to use. In only two weeks, I feel like I am a lot more productive! Great app!!",
"So pleased to have finally discovered todoist. The huge plus for me is that I can use it for work and home. I've downloaded on my work laptop, my tablet and phone so I'm connected wherever I am.  3 days in and I'm loving it!",
"A solid list app. A lot of features are stuck behind a premium paided service, but even without paying extra, enough features are usable and it still makes it a reliable to-do list manager.",
"I'm a total convert to Todoist, I think the system works amazingly well and I love the app shortcuts and natural language input. Just wish the interface felt more like the iPhone; more in line with the web, desktop and iPad experiences.",
"I love how I can empty my brain space of minutia, and organize my tasks by date and priority. It makes setting daily goals a breeze!",
"There is a app for every platform, everything is cloud based and gamified, best to-do platform around.",
I really like this app. It helps me keep track of 'to dos' and increases my motivation and production.,
To use the reminder feature you have to get premium... I'm no programmer but I'm sure it didn't take an expert to design an alarm clock or notification to pop up...,
"Very good, but it's a pity about the in-app purchases. The basic function (which is free) is very helpful.",
"Has absolutely everything you need to manage your tasks, even if you organize them in creative ways...",
"Great design, motivational ( without bombarding you with reminders ), organized, and intelligent. ( Understands human speech patterns )",
I need to figure out how to adjust settings. I can't add tasks directly to Todoist without having a message pop up telling me to upgrade.,
"I just love the way it is made, simple yet attractive layout. Very easy to use.",
perfectly  crafted! missing feature: Next 30 days view,
I love this app.  My time management in my pocket.  With the ability to manage several projects,
One of the few apps I use every day.  Glad to go premium and support the team behind a great app,
"Syncing is troubling me a bit, but overall, the whole thing is amazing.",
Very user friendly with helpful reminders and it's great that it syncs between devices regardless of the operating system.,
Couldn't imagine organising my life without it. Almost 3 years as a premium user :-),
"This app is really good, I recommend it.  Esta aplicación esta excelente, la recomiendo.",
"It's kept me on task for weeks now, and I couldn't be happier.",
This app has improved my productivity and organization tenfold.  One of my most used apps for sure.,
Easy to use.. sometimes the date interpreter messes up numbers,
Simple and easy to use the web and desktop interface are very nice and the Android one is simple and clean.,
Love it! Helps me to get things done.,
Smashing!   Way better than the osx app.  Todoist let's my type-A side really come out :),
the best to do list app i've used so far!,
Just a few days but loving the syncing between tablet and desktop. Simple to use.😀,
"Does what it needs to do. Evernote and OneNote are fine, but have developed feature bloat.",

Was hard to learn. Not intuitively laid out.,
The most user friendly to do list type of app I have ever used.,

Very simple list manager with date reminders - just what i was looking for.,
"Really good, worth the premium value. Integrates well across android, web and windows.",
"My only complaint, it changes words like ""friends"" into ""fri"" ""ends"". So when I try to say ""saturday hang out with friends"" it'll change the day from saturday to friday.",
It's been a great help and the reminder emails are awesome for setting the day off nicely,
J'utilise Todoist depuis déjà 5 ans et je suis nettement plus efficace,
Great App for keeping track of works loads. The suggested reschedule feature is really helpful.,
Enable option to periodic remainding of works.. Like monthly weekly daily etc,
An awesome intuitive app that allows me to prioritise each day on all my platforms. Love it!,
Easy to use. Really helps to keep track of what you need to do.,
Extremely useful time management app that also make it very enjoyable to organize eveyrthing.,
Useful app helping me to get things done in time,
Excellent job creating a clean interface and reminders that actually help me remember I'm forgetting something!,
They've really worked more and more toward a very enjoyable interface.,
It's everything I was looking for in a to-do app and fits exactly how I like to work,
Super easy and great user experience tried many todo apps.. But finally will stick with this one!!!,
Love the app but a little high priced for the premium features,
Love the ability to do quick tasks and integration with other apps. Need Google Inbox integration,
It keeps me accountable and I love the prompts and satisfaction of clearing a list,
"Just started to use it, am addicted",
I like how easy it is to use it and the ability of it to recognize time and tag when typing,
I will be better if you offer free alarms options,
Helps tracking our day today activities in a much better way,
Still working through how to get the most out of this app but so far so good.,
Easy to set up and use. Works with Echo!,
"It is exactly what I wanted, an easy way to make lists and set reminders.",

"Beautiful Todo list app that you have to pay a monthly subscription for basic Todo list functions that other apps give you for free.  They have some nice looking subtask functions, but they're buggy and hard to control.  This is the second time I've tried this app and found it lacking. I'd pay $5 for an app that works well, but I'll never pay $25 a year for an app that barely goes beyond the basic options of many free apps.  Looks are nothing compared to functionality and value.",
"A truly awesome app, it's extremely helpful. The only ideas I can think of would be​: An option to change the name of Karma and an option if you have completed a task, but forgot to cross it off the list, it wouldn't count against you. Other than that I'm really impressed with the app.",
The best to do app Ive ever used. My suggestion would be to add an option to use the app in a calendar format. So you can make to do and put it from 9 to 11. Lets say. And that youd be able to select the hours for the calendar (cause night hours are usually irrelevant.,
The price to go premium just doesn't make sense. It is ridiculously high. Never valued my pen and paper so much. Or even Google Keep,
"A really great App! The interface is clear and simple to use, only subtasks sometimes can be annoying, especially when you add a separate due date to them. Other than that the app is almost perfect.  I'd like to see an integration with third party calendar apps (e.g.) Outlook and maybe another way to share files or access them, because if you have more than one file to share the comment section can get quite confusing.  I can only recommend the app, especially for the fair price of 28€ per year!",
"This is my favorite app of the ones out there, but PLEASE create an option to ""add child"" when you're editing a task. The handling of subtasks is really awkward and clunky right now.",
"Many good features, however, many of these features are only on the premium version.  Premium version is expensive for one year ($28).",
"Todoist allows me to keep my to-do list on me at all times, which I love. Plus, I can share tasks with my partner.   Room for improvement: subprojects don't show up with the tasks when clicking on the main project, making it more annoying to navigate.",
If you don't want to miss out on any task then this application is a must for  handphone.  The tasks can be synced using the desktop url as well. Awesome app.,
Version 12.1 freezes on my Galaxy s5. Overall great app only limit 200 projects and inability to make offline backup seems a bit unreasonable for a premium account paying customer. Please fix.,
It really helped me write out all the tasks that needed to be done. The capability to schedule (one-time or reoccurring) makes it useful. It is easy to work with both in Mobile and desktop.,
Surprising that such a simple app can have such a profound impact on how I get things done. It's quick and easy to add tasks and I'm finding that what's on my daily list gets done. I'm more than a convert - I'm an evangelist!,
"Too many of the desire functionalities are only under the paid version. The possibilities to configure the widget are really low, specially compare with some of the free agenda/calendar apps out there, you can configure the size of the widget, colors what to show etc. Too many functionalities are paid such as basic reminders. You will better off downloading an agenda application, nicer more configurable and not as much paid things.",
"Keeps me interested in my schedule. With other list type apps I have tried, I tend to just fill them up and never do anything.",
"Don't know what happened in the recent versions but the app won't show any tasks if you are offline.  If I add a task, then go to inbox then the tasks shows.",
"It is simple, yet highly adaptable. The busier I get, the more features I find to help organize. Thank you Todoist staff!",
Best to do app I've found so far.  Really appreciate having both repeating tasks and subtasks in the same app.,
"I love this app. I would like to set a due date, day and hour on the free plan. I think these features could be together.",
"Simple and useful but it doesn't have the option to see the completed tasks, they simply dissapear when you check it.",
Keeps me on task and focused. Helps when you are depressed and need reminding of self care as well.,
"Great motivator! It is hard to show your worth at work when the office does not provide a means to show performance but Todoist is my hero, motivator and collaborator. I do nothing without first adding in Todoist.",
This is most powerful when used with the outlook plugin. Been using it a week and my boss even noticed I've been more on top of my $#!+.,
I'm sure its a great app for some but personally I just didn't like the design of the app.,
This app is very useful in helping me stay organized and it's easy to navigate through completing projects.,
Easy to use and syncs across devices. Minimalist design helps keep things from feeling overwhelming.,
I like the app a lot I just wish it were easier to voice activate while I was driving so I could put in my lists while on the road.  The reminders are great though.  I really can track what I've done for my monthly reports,
"Easy and intuitive.  I think it is odd to have reminders past the paywall, but I really enjoy this app.",
I love using todoist to keep me on track. It's even better now that it syncs with Google Calendar.,
"A little confusing at first, but perfect once you understand everything.",
One important enhancement is just by swiping the task to right the task gets completed and reverting it becomes a big head ache after a few seconds. Can you make enhancement to ask for confirmation before marking task as completed? Its very important when we work in large teams,
I have got nothing to say about the app. Simply a better app I have used till now. Keep it up!,
"Now with the added support for two way Google Cal sync, I am sold.",
I tried this a year ago but with their changes and YouTube helping me understand the app I really love it now,
Turn your OCD up to 11 and get stuff did!!,
Love the app but the price for the premium version is quite expensive to me.,
"I first installed this app to help me in school, but it turned out to be a great app that I use everyday!",
"Excellent, simple, works on all platforms, no ads, dependable. One of my favorite apps that I use daily!",
"Great app but even better when you read ""how to be a productivity Ninja"" by Graham Allcott.",
"I am still learning how to use it, but I really like using it and learning more.",
"As I learn all the app can do, I love it more & more!",
The app doesn't work offline,
Makes it easy to write down tasks and has helped with productivity dramatically,
Still new to this. Lets see how it goes,
It was pretty good before but now with Google Calendar integration its fantastic,
"The best planning app I ever tried, really improved my productivity",
Great simple app. Can set tasks easily.,
Pretty comprehensive for a to-do list.,
What kind of to-do app has no reminder feature in free version ? Wanted badly but uninstalling Ufffff...,
Most useful app. I love that I can pair GTD method with the app.,
"Well designed, stable, easy to use, perfect as far as I am concerned.",
Helps to keep me on track.  Love it!,
Keeps me well organized and never forget,
easy and useful. i can efficiently complete my tasks now,
Best app for getting this done with very little effort,
Most productive app I have used to date.,
Really intuitive method of adding tasks with natural language,
Keeps My Study Goals In Check✓,
Easy to use and keeps me on track. Great features,
Interface is good it is very useful apps.,
The best app to organize my tasks!,
It is amazing! Easy to use and really helpful!,
Thanx for making this great app..,

Recently switched from Wunderlist and loving this app.,
Excellent now it is integrated to Google’s calendar,
Absolutely excellent interface and always a pleasure to use!,
So far so good. Keep it up!,
Awesome. Much more efficient now.,
Very easy to use. Love that it is cross platform.,
"Easy to use, clean, and intuitive interface.",
Great list app. Very easy to use,
Very well put together and easy to use.,
"Very easy to use, multiplatform and really fast",
Very helpful and well thought out,
Invaluable in keeping up with tasks on the go,
Helps a good intention become an action,
Wonderful app that helps maximize and manage time.,
I like the to-do list app,
No ability to add notes/details for a task without the paid version? No thanks.,
I can't even set reminder for free,
"Fun to use, once you get the hang of it",
Great interface - clear and easy to use - Cheers!!,
Was hoping it would synch with Outlook to do items.it does not.,
Great app for keeping organized!,
Just what i need to keep me moving based on priorities and deadline .,
More than I expected... Great design with great features ....,
Just my favorite app ever! :'),
Please add Material Dark mode and Windows Dark mode on Win10 too.,
"Simple, well designed",
Easy to use.. love it!,
"Attekintheto, de egyben robusztus, konnyen es gyorsan kezelheto feladat menedzsment szoftver  egyeneknek vagy akar csoportoknak",
Stops working offline,
"It helps having a digital list to do, and seeing the progress I make each day. Thank you!",
Perfect!,
Decent application very helpful,
I love it.,
Geat program.,
Nice and complete?!,
Free and great UI,
Easy to use and intuitive,

Good and professional,
Pretty useful,
Easy and great,
Good one,
Working fine,
Good,
Excellent,
"Hasta ahora todo bien, solo sería bueno que tenga la opción de un calendario para poder visualizar las tareas en ese formato.",
Labels is paid feature,
"This app is indispensable. I use it to manage both my work and personal tasks. I have tried several task management apps over the years, and have stuck with Todoist. It's easy to use and I can access it across all of my devices (Mac and Android0.",
"It requires you to build a system to really be great, but it gives you lots of tools​ to do so. Also, plenty of rope to hang yourself with though. It took me two tries to really get it right. Top notch app at the end of the day though.",
"Extremely useful and intuitive app, I only wish I could add location reminders from the main screen like I can with times and dates.",
"I really like it, lots of capabilities. Takes a bit to learn it but once you figure it out.  Very eay",
"Great App. The olny reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that reminders are falling under premium features. This really should be available for all users. Other features are ok to be premium, but reminders, it would be great if you could correct this.",
"Super easy UI, the Widget is very nice and does pretty much everything from your home screen :) 5 stars app for sure...",
"Great integration with the Android OS notifications and Google calendar. Easy to add and complete projects and tasks. Great Material UI, very nice!",
"An organization app MUST have reminders for your tasks. But since these are a premium feature, the free version is utterly useless, the app equivalent of a paper weight.",
"Not really useful, would like it to prompt with a notifcation and send and alarm etc or something of the sort. Uninstalled this.",
"Please add the ability to have lists auto sort when a task is done when the sorting criteria changes (date, priority, etc...)",
"The app concept is great and as long as it works - it works fine. That's why I give 2 stars, not 1.  Yet, when some issues emerge - many time You're lost. Sadly, don't expect big support from the support team:  1. Sometimes the order of tasks gets ruined for no reason - I reported it in Sep 2016 (ticket 72002), waited for the answer, bumped the ticket 3 times in May 2017 and got an answer: ""So sorry for the delayed reply! We currently have a backlog of emails and this is affecting our response time. I apologize for the extremely delayed reply."" (anyone has an idea what it means?) + ""we'll get back to you with an update as soon as possible""  2. Multiple times I had to manually re-adjust dates of my task which has been ""automagically"" changed by Todoist - sadly, no real help from their support, had to do it on my own  3. Once they converted some of my recurring task into non-recurring, so after marking them done, they disappeared - again, the support admitted there was a bug and… suggested I find ""disappeared"" tasks on my own  4. Multiple times I ran into trouble when travelling between time zones.  If You're lucky and experience no issues - great. Otherwise - You're lost!",
Amazing App! Perfect for anyone who has a lot of things to do but doesn't know where to start,
It helps me remember things. I use it with the getting things done technique,
Love this app. I really like that it integrates well with the Amazon echo. It has a clean UX and is easy to manage.,
You get points for doing things. It's great!,
The best app for personal productivity issues I found so far... I absolutely love it!!!,
"Clean, easy interface.  Works with Alexa.  Helps plan and coordinate projects around the house.  Definitely recommend​ it.",
Haven't used it yet but looks good on the outside and that's what counts right ! WRONG it's the inside peeps the INSIDE THAT COUNTS,
"I become a lot more productive when using this. Also, the fact that it's on your phone is great!",
"Uninstalled! Everything needs to pay, gtask is still better..",
Lots of things you can do with it.great item.,
In combination with Alexa this has helped me get increasingly better organized.,
Very useful for keeping on top of things.,
Helping me more productive in my personal goals ...,
Simply the best Todo list app out there.,
"Great features, nothing unnecessary,  perfect",
It is a great program and is helpful for your schedule.,
$44 per year to be allowed to set reminders!? isn't that the whole purpose of a to do list??,
Never leave me ToDoist. Never leave.,
Need labels and reminders so I need for my app please thanks also o need some reminder can u update this app please,
great to do apps,
Useful,
"This has the workings of being a great app, but unfortunately I can only speculate since many of the options were unavailable on the free version. The fact that reminders are considered a premium account benefit is ridiculous. Although I liked what I was able to try, personally I cannot justify paying the subscription fee when other apps offer just as much for less. I was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, but this is definitely not it.",
"Just enough power. I've tried many apps and systems, but had always sought too much complexity, shunning services like Todoist as too simple.  Ironically, as I've gotten busier the complex tools became too complex to keep up with. Todist doesn't follow GTD precisely, but it offers just enough power to make it work, with great usability. After a few weeks with it I feel like I'm back on track for the first time in years.",
"One of the best apps around.  I find really useful the possibility of nesting everything,  from tasks to projects, apparently without limits. The only small things I regret are the lack of the possibility of setting a duration/start date for a task nor its stayus, the absence of a percentage/status bar of completion for parent tasks, and the fact that the ""today"" view doesn't show the high-priority unscheduled tasks.",
"Until recently, Todoist was hands-down the best app I'd ever found for android, and the only app for which I've ever been willing to pay annual fees to use the premium version. The new design is all about style over substance and makes it more difficult to manage tasks, so I'm looking for an alternative.",
Like the connectivity across devices but still lacking with androidwear. Clicking on the app via my LG watch does nothing. So if Im at a store and want to  look at my grocery list I have to open the app first on my phone then go to settings to view the list on the androidwear device all while handling a shopping cart. Please update so that list /to do's auto sync with androidwear app to be pulled up directly from there .,
"At first I was skeptical about many features and most praises. But from the time I started using it, specially since I started subscribing to the premium account, I fell in love. And more and more I get impressed.  To new and even old users, i suggest Carl Pullein's video series called ""working with todoist"". He shows the power of todoist that it hides behind the curtains of simplicity, while it actually has features that other apps can only dream of.  It has an awesome support, great development, insane stability, magnificent tutorials and unbelievable user experience.",
I've been using Todoist since early 2013. The Android app was the main reason I switched from an iPhone 3yrs ago - the quick add and snoozing work really well on Android. I have since tried a dozen other apps but have always returned back to Todoist. It just keeps getting better and better.,
"It's a glorified check list, but it's doing what it takes to get me on track for my busy day. Believe it or not, there's a little bit of a reward in the reward center in my brain every time I check off a task. And, it's actually gotten me through some very busy weeks. The most valuable aspect is that I don't have to use brain power to try and keep track of everything I need to do in a day. I can concentrate on one thing at a time, and when I've finished that I just check my Todoist to see what's next.",
"Needs one thing - I think you should have the option to be able to see the tasks within a project that youve already completed. Either with a strikethrough, or maybe a checkbox.   Hate to say this because I like the app, but if I find a to-do list app that has that, ill be switching to it. Thank you!!",
"The app I've been looking for since i got my first smartphone. Easy to use and keep on the front page of the phone. I use it as half of the front pafe and have been super organised ever since. Hoping to perfect it soon with some trial and error, and looking at some of the help ideas. Really good and I've got lots of friends and colleagues on to it. Thanks",
"I'm not one to place reviews unless they are warranted.  For years I've been looking for ways to mange my productivity and have now found it.  This app not only helps me manage my work tasks, but also my families tasks at home. We share projects, organize tasks, and even assign chores for the kids. We have shopping lists, temples for seasonal projects, and personal lists for our own productivity.  I could go on and on how this has helped, but you need to try for yourself to see.",
"Overall solid app. Great features, even the free ones. Intelligent parsing is perfect - ""do X every other day"" works exactly as expected. I do understand having a free/pro model but I'd prefer they make a separate free app without all the pro buttons. I constantly tap them by accident when learning the layout and its frustrating to dismiss pop ups every few seconds.",
"Todoist has a lot of features and is great for advanced users, but still easy enough to use for those just getting started with to do lists. Its main flaw is the lack of UI for repeating tasks. It is not obvious how to set a task to repeat and requires you learn the language the application is expecting. Even then, it is not clear if the app has understood your entry correctly and this can lead to errors or missed tasks. Overall I think Todoist is the best to do list service for all and well worth paying for premium if you are an advanced user.",
"Great program, been using it until recently upgraded my phone to Alcatel Shine Lite. Now the program crashes every time after I type in the password and it tries to login. No longer usable, hoping this would be fixed soon. And yes I've upgraded and been communicating with support, whom always said to wait for next version, Currently still not working!! Its been more than 8 month!",
"I have used serveral task manager apps, but because I am a chronic procrastinator, I got fed up of pretty much all of them. Todoist is different - it is simple, elegant and a great productivity booster when you break down your projects into small tasks. Also, props for incorporating instructions on using different productivity systems in your knowledge base. Great widget too!👍",
This is an amazing app but you only get notifications if you pay for the full service. The paying subs works great for people and teams in business but as an individual I need none of the paying features apart from notifications. The app becomes pretty useless without this critical feature that we've come to need in any Todo app.,
"Tasks everywhere. Numerous platforms. UI fairly consistent across them all. Some quirks, but all in all a great app and service. Update 3/13/15: I have taken one star away due to lack of sorting ability. I have become dependent on this app, and have loaded a ton of tasks in it. I noticed this feature omission months ago, as have many others. I took another star away because no matter how many times sorting is brought up on their ""support"" site, the only response ever given is ""we will consider this for future updates"".  The issue was first brought up there over a year ago.",
"Easy to use. Attractive user interface. I would love to see productivity charts in the next version, so that you have a procrastination score and a chart. There are some tasks that I've been procrastinating for like a week now. Or maybe you can modify the already existing chart so that it counts each overdue and postponed task. Thank you.",
"Plenty of filtering and sorting options, but not many color categories to choose from and not very new-user friendly. Personally, I prefer Any.do's group-style layout and notification system. Todoist just feels like ""Gmail lite"" ...like I'm sending myself an email, labeling it, and dropping it into a folder with a reminder. Also, the PC version seems buggy and doesn't want to save dates at times.",
"It's really useful, has notifications and is linked to your email so if you have a lot of stuff to do in one day the overdue items are emailed to you. It's also great for sharing things with other people e.g. Places to go and movies to watch. Be sure to explore the different options and utilise the undo button!   It's better to label the icons first time or have a help, its a bit clumsy if you are first time user.",
"Bugs!   Telling me things are due in incorrect days (a day off). I checked time zones, actual due date set, and all matches up and isn't working.   Too hard to edit due dates besides words (nice for easy to set date, though). Will be trying other options for now.",
"By far, this is my favorite To Do app for projects, managing tasks, etc. My wife and I both have Premium Accounts and we put groceries, and other task lists together so we can be more productive. My wife still likes another one better, but she's weird. As a side note, the Windows app version doesn't always sync very well (I had to log out and in a couple of times to force it), but the Gmail, Web, Android (and even MS Outlook Plugins) work amazing! But this rating is for Android, so it suffices to say that I love it on Android! It really is one my most often used, and hands down one of my favorite apps.",
"A one-stop shop for all the things I need to remember in a given day. I like the organization of it, the friendly reminders of what's on my task list and being able to access this list from multiple devices. I also really love their blog with all the organizational tips.",
"It's a good app and would love to pay for it. $30 usd a year is nothing at all for Americans.... But for other countries, you can't just directly convert that to local currency.   In India its 1800 rupees per year which is pretty expensive for an app. My yearly Norton antivirus subscription is the same price!   You guys need to factor in the per capita income and cost of living Index of international countries when fixing prices for them. Direct currency conversion will not work.   This is a necessity if you guys truly envision yourselves becoming a big player globally.... Even in third world countries like India.    Atleast add the reminders functionality in the free version.",
"Good for a basic todo list including recurring tasks, but doesn't feel like a finished product. On Android, Gmail links open in the browser, not the app, which is a big minus for my usage. (And the Gmail integration does not work when you have multiple accounts on any platform.) Combined with lack of ability to track time and a much reduced functionality in the free version, and this app has me wishing I was back using Microsoft Outlook. And I hate Outlook....",
"Everything is perfect, wish you could make sub categories.  You can put tasks under other tasks but you have to share them all and sometimes they don't all show up. But very great for personal use, some minor changes would make it great for group use",
"Best todo app I've found and I've tried many.  Love the calendar sync option, exactly what I was looking for.  After 22,000 completed tasks it still amazes me....  I get puzzled at the 1 and 2 star reviews of folks complaining about not having features that it actually does have, read instructions people.... Keep up the good work!!",
"Smooth, user friendly, powerful. I especially love the hierarchy options, recurring tasks and possibilities for sharing. Sorting projects is a nightmare on a tablet though (drag and drop I mean). Other than that the only remark is that I wish Toggl and Todoist would just be synchronised. Now you need to manually add the projects in Toggl and they don't offer the same detailing. But all in all, the best app (and free!) to keep me from having a 1000 post it's hanging around. Might check out premium for the calendar integration. And I wonder if I can keep all completed tasks visible till the completion of a project, for the satisfaction of seeing 'to do' get shorter and 'done' get longer.",
"Not As Pretty or Common Sense As Wunderlist, But Gets Job Done.  Switched from Wunderlist for the ifttt integration with todoist. Not as pretty or user friendly. I make a permanent grocery list but it goes under a ""projects"" drop down? It's not a project, and it's permanent. Why can't it go right after inbox? But it works with ifttt which is a plus. Still looking for a prettier/more user friendly solution. Tried Trello, and that wasn't it either. If Wunderlist/whatever Microsoft turns it into had ifttt I'd jump back in a heartbeat.",
"Used many to do lists over the years and this one is (currently) top of my list.  One feature that is missing (hence 4/5 and not 5/5) is location awareness.  I would love to get alerts when I am in a specific location, area, store, etc that I need to do or purchase something.",
"I've only been using for about a week, but I enjoy it so far. I've also downloaded the chrome extension, and I like how it syncs so I can see my to do list on every device. I'm not quite sure what the purpose of Karma is, other than to gameify the app, and personally I don't use the different categories other than the inbox, but I can see myself using them as I get better acquainted with it. If I have any complaints, they might be that it's not an entirely intuitive app, but I'm sure there are tutorials somewhere on the internet that I could find--currently, I don't feel like I'm using Todoist to it's fullest extent. But I HAVE found it incredibly useful!",
Started spamming me immediately after installation.  Update: Unsubscribe button on spam a useless placebo. Have to jump through hoops to get it to stop.   Wish I could give this app a 1 star review daily for eternity.,
"I do like this, (however today there is a glitch - it keeps asking do I want to discard/save when trying to set priority etc). My issue is that I already have apps which are free that offer more or less the same range of functions. As I am only using it for personal reasons due to illness & related memory issues, I do not want to pay so much for it. I can see how for colleagues & work it would be worth while paying for it, I don't think there is anything that unique that justifies paying in my circumstances though. I do recommend you try this for yourself - it is not a bad app, just not the best option for me.",
The best organising app I've used.  Mind feels free no need to remember everything.  I can organise my work clearly as I freelance and juggle a day job. Great for adding reminders ahead of the year. I can't recommend it enough. I just use the basic free version I think that's more than enough,
"It's a simple to do list. You don't have to go through six screens to open and with one click the item is updated. Priority, reminders, and tracking is simple. Better than expensive ""planning"" packages to just keep stuff straight.",
"Works well, however reminders leave the task bar after a certain period of time and I can't work out how to change the time these reminders are on the task bar.",
"Use for work, my whole company is using it. Very good. I wish there was better ability to integrate with email programs on the Mac. To easily attach documents from Todoist to emails.",
"The app itself works great, tracks todos in a simple and very intuitive manner. I especially like that they kept it simple. You can use just the properties you need. For example, I use just due date and project. I don't need or want tags, priorities, reminders, etc.  The reason I rate it 3 is due to the painful integration of freemium reminders. If I push the wrong button, it pops up an annoying ""buy me"" screen, where the only way to dismiss is use the Android back button. I realise that the developing company needs to make money, but... does it have to be so intrusive? I would rather just not see the extra feature buttons.",
Edit : Add duration field and Gantt chart integration which support dependencies. I will go premium. Its not possible to use multiple app for tasks and todo's.,
"Fantastic app.  Only possible improvement would be fully adding desktop functionality on mobile, such as easy was to grab email link in order to send emails to projects as tasks.",
"Easy to use and does the job without a lot of extra organizing work. Make lists and check them off. I would like to be able to sort and reorder the list easier, though.",
Awesome app. Really helps me get things done and stay on track. All I would say is that the reminderz/notifications should be more customizable.,
"Better than Any.do, Wunderlist, or Trello. Paid for pro and I'm happy with it so far. -Update 2/24/2017- Some of the features that keep me using it are: -Recurring tasks to build better habits and as daily reminders -easy natural language input for due dates (like 'today', 'tomorrow morning', etc) which also apply to reminders -The Karma meter is kind of like a metagame (like xbox achievements), also the streaks (weekly and daily) which keeps me using it like fitbit's daily goals for getting things done. -The nesting feature within projects is a big helper b/c you can break up a task into its finer points and keep track of it that way. To me this is one of the best points of the app.  Still very happy with it and would recommend it to most anyone who wants to keep an organized and productive day to day scheduler in their pocket. ------end update--------",
"Simple but still delivers lots of features, all of them useful. Haven't tried premium yet but will switch pretty soon. Todoist is a joy to use.",
"I need to clarify my last review with an edit. Some functionality of the Windows 10 version of this app have gone away. The Windows 8 version worked perfectly, but when using the Windows 10 desktop version of Todoist, you can no longer search a task and then edit that task from the search results. Nor can you see or edit the reminder time once you have set it. If you have over a hundred tasks in your task list spanning 10 years as I do, this is an annoyance. Other versions of Todoist work well in these regards, including the Chrome extension and the smartphone app.  My work around it to go into the Chrome extension when I need to search and edit or check on a reminder. I wish Todoist would let you delete completed tasks.  They do not interfere with anything, and it is an intensional design feature so you don't ever loose tasks, according to the very responsive and helpful Todist support. Never the less, I find it annoying. Todoist support acknoledged the Windows 10 issue. All things considered, Todoist is still my favorite multi-platform task list program. The others multi platform task list apps don't come close. Yes, Wunderlist and Any.do, I mean you!",
"It provides a unique, easy to use and powerful interface for creating tasks and projects,  that I did not find in any other tasks and projects management applications",
Works across all my platforms. I enter a task whenever and wherever it comes up and find it on all my devices.  Keeps me organized and accountable.,
Todoist is really nice app... Me and my husband both are working so we make a list for things to purchase using this app and we remain coordinated with each other everytime.,
"ToDoList has been wonderful for work and personal organization. I started using for work as a way to collaborate with colleagues, and migrated to using for personal projects and general to-dos.",
"Simple interface does exactly what I need. Not many bells and whistles, but the mobile app keeps me on  track",
"It does what it says it does, nothing more and nothing less. I really like that if you say ""Tell me to do this daily"" it picks out the ""daily"" and automatically sets to remind you. Pretty cool.",
Every one including myself are on the job to finish it off .And it's so productive and like playing a game to finish the task assigned.100 percent accountability,
"Complete, easy to use but most importantly very fast, which is an absolute necessity for a to do app. You need something that opens instantly and lets you add stuff simply otherwise you just stop bothering.",
Absolutely love this entire program and app. Does everything a to do list should and more. The integration with Google is a life saver. Well worth the money.,
"Simple, easy to use, addictive. Perfect tool for collect all of my tasks and responsibilities into one place. Helps me to find my priority and my effectiveness.",
I think It would be better if your tasks don't dissappear after you've done them and you have them crossed out,
"This app is super easy to use and keeps your list clear and organized. If you are a ""to-do list"" person I would recommend this app.",
"Great support across any platform you can think of. This is one of it's biggest advantages, apart from being very very good.",
Links with Alexa great but would prefer a sound notification for an event rather than an email unless I've been missed it.,
"Setting up tasks is very easy, as is setting up reminders. For anybody who needs a consistent and reliable way to keep track of what they need to do, this app is definitely worthwhile.",
"Suits my purpose 100%. Being able to organise my day, reschedule and get email alerts on what tasks are outstanding, makes life easier.",
Awesome! I get so much done and feel better while doing it by tackling each item one at a time. It also keeps the little things from falling thru the cracks.,
Novice at the moment but am learning all the time with it. It's very easy to simply get started and then pick up features as you go along.,
"It's great, especially the little reminders it gives you. Very helpful if you've got a lot on and need a little help remembering.",
I think it's a great little app for task management. I wish sync across platforms was more consistent. Adding a create task affordance to the context menus for emails and other stuff would be more  awesome.,
"Not able to log in using email. I use Todoist on pc, but unable to login in phone. Phone : Xiaomi Mi5.",
UI is a little clunky but it's an extremely reliable and powerful to-do app. Mail integration is especially appreciated.,
"Nice App, hast everything you need and Premium Account is 100% worth it. It's a fair price. I love this app",
What I love is that it's intuitive and doesn't do too much. It's just a simple project and task tracking app. Works well for me.,
"Does what I need it to do. I really appreciate the email reminders. They're not for everyone, but they keep me up-to-date. I even started using it for work!",
"Bug: In the Today list i cant attach 1 row to other. If i do it in the Inbox list, in the Today list rows dublicates: 1 attached and another unattached. If i delete unattached row attached deletes too. (Sorry for my crappy english)",
"This is seriously my favorite platform. I run everything through it: work, fun things, notes, everything. I don't know what I would do without it.",
Im getting used to the UI after switching from Wunderlist. I love the IFTTT integration so I can use with my Google home. Will likely be five stars after I use it for a while.,
"Easy to add tasks and items and even easier to reschedule them when life gets in the way. Used this for my wedding planning but now I use it for work, home, and college.",
"I personally think that something could be more easy, as setting the time for a personal event. It's not so friendly for the user.",
"Works on my pc, that's the only reason I have it. Doesn't event understand the concept of deadlines. By deadline concept I mean it should remind you that you have to do it by that time. Not that it's scheduled for that time.",
"Keeps me focused, exactly what I need. Easy to use, easy to find your way around the app. Perfect for busy lives",
A great way to keep organized. Used it to make sure I didn't forget to pack something for my trip. Worked wonderfully.,
"Helps me prioritize and organize what I need to do. And, offers the ability to share that with others. A must have productivity app.",
Great app. Very useful even without going for the in-app purchases. The reminders have been very good in helping me stay organized.,
Really simple and easy to use. Like the fact it breaks down large bullet pointed paragraphs into seperate tasks. Really has helped my productivity!,
"It can be a little difficult to set up and troubleshoot repeat tasks, but once you learn how it works, entering tasks is quick and efficient.",
"LOVE the tiny but full featured home screen widget. Overall best in class set of features for a free user, and I'll go paid soon  former RTM user.",
Probably already written before but what keeps me coming back is the ability to type the date and time right into the note. Saves a step and tom is my favorite function as a procrastinator. Anyways excellent app!,
"Definitely worth checking out, haven't explored it enough to give better feedback yet.  Mostly use it for family grocery list linked with Amazon Alexa",
This is one of my favourites. I use it on home and work devices. I just skim the surface of what it can do but no complaints. Thumbs up!,
"Simple to use and quite convenient - especially through the 'add a tast' gadget But I would like it even more, when done tasks stay visible and aren't deleted",
"I was brought here from cortex and I got to say, I only used this device for about a week and my productivity sky rocket to a whole new level. Definitely a must have for anyone looking to improve on productivity. Thanks for helping me get my uni life back in order.",
Needs login information to allow me to take a note. Paper works better than this app. I dont want to have the notes online.,
"The app is amazing, easy to use and does what it says. I believe it either needs getting used to or the archiving feature is buried a bit far.",
"The best todo list app.  favourite feature: synchronisation between windows, web and android is very much useful for me.  Thanks todoist team",
"Great useful app. I like how i can add tasks above and below a specific taks under my general lists, but also gives me the ability to add tasks to different project lists. If u are looking for an app that separates ur job/business lists from ur personal list, it has the flexibility to do so because u can use a ""project"" list as a personal or business/job tasks list. Its very user friendly and i recommend it to everyone.",
"Best to do app out there. Allows you to keep it simple or create big projects as required. Just be careful as my first impression was it didn't do comments or sub tasks, but it does both in the free version (just share your project to get comments).  I tried loads of these apps and very pleased I made the switch",
"Took a bit to get used to, but really enjoy the functionality. Much easier than carrying around a planner.",
"I have used Google Keep, Evernote and five to seven other to-do apps. However, none can compare to Todoist. This to-do app is simply THE BEST. The best part about this app is the setting of priorities and deadlines, and then being able to see it in a seven day deadline sorted view...simply amazing.",
Todoist does not allow the insertion of a date into a task.  Todoist did not reply to my emails asking for help.  Todoist sends too many emails but did not see fit to respond to my request for assistance,
"Great app. Feature-set perfectly aligns with GTD, with the labels and filters available. I wish it had filters referentiable in other filters though.",
When they expect you to pay for premium version in order to get complex features such as notifications (sarcasm) you know something's very wrong. Uninstalled and never to be reviseted again.,
Very happy with this app.  It's so easy to use and of course is usefully enough to manage your daily to-dos and projects. Thank you so much guys for this tool.,
Sometimes we need external help to keep our life in order. This app does just that. It would be even better if it could be linked to our inboxes.,
"The app seamlessly integrates a to do list, a reminder app and a calendar app.  I especially like and use the recurring task and the project functionalities.",
"Simply the best to do list type app out there.  It has loads of features a special one being you can write the date in number of days. Simply amazing, I switched from all other forms of organization and bought the premium. It's so worth it too because of what this app can do. I would like to see a full calender though. Love this app 5/5 will use it forever.",
"This has radically improved my workflows for business, college and just personal life. I'll be a user for life I'm sure",
This is a great app to keep you on track and focused. Helps me to out systems for priority and followup in place easily and conveniently. So good I even paid for a yearly subscription. Highly recommended!,
"Great app, held back by lots of features only available in premium version. Annoying.",
"Well, it is okay, but I just can't wrap my head around the decision to make viewing completed todos a premium feature? I sometimes complete a to-do by mistake but guess what - it costs money to view it and reopen. How is that so advanced to require $$$?",
Great app that allows arranging tasks into groups. One downside is that the interface isn't the easiest to get used to.,
Great app it keeps me on track. A few minor changes i would make but overall very helpful and pivotal in helping me get task done,
"The app works great once you figure it out. Some functions are easier  on the app than the pc version, but the reverse is also true. I use todoist for projects, to-do lists, and to track things. It works great for everything I use it for.",
Definitely a good start to getting organized. I like detailed apps but it must be easy to use w/out instructions and this app does the trick!,
"Simple! Like the paper slips you've been carrying around,  only better",
"Committed to this tool for a 30 day trial to see how easy it could implement GTD and sync with Google calendar.  On a tablet, editing a task takes too many operations, and it is not ergonomic.",
It's a great tool. It has some bugs like the widget for android keeps changing the order of my tasks but other than that minute issue it's great!,
"Crap. I was looking for something to create a shopping list easily with echo. This is beyond rubbish, it is far easier using a pen and paper.",
I have been using todoist for over 3 years and been enjoying the experience. The simplicity of the UI is what keeps me at it and the availability on almost all the platforms. Awesome work team!,
I like that I can break down different steps for different projects. Makes a big list not so overwhelming. Like eating an elephant ... One bite at a time!,
"Cool app, haven't really opened it up fully.  Kind of not into paying then app disappears.",
"Does everything I want. Premium is kinda expensive, but the the free version does everything I need.",
Great stand alone functionality. Really have to pay for it if you want it to be worth a darn. Can't set reminders without payment. so it's as about as effective as a pen and paper until you do.,
New layout with great synchronize function. Can help managing tasks list on different devices and workplaces. Good for speedy reminder too,
"Making life easy, no longer forgetting tasks and encouraging me to get more done.  Awesome app.",
"Tried many task management systems but none as friendly, powerful and fast as this one whether on mobile device or desktop. Thank you.",
I don't want email just a simple To Do list. So this app does not do what it says on the packaging,
Dubious Privacy Requires an account. No option to keep all your personal data local. Requires one to determine the privacy options and then totally trust the backend personnel and cybersecurity standards.,
Amazing app! Add more 'smart' features so it can win the battle against apps like Ike,
"very good app, I use it on my PC as well as on android device. tracking work is now more easy. thanku",
The functionality is great. The only thing missing is to cancel tasks that are no longer relevant. But I love the organisation and reminders.,
"Good app so far.  I'm still trying to understand all features.  Would like it to be a little more ""persistent"" in reminding me of task!",
The best to-do list money can buy. The premium subscription is nothing consodering how much I use this app daily.,
As a kid I was slightly autistic. As an adult Im so glad this exists I wouldn't be able to multitask ever,
Very nice app to manage tasks. Best thing is that we can share tasks with our team members.,
Great tool! Now to figure out how to sync with Google calendar.  Update. I'm liking this more everyday. It's been updated several times without glitches. Great development team.,
"Good app for to do list management, however, they don't yet have the split right re which and how many functions are available in the free version. Even basic time reminder functionality is reserved for the premium version...",
"A Great App to keep track of your commitments and projects!  So far, I am just using the free version, but it is pretty capable at keeping me on top of my Top List, rather than the other way around.",
Very nice app and it give me very organise life. Its function to syn to all device is marvellous. I have to just check out when i do that work from any device and done. Thank you developer for these marvelous work.,
"It really is super simple to use. Now that I'm using it, I rarely ever miss an assignment or forget what I need to complete.",
"The only aspect limiting this application is the missing home screen notification widget, just like other competitors have",
Any app that forces the user to create an online account without necessity does not deserve consideration.,
Recently switched to Todoist from Pocket Informant due to thier lack of Android updates. Wow! Wish I would have switched a year ago. Well worth the Premium upgrade.,
"Takes a bit of set up, but this is my favorite productivity app. I love how easy it is to sm quickly type in a to-do item. Use the shortcut on your desktop for quick add!",
"Went premium after just a three week trial. This is easily the easiest to use, most comprehensive and interconnected task management app I have ever used. Love it.",
Once again I am no longer able to change the order of the tasks on my android phone.  Makes this almost unusable.  Can still change the order on Chrome on desktop.  Tried reinstalling- still doesn't work.  Seems to have happened after a recent update or daylight savings time.,
I use it it for home and work.  Love how I could send me reminders based on location. Couldn't live without.,
"Latest update is broken. Today/7 day view won't auto rearrange based on priority, and I can't manually rearrange it either. IPhone hasn't been affected, so at least I can use it there.",
"Awesome app that helps keep my life under control. Great interface, and works on all devices",
Useful App but most important feature is used premium and premium is not cheap (reminding feature). So I'm gonna delete this App after submitting this comment bye,
"*Upgraded to 5 stars for adding project notes. * A note area in the project title is essential please. Ability to hover on project title and be reminded of the overall brief,  key info and aims. Thanks.",
Program and website work great together. Also works perfectly with Alexa (Amazon Echo). Would prefer to see it  to also integrate with Google Calendar and Outlook. Wunderlist's integration with Outlook is horrible.,
"This app is really awesome - it has a very clear layout, easy organisation functions, and is really useful for remembering both my every day todos and more complex tasks. It has made me so much more productive.",
Used a number of to do apps & methods over 10+ years... todoist is the only one that has stayed top of the list - my number 1 to do app / method for years!,
Easy to use and keeps me better organized than anything else I've ever tried.,
"Easy to use, no clutter, but I reverted to my old app, it doesn't really help without reminders.",
"It takes a bit of time to learn how to use it, but it is worth it. I like that completed tasks gets you 'points' and let's you level up, so it's kind of like a task based game, but in real life.",
"Of the two options offered for integration with Alexa, this to-do app is the only one that worked.  So far, ToDoist has been seamless, even offering a separate shopping list dedicated to Alexa.  Also, all daily tasks scheduled by Alexa appear in your list annotated ""Alexa.""  No confusion as to where they came from.  If you have Alexa, this is probably the easiest to-do app to install and use.  Using the Amazon Tap device.",
"Love the simplicity of it. You can add priority, projects and deadline while entering task without having to press somewhere else. Easy to use on pc as well. Only downside is you have to update to premium to see completed task",
I have looked for years for a to do app that actually helps make my life easier. This one does. Worth every penny!,
"Awesome cross platform tool. Being able to see tasks in Outlook, dictate a quick note to self on my phone, or check out tomorrow's agenda on my tablet has been fantastic.",
Keeps me motivated all day.. Gives a feeling of satisfaction once I reach a goal or guilt if the app shows postpone.. UI is mot complicated and that's the best part..,
"I love this app and the web browser! I recommended it to my fellow teachers and my classmates! It's perfect for balancing work, school, and personal items!",
"Easiest of task lists I've used, integrates with email for notifications, repeatedly reminding you of what needs to get done.",
This is the exact app I was looking for. It doesn't let you forget anything until you finish this task.,
"I just started using it, but in the last week, I've used it every day. Easy to use and gives me reminders. Love it!",
The app should have an option to automatically display time sorted list of tasks in the widgets on home screen.,
Great for keeping on top of tasks. Really motivating being able to see number of tasks completed at the end of the day and colour codes for projects. Reminders are really useful for specific tasks. Highly recommend,
It really helps me organise my life. I have different list for work and home. It means that were ever i go i can update my jobs. It's especially good for my job as a PA as i get jobs in random places and random times. This app means i never forget the jobs.,
"I've been using Todoist for a couple years, it simply helps me get things done.",
"Poor Widget in Android went to TickTick bc of this.  Like everything else, even the online blog is great.  Good development support!",
I have been using the paid version for a few years and I don't know what I would do without it.,
First tracking app that has stuck with me. Great job!,
"Useful app, have used it for over a year, sometimes the more complex repeating tasks can be difficult to schedule, but I usually get it to work after a try or two",
"The very best to-do app on the market. Simple to use but powerful if you want it to be. Pleasing on the eyes. Available practically everywhere, so you always have your reminders with you. Free version feels complete, yet the premium version offers so much more.",
"Easy to use, sends reminders to remind me how overzealous I was in creating my to do list...",
"Great time management tool.  Could use more funtionality, but that can sometimes slow down interaction and increase learning curve...  I like it, i use it, its awesome..try it",
It'd be nice to have check boxes and also show all tasks at the same time (more than 7 days out).  I like that it can sync with alexa,
"Nice app with all the main options I need... available in Premium only. Especially reminders - those make half of the purpose of the apps like this, should be available in free version!",
Helpful but can't print?  Web broswer only spot with very limited option and prints blank page with title?  No auto sort?  Have to hit sort button every time to stay in priority order?  Feels like a beta program.,
"Generally good interface. A little hard to batch edit or customize views, but the website has the same problem.",
"Love the app (had the widget on my homescreen for years) but premium just seems a little overpriced for me, I'd happily upgrade if the price was lower...",
Seems legit. It's just the event addition function that seems too complicated.,
"Very useful on individual and group level tasking. Love the rescheduling options, attach photos and comments features.  Using it second year now and loving it even more.",
Incredibly crisp and honestly life changing if you use it well. I use this during meeting instead of a note pad.,
"Good app, schedules reminders and syncs across devices. I like that it suggests how or when to schedule a reminder with a unique design.",
"It's ok, as a new new user I'm still getting to grips with it but the free version is pretty limited.",
Easy to use! Keeps me organized. I wish I could set off timers /alarms without paying for it though,
"Everything I need to know and do in one app available on all devices. Thank you! PS, love the Karma and Goal tracker!",
"Once I looked into the time tagging I found this to be an amazing to-do list app. Tried many, stuck with this!",
Probably best-in-class and does what it does very well. Might try the premium features.,
"Its convenient. The app is user friendly, if you struggle to manage time, why havent you gotten this app yet? Its notifications are subtle yet still reminding you. Best app Ive come across for helpung to balancing your time.",
Misses a timetrack for the app (only as addon fir browser). Other thne that really great tool.,
"It truly helps keep important tasks to the forefront of my brain, even when days get extremely hectic.",
"It's easy to use, and actually encourages me to get things checked off with its feedback.",
"Since it came with my mate 9 I tried it. Surprisingly, since I use this app I really do all my tasks without forgetting / being too lazy. It's a very easy to use and compact app.",
The best part of Todoist is all the keyboard shortcuts and the way it synchs almost real-time across multiple devices. One of those apps which has not disappointed me after subscribing to the paid version.,
Super useful!! this app helps a lot with my time management and priority skills.  I wouldn't be able to make it without the app. Highly recommended!,
It's good to track group project. But can't assign one assignment to multiple ppl.,
"Good app, easy to use, but I wish I could sort the list with the most recently created tasks on top.",
Perfect for forgetful people like me who needs a to do list to accomplish anything.,
"With tags and projects, you can really implement GTD more fully than other list managers.",
Amazing app! Takes a little but of trial and error at first but then it just gets better,
I luv lists!  Basic App does what it is supposed to do. My calendar's  reminders work for me a tad bit better. This app's list doesn't look like a list more like a sentence. Evernote displays better.,
"Works well, minimally intrusive, not a fan of the add on model for additional features, but easy enough to avoid",
"App Looks good, but difficult to migrate from Keep to this one. If at all they provide automatic feature.",
"With a cheap subscription, you can do all the things!",
"It has been the easiest app of it's type to use for our family. We have begun using it for work, church, & personal. So far we love it!",
Easy to use! Love that you can add others to collaborate on lists. Also love the ability to make a list a parent of another! Works awesome for packing!,
Great app for keeping track of a to-do list. Sends you emails of items as well.,
"Best ToDo list app out there, beats Wunderlist and Remember The Milk hands down.",
Very helpful app.  Reminders are great.  Helps me stay organized.  Definitely need that with my hectic life!,
"It's a really handy app! It works quite well for me. I'm going to try the trial of the full version however, since some of the features behind the pay wall seem to make todoist a lot more useful and versatile.",
Syncs well with Amazon echo & the daily reminders help massively with my forgetful baby brain!,
Great and useful tool for work and home tasks. I've been using it for two years - satisfied.,
"Very good interface. I liked the ""7 day"" option. But most of the basic features like reminders are Premium features.",
"For almost every function i clicked on, it popped with a premium feature needed",
"Really really useful, just wish you can do a little bit more without updating to pro",
Great app for keeping track of your day to day life. Simple and easy to use. Has a built in point system which encourages use,
"It is great, still trying to use it midst efficiently, but the issues are with me, not the app.  ☺",
"It's ok ,for some basic features like reminders or labels have to be upgraded to premium version.",
It has really helped me recover my productivity! Plus I can easily manage my teams. Already enrolled four people to todoist. Way to go!,
Awesome. What I like most is that it's very user friendly with gestures support. Everything can be done quickly.,
Intuitive. Elegant. I've experienced increased productivity and decreased stress using this app. Thanks.,
Easy to use. Can create numerous project with and cross reference btw projects. There is also the availability to create sub-tasks.  Love this apps! Make my various tasks trackable!,
This is fantastic. Im trying it out for 6 months and if it makes the cut am getting the premium version.,
"love the app, love the widget. really useful and helps me to be productive! please add the widget sort feature, will be more awesome!",
"Switched from wunderlist,  to sync with alexa. Not bad getting used to it.  Strange everything in projects.",
How to fake being a functional adult in two easy steps: workflowy and todoist.,
This app makes your to do list a little more fun by giving you points for completing your tasks.,
I am a lists' person.. so this app is just perfect for me.. plus it reminds you to review your list so you don't forget to check off things you've done !!! Helps me function efficiently and makes my life hassle free,
Take a lot off y mind to be able to put things down on a list and wait to be reminded of them in a timely manner.,
From many to-do list apps I find this one a perfect match between simplicity and complex feature mix.  I like the way it works. And it's fast (thinking of you google keep).,
"Does what the box says, and does it well. Sync w todoist on my laptop is very useful",
"Great addition to my work flow, I use the outlook add on as well and it works great.",
Todoist is very complete and super easy to use. Their android app is perfect. Been using it daily for 2-3 years now.,
great app! due to gamification I get so competitive and really wanna finish my task or else I get negative karma,
Doesn't work at all. App quits on trying to login with Google. Not recommended.,
Good app. Still learning how to use all the features. More explanation would be useful. Keeps me on track with to do list,
Exactly what I need to track everything. Love link to emails and the ability to dictate notes on the run.,
"Its great, pushes a lot of notifications so it keeps you busy and the widget is nice as well.",
Please enable the widget to sort by dates due!  I dont want to be flicking through the to do full of stuff ages away for stuff thats due now. It only makes sense!  Thanks,
Sleek-looking and easy to use - Todoist is a great app for task planning and time management.,
"Before ai discovered Todoist, I was a very productive person and could easily multitask. Todoist made my productivity increase tenfold and gives me the peace of mind that I am  accomplishing my tasks. Love this app!!!",
"I rate this as one of my top 3 productivity tools. Peter Creed, Business Mentor and Life Coach.",
"Really great tool for creating, managing, and collaborating on tasks. Clean and easy to navigate interface/UX.",
Love the integration. Especially with my echo. Have task and shopping list everywhere I go. User friendly. Great basic app.,
"This has been a great app so far, still haven't delved enough into it for a 5 yet",
I'm willing to pay for a to do list but £22 a year is way too much.,
Easy to use. Only thing i regret is that there aren't any reminders,
Solid piece of software. Usable even in the free version. Not so much junk functionality in the way of productivity.,
Great app. Just too expensive with premium version 😯,
"Nice 5 stars, but I'm not willing to spend a full £35",
If your looking for a todo app then this is a great choice. An app and service that I think is hard to fault.,
"Great app, love the contextual text bookings, wish it understood 24h and more day-type commands.",
"Works well for me, but could be tweaked for a little more professional sophisticated look and feel.",
Excellent to do app. Very much recommended if you want to stay on top of your workload.,
"Language processing is an awesome feature, and Todoist available on all platforms I use. Switched from Wunderlist.",
"This is a great little app. Quick and simple to use, but I use it almost every day.",
I really like this app but for some reason it's not syncing my tasks between my laptop and Android phone - any ideas why?,
Fantastic! Easy to use and intuitive. It would be even better if your next 'to do' appears on you lock screen as well. :),
"It's a great app. Would be better if more options were available free, such as reminders.",
Best app to focus on tasks whatever the degree of your procrastination may be.,
Not perfect. But the best to do app I've ever tried. Really.,
Most of it is great but losing the list of what has been done is making me explore other apps.,
Life is disorganized. Todoist helps add order to that chaos.,
"Almost literally saving my life. I used to worry endlessly about my to do list, now I don't need to because I know it's in todoist. I never have to worry about syncing, it's always up to date.",
So easy to use.  I like that it will alert me on my tasks. Game changer for certain!,
"REMOVED APP, TODO LIST ANY.DO IS WAY BETTER notifications, snooze and other much better features...Task reminders come a day later than scheduled (time zone bug?), so appointments are missed. I'm never going to pay extra SORRY GUYS had to be done!",
Good but it needs to have an option for things that need to get done within a few days,
Free version doesn't seem to integrate with Google Tasks.,
Great app.I like the way it gives reminders for overdue tasks within the emails.,
"Amazing! Simple and effective, great for planning ahead and being more productive, highly recommend any student to try it :)",
"Not as good as Wunderlist, but better than others.",
Best to do list tool I've used.  Multi-platform cloud based approach very handy.,
Its complicated at first but once you know how it's a good app,
I love that you can organise your life into projects and sub projects. Its easy to use and it has colours!,
"Very good app, I can use it seamlessly across all my devices.",
This darn app won't let me forget things! Yippeee,
"Very good app, Looking to see notification as free option !",
A learning curve but once that's done it is a great app for keeping on top of tasks.,
Waste of time. Everything pushes you to the premium version.,
"Great app for organizing works and personal errands, including projects, which helps to allocate and keep tracks of your works",
Helps me feel organized. And I've finally stop making 1000 lists for everything!!,
Takes some time to get used to but in the end it is the most powerful To-Do App I have ever used!,
"Pretty good thusfar, not the easiest UI, but full featured in the paid version",
Love that you don't have to use the power features to get a lot out of it.,
"Simple, clean and easy to use.  Just enough notification to be useful without being invasive",
"Takes time to get use to entering a task, but real easy when you understand how.",
Fits my work flow pretty good and it is taken care of every little detail.,
Link with Gmail is the best that I like about it. Appreciate if you could make it available in the Gmail app as well.,
I love my list to follow me. Finally a task manager that works for and with me!😍,
"Easy to use and does what it says. What else do you need?  Options make it easy to customize or turn off notifications, too.",
Great way to make reminders. I use it to manage payments to various banks and it's fantastic,
The UX it's too complicated for something that needs to bee very simple,
"I find this really great to keep track of things I have to do, but do find it annoying after most updates that I can't order my tasks how I want, I can't re order the tasks for today as they keep reverting back to the end of the list, can you please do another update to fix this? Thanks",
Great app! Constantly being updated. Very useful for keeping me on track.,
You're doing great! We need real software like this. Thank you,
"gives me a target on a daily basis, done more this week than I have in a month from reminding me to do it!",
Great tool! I know what has to be done and when its due.,
Great app to organize your Profesional and personal life. Go for it!,
"I use it for a few days, and I am very satisfied. I still exploring it, and find new features.",
Simple and effective. Motivates you to get things done.,
This app is exactly what I've been looking for. Affordable and no limitations on subtasks. Well done developers!,
easy to use and user friendly. The mobile version is even better. Good job 🖒,
"I wish the ""add task below"" feature was available via mobile. Otherwise, great app.",
Stupid time wasting app with no proper function..,
Best app ever. Lets you use it on your home screen itself.,
Life-changing. Use in combination with the book ' how to get stuff done for maximum effect'!,
I haven't been using it long but It's very useful. Easy to use and effective :-),
"Simply amazing. It's a to-do list app that doesn't just beat the competition, but annihilates it.",
Beautiful app! Wish it was a one time payment instead of a subscription.,
Great for assigning tasks and due dates to other project members. Very easy to use!,
Manages my different lists and projects easily. The app is great!,
Crap. Continuously tries to remind you of something you never asked it to remind you off.,
Perfect for setting up quick and non-intrusive reminders. The tag system is great.,
By far the best Todo app out there. I am soon to reach enlightenment,

"The most frustrating thing is the behavior of the back button. You change a project, press back—app closes. You change pretty much any view and after pressing back the app will close. This is very inconsistent with the behavior of the rest of the apps on Android e.g. Google Inbox. After accidentally closing the app for the 10th time I had to uninstall it.",
This app has changed my life and is worth every penny for the premium version. I have tried other to do apps and this has the most features applicable to everyday life. I also love the help tools and articles available to help you maximize the potential of this app. I'm astonished at how much I can accomplish day to day.,
"It's a great app, I never forget to do anything, easy to use and simple. Just a suggestion, when crossing something out of the list, it shouldn't disappear, it should stay because it's satisfying to know that you're getting stuff done. Do that and I'll give you 5 stars.",
Update - I love this app. It only keeps getting better!  1) I hate the super slow scrolling between the list of projects and the task list for individual projects (once a project is selected). It is too slow and if you accidentally select the wrong project then it is really painful to go back to the project list and then select another project 2) I wish that the tasks were listed in order of priority. Having higher ranked items at the dead bottom of the list kind of defeats the point of selecting the priority level for each task,
It's quite convenient to use. Interesting thing is that all overdue tasks will always first appear when opening the apps,
Its clear value is I no longer worry about stuff.  This app is so easy to write it all down and off my mind.,
I never give my review for any app. But this time i forced to do because of this app . This is very good app which help to improve my quality of work ..,
I am using this every day. I was using tasks on my calendar but then I changed my phone and couldn't find tasks so I got this and I really like it. Good work!,
Great for keeping your lists on all your devices. I'm being way more productive than before and I stopped forgetting tasks.,
Great App there is always room for improvements with setting time and date etc but it is great app and program. I am staying on top of things.,
"Nice, I like the integration with Alexa, but it seams a little too busy. I could do without the rating system and encouragement.",
"I like being able to set priorities. Well made app. Kind of bummed about the steep premium price, especially since you need that for reminders. This app is overall more easy to use than Wunderlist IMO, and more aesthetically appealing.",
"Simple and easy to organize my to-do list. As a workaholic, this is the perfect way to organize my tasks.",
"I love the Todoist organizational web and use it as the framework for my work.  Having an app that mirrors the structure I've established in my office so that I can always locate the next task before me at any time helps keep me grounded to my game plan.  Well designed, well thought out, and well executed.",
Not told that you can't view completed tasks without paying for the app until you go to see what you've completed. Angry that I can't see my completed tasks without paying.,
This app has made me very productive. I now get a lot of things done.,
"It works well, the only thing that is annoying is the email reminders. I don't need it and. I don't know how to shut it off",
Extremely awesome app. The best thing I like about it is its simplicity and it's availability on multiple platforms helping me seeing my tasks everywhere I go. God bless you!,
"I love being able to add tasks on the go! Great app to help me stay on top of things, both at work and at home.",
Useful. I was looking for something g to help me sort out my weekly schedules and it helped. Only it doesn't provide for a re-occuring schedule,
Got bo quarrel with tis app. So far its been very helpful cool stuff,
I can't figure out how to enter tasks for the next days. Not as user friendly as it could be.,
"Great app for organizing.  I've used Wunderlist too, they're both good; but Todoist seems to have more functionality and I like the design more.",
"Todoist is so easy to use and syncs seamlessly with the online, Mac app, and iPhone versions. The widget is SUPER customizable and the UI is so user friendly. 10/10 would recommend.",
"Easy format, the only thing I'd change is to make separate lists for tomorrow, 2 days from now, etc but that's something a calendar or another list can do fine",
"Neat little app. Got it pre-installed with my Huawei P8lite. Only using it a short time and so far, I've been pretty satisfied.",
A little complex but worth the effort to master. Has definitely boosted my productivity yet reduce anxiety over what I need to get done.,
"Solid app with tons of integrations. Recurring tasks, attachments, notifications, and email task creation are all extremely helpful options. My only complaint is that there is no task detail field and all details need to be added as comments.",
Easy to use. Love how my husband and I can share grocery list and project lists! Each of us can add to or check off the same list. Just what we were looking for.,
One of the best organising/productivity apps. Surprisingly deep functionality when you get into it. Works and syncs across many devices.,
"Its help for me because it help me remind things that I need because sometime I forgot school work like assignments,projects,etc.",
"Great app! Works flawlessly across all platforms, and the premium subscription is well worth the upgrade for a very low cost.",
"Over night, it seems that the ability to write comments for items/tasks in lists is now a ""premium"" feature. Not happy about that move at all.",
"The best to do app I have seen (Astrid was close to as good though didn't have the labels, but it is out of business). Better than Wunderlist (which is pretty good itself) hands down. Premium definitely worth it!",
"Great app, but I'm really not into the idea of a paid subscription to get premium features. I'd happily pay a one time purchase price, however.",
Free version is fine.  Don't use it for teams!! it is simply full of bugs and sync problems. Useless for team cooperation,
"I was using Ever note before this for tasks, which was fine but cumbersome. Tks works better!",
Been using it for quite a while now. It would be nice to have an option to add a memo in a separate project category.,
Simple to use. Good reminds for things past due you forgot to do.,
"The only cross platform to-do app that allows for templates, a must for anyone who manages larger projects.",
"Works very well, fast syncing between the mobile apps and desktop apps make this a super useful tool.",
Useful app. Might be helpful if it could import tasks from Google Calendar to keep all tasks in one place,
It's good at keeping me organized! I like that to do lists can be separated into different categories.,
"Still working on using app on a regular basis, but find it easy to use and very convenient.",
"Use it everyday for school, personal use, and to manage a business! By far the best app to keep myself organized and more productive! I'm not sure what I would do without it!",
Really useful and keeps perfect sync between laptop and phone app. Used for a couple of years now,
Takes the weight of wandering what I need to do next off big time,
"Using it over a year now, in love with this app. Cant imagine any of my devices without this app.",
Very impressed with how easy this is to use; works great with alexa.  Very fast and responsive.  Intuitive set up.,
This app is very helpful in the constant fight against procrastination...,
Best to do app by far. And this is coming from someone that has really tried them all.,
Light and sweet app which does what it's supposed to do. Keeps u reminding in a way u like,
Paid for premium and have used the app for the last week. Customer support has been non responsive to tickets and barely exist. How do I get my money back?,
Excellent! Ive tried several task management tools and this is by far the best.,
I use this app everyday to organize my to do list. One of the best apps out there!,
"The best to do app I've tried. Very reliable, cross platform, easy to use.",
The interface and project system is perfect. Quickly becoming my favorite planning system.,
"Estou aprendendo ainda, mas é muito bom!",
"Very easy to work with, organises ur daily tasks and to do z",
Its change my productivity.  I am simply loving it thanks,
"Best task manager available for Android. Minimalistic & intuitive, with nice motivational touches.",
It's a good tool for managing day to day tasks and keeping your self on your peak performance,
This is what a to do list should be. Easy to use and doesn't disappoint.,
"Fast and clean.  But the ability to reorder tasks is a little buggy...  Other than that,  great.",
It really helps me keep organized with the tasks i need to get done.,
It does every thing and more!,
"Great for organizing your daily tasks. Easy, simple and fast.",
Don't stop and improve the app,
Think it is a good app but I do think price is a little high.,
The ifttt integration is awesome. Natural language is really good too.,
It is very helpful  It helps me to do not forget anything  Keep going,
Helps me a lot to do my stuff. Awesome!,
Very helpful for getting organized and especially frantically writing to dos before bed,
er utrolig bra at kan sende info til smart watch med den veldig fint for bibelen,
Thank you Todoist! I needed an app like this.,
Helps me keep my exceedingly busy life in GREAT order!!  AWESOME!!,
Great reminder of what I have to do though I haven't discovered all the functionalities yet. Is there a defer task option?,
"I love that it works on my phone, computer, in Windows, in Gmail, in Chrome, everywhere, and it all syncs!",
Way too expensive. Free version is useless.,
It's simple and does exactly what it claims to do... very helpful,
"Keeps me on track with tasks,  love it!",
"Az eddigi legjobb amivel találkoztam, minden alapdolgot tud és még van sok bónusz funkció is",
"Excellent tool for remembering, organizing, and planning work and chores.",
Kind of confusing once you get it and the user interface can become very confusing at times but once you get the hang of it it really is an amazing app to help keep track of day to day tasks,
If only the ulgrade was for free 😊,
Wonderful and effective! Never a problem.,
"Useful, but not always intuitive",
Very powerful organization of tasks across all my devices.,
Great way to organize thoughts and plan all necessary events!,
This is by far the best to do app I've found,
Great app for keeping track of tasks. Easy enough to use,
"Versatile enough to do what I need, and easy enough so I do it.",
Makes staying organized quick and easy...,

Simple and easy to use scheduling the daily task,

Simple and fast. I love it so far,
Really helping me organize my life.,
"Best app,  easy to use and very helpful",
Great app keeps me organised,
Very useful to stay organized thanks,
Great app to organize your life,
Keeps me super organized for college,
Works really well very intuitive,
"Too much trouble, too fussy.  And who nowadays can be bothered to type?  Removed.",
"Complicated at first, but very helpful",
"Even a Reminder for ONCE Today is PREMIUM $$ app feature. not even poor-man's ""reminder"" for Seniors/elders, Google. Is Any.do as restrictive of basic functionality ?",
"Easy to use, great features",
Great balance of functionality and notifications.,
Best To-Do App,
Excellent.. keeps me organized,
Best app I use.,
"Sleek, stylish, and easy to use",
Awesome to do list app.,

"I love the clean and simple experience. The interface is significantly less cluttered than most other to-do apps.   However, the latest update seems to have broken manual reordering. It doesn't work in the today and next seven days views and reinstalling the app doesn't help either.",
"Really wish the free version syncs with Google calendar.  The other premium features I don't need so much, but if I signed in with my gmail, why can't I just link to me calendar? Disappointed.  Might not even bother with this now. The premium $ to get my own calendar seems like a lot. Sorry. Other features seem great though.",
"I use this for daily tasks and also a wish list for books, films and places to visit. Works very nicely and easy to use across devices. Would suggest that sub tasks don't auto-expand each time a project is opened",
Our video production company started to use todisit in place of expensive and complicated project management software. It's incredible how helpful it is to keep the whole team on track and focused on their deadlines. We are a small team to efficiently is critical.,
Easy to use task tracking application.  The app adds a slightly easier to use interface over the mobile website e.g. one-click to add a task via notifications. Makes it as easy as possible to organise your life and the Karma points system encourages you to get into good habits. I think it's great :),
"I totally rely on it, running 3 independent operations in parallel. Without Todoist I would be lost in my to-do-lists",
"Easy to use, helpful categories, and syncing with other products. I've tried many productivity apps and this is my favorite so far!",
Does the simple things really well. Extremely useful for tracking tasks at a high level,
I think the layout is comfortable and easy to use but the email notifications can get annoying. You can unsubscribe from them though.,
"Three days in, I'm still extremely well organised, might update this review later on.",
The app is excellent!! I suggest the app for those people who want their work done before sleep,
Exactly what I needed— a to do list with due dates that has a repeat function,
This app has really helped me to organise my study and deadlines efficiently,
The FREE version helps me and my team manage multiple tasks and projects.,
awesome app.  does exactly what I need it to do.,
"Useful, lots of options to organize your tasks, easy to add tasks",
Great organization app to keep York  stuff togeather,
The best to-do list app ever.,
"Simple, no ads, does exactly what is described",
Handy little app!,
Very useful app.,
Love it!,

"Manual reordering is no longer working in the ""Today"" nor the ""Next 7 Days"" modes.  I am lost without this function.  When will this be fixed?  Also, the search option is not working since your latest update.  When will this be fixed?",
Absolutely brilliant app.,
Please Note: Most if not all of the favorable reviews are from users of the Premium (paid) App NOT the Free version! Pestered to review so...I just started using and had to pay for premium. Not sure it's gonna work for me yet but needed to see if it would and that required all the capabilities which meant buying Premium! :-\,
Like it. Very simple to add and view items. Would like to be able to to in with my calender.... update: I've  been using your app for a month and it's not only a one stop shop but also easy to add to now I've got premium and it adds to our calendars.,
"Todoist : my go-to app, absolutely Todoist is the best productivity app in Play Store, thank you so much for 30 days of premium features, I wish Dev could add monthly subscribe, I can't effort for annual payment but free features is more than enough. Interface is the key, I like the way Todoist show the subtasks, show how many tasks already done. Statistics feature is motivate me to add more tasks and finished them. Can't live without it.",
"Really loving it, finally relieved to not stress about remembering things.. It still takes me a while to find the right buttons to use for the date and time or project type but I'm getting used to it, soooooo grateful for it",
"After almost a year of actively using Todoist Premium, I can give an informed review.  While I love the fact that todoist has incorporated a natural  flow for writing tasks all in one line, and for having filters for automagically sorting your tasks(!), I can't help but find myself at a loss when I check my Karma graph for the 100th time, I would love to be able to access comprehensive stats like the year in review. Hopefully you're planning to expand in that way?  I would also like some incorporation of RPG elements, because after using Habitica, I can tell you that their way of gamification is very impressive. But I can see Todoist doing this better. Hopefully you are the type of company that would do something like this! Another reference of something is LifeRPG. Again, Todoist could do this better.   Nonetheless, thank you for your amazing product and hard work! :-)",
"(Free version) Excellent implementation! Wishlist/Suggestions: - a dark background mode for both desktop and mobile - more vivid colors for projects (the current colors are dull and not proper for colorblind people) - tighter lists (less spacing between lines) - see more, do more - possibility to sort by projects (with a discrete separator with the project label) - a mode where a completed task simply gets ticked and grayed out, until manually dismissed (the tasks would therefore work as a checklist, useful for recurring list-based activies - eg supermarket, other routines or mini-projects)",
"I really like this app. The idea is amazing and all the things you can do like due date, and changing colour is all amazing! But I had to uninstall it because I need reminders. And I live in a different country so I dont use dollars. Paying $27 a month for reminders is horribly expensive.",
"Intuitive, user friendly, clean and simple. I'd like to be able to put my list in a certain order, regardless of whether it has a time label or not, but it won't allow that. That's my only complaint! Great app.",
"Super easy to use and does what I want. It makes planning out my week much easier and it is really easy to organise tasks, and related tasks, as they pop up.",
Easy to use and has helped my productivity with better planning. I have not tried any of the sharing features as of yet so I can not comment.,
I use it for business and personal purposes. It is great to avoid procrastination and make things done. The notification system is not a pain like others. I tried at least other four apps for task management and this is the best.,
"Good little app, works well with Alexa Echo Dot and on my android. Free version is good enough for me. Does what it says on the tin :)",
"So far so good. Paid for subscription, not very usable without those features. Will review whether worth paying for additional features over other apps once I've been using it longer.",
"I've only used this for a week or so, but so far it is really great. Lots of features that I need to study more. Good integration with the Google ecosystem.",
Good app. Nice reminder emails. It would be good to be able to set times for the items on your list but mostly it's good.,
I love how it syncs to my laptop. The system is brilliant and easy to use. It's also not intrusive--it doesn't send notifications to me.,
"So far, so good. Premium is user friendly and is totally assisting me bluff my way through pretending to be an organized go-getter at my new job. Thanks.",
"Great app. Wish the sync feature was or could be automatically linked to phone calendar. Its kind of a hassle to copy an URL into my Google calendar, when that specific calendar is already synced with my phone.",
"Great mobile version of a great service, so far. I wish the UI was a little more compressed to show more on screen, but otherwise no complaints.",
This app could benefit greatly from a calendar view. Sometimes my to-do lists contain assignments that go beyond a week-to-week basis.,
"Would love to be able to add tasks from within Gmail and Inbox on mobile, but that might not even be possible. Desktop is unsurpassed.",
"I've used Todoist for only a few weeks, but so far I like it pretty well. I may bump it up to 5 stars after I have more experience with it.",
"I'm a premium and avid user, am satisfied with most features except that time altering UI. It's especially annoying when I'm trying to change the minutes without inadvertantly pressing the submit button.",
"Just started using this app.  Works well, but I would love to have all the functionality accessible on my phone instead of between my desk top and phone.  Asking for updates from the team is not intuitive to me, but overall, I like the app.",
"Not what I need. Looking for a list of suggestions, because I'm not motivated to make a list before I have to make a list. You make the list, and let me choose from it.",
"Unfortunately, I couldn't get the app to access Google/Facebook servers even though my Internet is working fine. I couldn't even sign up via the app.",
Literally making my life right now. Love the ability to categorize (and nest) my tasks and also mark dates/times as well as priority levels.,
"The learning curve could be more intuitive. I may have missed something, but I had to watch a few YouTube videos to get the basics. Better instructions may help.",
Wonderful app! Such a clean user interface and it does not interrupt you with countless notifications. I also tried Any.do before this and found this app better. Cheers to the UX designer of your team.,
"Mobile app is great, awesome to do list app with enough customizability to fit a lot of different lifestyles. Windows app is very poor however - download the Windows 7 version if you use Windows. The Windows 10 app has a ton of bugs.",
"It's pretty good, but I still feel like it needs something extra I can't identify to be perfect",
"The app works great! Does what I intended. It does have some limitations such as tags, reminders and filters for the free version.",
Excelente todo list app. Sincronização multiplataforma em tempo real com interface simples e prática. Uso a versão gratuita e estou satisfeito. Sincronizo tarefas com a extensão no Chrome p/ desktop em tempo real. Ótimo app.,
"Works well for what it does, but doesn't give reminders with the free version, which is the main reason I wanted it.",
Been using it for about a week and it seems pretty slick. If I still like it in a fortnight I'd consider upgrading to the paid service.,
The free version is already pretty useful if you just want a nice to do list with a way to differentiate between projects! I also like how well it integrates with other apps.,
"Love the app, especially the chrome add on in my browser. Wish there was a share option with other users.",
"Great organization. It reminds you about your tasks, even if they are overdue. Its great.",
Changed my life. I have never been more organized and up to date on my affairs/tasks. Perfect for anyone who is incredibly messy and needs to start getting their crap together,
Nice and easy to use. It gives you the option to categorize and has email and notification reminders for your day.,
"Best task management app I've used, with every feature I could possibly want.",
Almost akin to a gamification of your productivity. Clean and sleek design makes it very fun to organize your task and projects,
It would have certainly been better if completed tasks were visible in the free version.,
The Karma and the reschedule feature really works otherwise it leads to a lot of tasks with due dates just lying untouched for ages!,
Keeps me on track to keep progressing. I can do more in a day reach my goal.,
Very useful now that I purchased pro version. Versital and across both PC & phone. Well done programmers!,
Does everything I need it to. Simple to use. I use it with my smart watch and voice recognition. Works great!,
Helps me crush tasks! Love the integration with Outlook too.,
"Easy to use. I got it because of the way it integrates with the Amazon echo, which works perfectly",
Me a LOVE IT. one of the best out of the MANY ive tried!,
"Quite neat. Easy to use, glad it is able to work with Alexa",
Excellent app! Helps me stay organized and on top of my daily task.,
A very useful and stylish application. Really enjoy using it. Nice work.,
Integrates with Outlook and a ton cheaper than Deja Office's Deja Cloud service.,
Only issue I'd like to see sorted is easier manipulation of multiple items,
Better feature and UI than Wunderlist. Pro version totally worths the price.,
Great app! It's really useful in daily work.,
Excellent for task management. Recomended for people who want to remember tasks and track the progress.,
Increased work productivity and organised task for around the house. Great mobile app,
We couldn't have organised moving country without it,
"I'm a simple man, I see simple yet powerful tool, I upvote!",
This is exactly what I needed to keep multiple jobs straight,
I enjoy the Premium version but used the free version for years and loved it.,
"Easy,  and has ""karma""  to maintain our productivity..  Hope in the next feature,  todoist has ""notes""  just to keep notes rather than ""todo""",
It's been really helpful. Keep up the good work!,
I really like the way it's organised and its usefulness.,
Can't use without email its stupid,
Thank-you todoist for very useful application.,
Simple to use. Integration with Google Calendar is a major plus.,
It simple & really effective with tracking and organizing my tasks,
Great for list-oriented planning freaks,
Best to do list app out.,
Great app. Easy to use. Nice sync between devices.,
"Dishonest permissions require email address,  otherwise ""Oops,  Can't connect to Facebook servers! "" Reporting as a violation of Google's TOS. *AND UNINSTALLED*.",
Nice little app. Useful for my purposes.,
The perfect to do list app!,
Really powerful yet simple to use.,
Love all the sync and plugin options!,
Lovely application very much user friendly,
Great love the synchronisation between computer and phone,
Great app to schedule and group team work,
The best Todo app available in the market,
Works great. Just what I was looking for.,
Great App that is at the very center of my workflow!,
Okay.  Would love a panoramic view of the week,
Works great for our team requirements,
Easy to use and has good features,
Really usable. Functions smoothly. Unirritating.,
"1st - free version doesn't even come with reminders? Seriously?   2nd - too many clicks to add times  But worst of all - 3rd - SUBSCRIPTION?!? A one time fee I get, but a YEARLY subscription?? You've GOT to be joking!",
The app I've been waiting for!! Hello piece of mind!,
Do you really need to pay for to use it as a reminder,
So far so good.,
Amazing. Exactly what I wanted.,
It works really well.,
Awesome... even the free version!,
The best task manager.,
Much better than expected.Congrats!,
Good App. Easy to use.,

"I like the app very much, it helps keeping you organized, but €28,99 per year is bizarre. I would have gladly paid anything under €10, but it's too much. Maybe you could add a level between premium and the free version for a reasonable price, with features like comments but perhaps without the option to collaborate on things, or whatever drives the price up so much.",
"I've been using Todoist for all my projects for 2 years. I like the projects focus,  the way of writing dates, the ease of adding tasks. I like that i can send emails to any project: this makes a difference.   Recently discovered the projects template feature so that I can set up all the steps of organising a training programme and then duplicate that for the next programme.   For a 5th star I'd like the possibility to email tasks or all tasks in a project from todoist ... either as pdf or just in an email.",
"There are lots of things to get done  everyday and I used to keep a paper to-do list, but I'd misplace it or forget about it. My phone is always with me (sadly) and the things I put on todoist stay on my front screen so I'm reminded throughout the day of what still needs to be done. It's easy and convenient.",
"Would be a 5 star review if there were a couple of team-friendly features  (like tagging in comments). Otherwise, it's great. Love using it for managing small projects and tasks. Things fall through the cracks less often now than before.",
I love this app because it keeps my to do lists up-to-date across all my devices. The language I can use to set recurring reminders is far better than any other to do app I have ever used. The integration with IFTTT allows me to easily increase my productivity with this app.,
"Their development team has been non-stop in improving all versions of the product (mobile apps, web, etc) - especially over the last year. Just had a bug in the Android version and I was so impressed this was fixed overnight.",
"I almost never pay for software like this. But I've also never found a todo list that actually works for me. I'm fine at writing the list, but I never manage to remember to look at it..... I decided to take the plunge and try the Premium edition and so far it's fantastic. I'm much more efficient and on-target than previously and it's only been a week or so! I'm really still only using the basic functions but it has been a huge change for the better.",
"Finally a reminder app that actually works correctly!  Does what you set it to do and sends messages/reminder to the correct device, eg. Phone, computer, tv. Etc. works most platforms and cross platforn, eg. Microsoft to Android, to apple, to lonovo to asus, brands, and many more not listed. GREAT JOB APP DEVELOPMENT TEAM!",
"I have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder which makes being organised a big problem for me and this helps me know day to day what I'm doing. Diaries I forget to look out calendars take alot of work inputting what I want to do. This makes things simple and straightforward. So much so that I am able to set something as complex as a holiday for myself, my wife and twin 5 year old boys which before I'd leave all this upto my wife. It really unloads the brunt of daily life off her shoulders.",
Asks for all the permissions from Google Play Services so if I don't have that it generates errors all the time. Other apps with the same functionality don't need these. Sometimes the input is buggy and the cursor skips to the start of the entry when making a new event. Otherwise good.,
"Simple, responsive,  intuitive. Allows you to get your thoughts out quickly but still offers the option to easily add them to folders and order them to your liking. Reminders and notifications work intuitively - they're there when you need them without being intrusive and are quickly completed and filed away. Great app:-)",
"Todoist's strength lies in its simplicity. Quickly add a task as it pops into your head, then sort it later by ""project"", assign it to someone else or pick the due date. I use it to manage my work tasks, but also keep a running list of books I want to read.",
"I got this (premium) off a humble bundle, and I really enjoy this app, it's a good to do list with some nice features and a productivity chart, but what saddens me is it's a year sub. You don't pay once and only once like I'd happily do, you gotta pay each year. And when this year runs out, I won't get another year, that's just how I treat these apps. It's their fault that the features are taken away after your initial payment, so I'll leave em with a year of use. Then I'll switch back to sticky notes..",
"Almost perfect.   Has a Gmail-esque interface, very clean and intuitive for the most part.  Very functional and useful, even in the free version. Wish I could give 4.5 stars instead.   Would like to see a system for setting tasks to every other day/week/month.  Would also like an option to set increasing priority on overdue tasks,  so if something is four days overdue, it has higher priority than something one day overdue.",
"I am self-employed and have about 4-5 different business streams that I am involved in at any one time. Keeping track of tasks and deadlines has been tricky, and I've used my phone's built in calendar, paper, post it's, etc to try to stay organized. With Todoist, I organize my tasks by project and it's much easier for me to keep track of deadlines. Push notifications are a real help, as us the ability to take notes on each entry.",
"Helps you take your life back into control. By itself this app is not enough. I am combining this app with making with a daily schedule on paper. Each morning  you can review your high priority items and the items that are due that day, and fit them in your schedule on paper. AFAIK there is no app which does a very good job of helping you make your daily schedule.",
"I utilise to-do list a lot, and I've tried many to-do list apps, but in terms of cross platform compatibility, user experience and lightweight-ness nothing quite beats this app, not to mention it syncs real fast too. The unique karma system is a neat ego feeder too.",
It would be cool if the app had a voice identification tool so you wouldn't have to type out all the things on your list. I agree with some other people in their reviews saying that the reoccurring setting isn't very easy to manipulate. So that's not quite as user friendly. But in every other way this is an awesome app. I'm a college student so I'm constantly having to map out dates and activities that I wouldn't have room for in a planner.,
"Ugh. Don't fix what doesn't need to be fixed. The new quick add feature is seriously worse than the previous one. Highly small and unreadable. It takes also longer to start. What it used to be a really quick tool, now it's slow and unusable.",
"I paid for the premium membership. And I very rarely pay for any app. But this app makes life easy by keeping it organized, and I found myself more and more often. I've even got my roommates using it now and it helps organize our chores and tasks. I use it for work, groceries, appointments, etc... just amazing.  One thing I would LOVE to see in is the ability to sync tasks to a calendar like Google. Or sync to other apps that track groceries like EatThisMuch. Integration is going to be selling points in the future, and I was tempted to switch to Any.Do due to their Calendar synchronization with Google which I use a lot too. But ToDoIst has got me hooked on their organization.",
"Labels, reminders, location-based notifications, file uploads, and automatic backups are completely standard features for almost every form of app made for organization for free! hear that, free! Google app, Evernote, Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote ect ect ect all do this for free. If you want to come up with something new and charge for it, be my guest . but to take a standard feature act like it's something special and charge $30 for it your going to destroy your business fast. What a RIPOFF! U wont last",
"I've been using Todoist for 3 years now; I tried many productivity apps before settling on it. Even though it lacks some features I think would be helpful, like setting start times and dates for tasks, it's flexible enough to be useful to both the novice and the power user. It's built on GTD principles, is incredibly customizable, and the karma points is a simple accountability tool that somehow hasn't lost its appeal. I recommend Todoist to anyone serious about GTD.",
"As a final year student of a five year degree it can be easy to get overwhelmed with the amount of work we have to do, especially with synoptic subjects, each one a bit different to the next. ToDoIst has helped me to organise my modules into projects, have sub projects and separate work from health from personal tasks. I think it's great so far, and it helps a lot with procrastination too. The best feature is that it's very easy to schedule things (today, tomorrow, daily, next week).",
It's a pretty cool organizing check list app. I know you have to be a premium member to have the full capacity to use this app and it's a yearly fee. But I think at least syncing the calender would be a cool thing with the free account. But then again it a great hook to get people to get the premium version. Just saying.,
"Todoist is hands down the best, not only ToDo list, but tool, to stay organized I've every came across. Absolutely amazing.  Things I like the most: - Really clean and easy-to-use design - Very useful integrations (loving the one for Outlook for example)  Keep up the good work!",
I am loving the app and I got it so my family could keep up with chores and we could get them done at a decent rate but it doesn't have all the features  I would like but the premium version adds some of the features I need like reminders but not features like allowing multiple people to access the one account and only view what they need to do which is a lot to ask for but all in all great app helps me and my family stay organized,
This was my favourite app for 2 years. For the last few weeks the widget has started to freeze. Can't add tasks or mark tasks as done. At first I used to remove and readd the widget. Now it is getting very frustrating. The team is also not responding to my ticket as well. So sad.,
Definitely helping me when it comes to two remembering appointments that I'm always forgetting to schedule little things like that that are in your mind every second when you're at work. The reminders in ice and the fact that you can set it with no date so it stays there I'm enjoying it,
"Just downloaded. Looks great, powerful. Was attracted to the location reminders  (powerful tool) - just one suggestion: could you provide for a radius around a location? I missed a reminder this week because I was a block away from the address entered. If you did an adjustable radius to allow greater advance notice when driving highway speeds, for example, I'd give it 6 stars. Thank you. Looks great, and great support and network...",
"Easy to use on my phone, pc and tablets! (PC & Mac) Thanks for a great product that works.  Haven't upgraded to premium and I love that the basic app is so robust.  Todoist helps me get things done at the right times and allows me to focus on things when I need to.  I value the peace of mind that it's all on my to do list and I will see it when it is time to address it.",
"Very usable while still having flexibility and powerful features, there if needed, unintrusive if not. Recently an issue where the app opens blank and needs to be killed to restore the view, assume will be fixed though. Recommend above all others",
All in all a very good app. I've been using this app for about a year now and it only gets better! Although recently I got a new phone (A9 Pro) and noticed that the app doesn't support split-screen view. Would love it if you guys can implement that feature for the next update! :),
"I was a Wunderlist user for 3 years, but when I couldn't get my Amazon Echo to work with it, I switched to Any.do.  Turned out that sucked too and had all sorts of sync issues. I then switched to Todoist and it has been working great so far.",
A nice balance between richness of features and simplicity of use and feel. I am not a power user and it has more than enough capacity for my needs. Helps me stay organized and to convert long term projects into a daily agenda.,
It's a great app with some wonderful features. It is really annoying though just how much of it is restricted without premium. I frequently hit buttons that it ends up not letting me use and gives me the annoying premium popup. I wouldn't mind paying for the app but I don't do subscription services,
"Liked the app and got my lists set up trying out the free version for about a week, then in an update they took away a favorite feature (filters)  and restricted it to Premium only.  Was it sneaky that they didn't openly list this change but included it in the catch all last item ""and more""?   How do you think that makes me feel?  I don't trust you. Uninstalling.",
Excellent tool in mapping out my day and being sure thing s don't fall through the cracks. It was highlighted in Tim Challies book on Productivity. His help in  setting up the app has helped me greatly...it has so much to offer!,
"What a piece of junk (for our needs at least). ZERO customer support. No phone number to call and no emails returned. And you want to charge me money? Simple features are lacking such as being able to lock a list with sub-tasks. Nah, no one would ever want to actually lock a list of something they are constantly doing with ever changing sub-tasks. Put an asteric in front of it! After loosing my list twice trying that, nice one. The free version might be great for you, but do not waste your money, these guys clearly do not want to offer a service for a cost.",
"Finally, a time mgt app that I can use across all my devices, including an Android phone, an iPad, and a PC. And it allows me to tag and label each task with multiple labels. This means I can sort tasks according to category, priority, time required, due date, energy needed, etc, etc. Literally for me am answer to prayer.   My only frustration is that the repeat function for tasks doesn't appear with the calendar, so if I don't initially set up a recurring task as, say ""monthly,"" it takes me some tweaking to modify it as such... But initial task entry, including an inbox feature for quick entry of any/all tasks that may come to mind, is dynamite!",
Lets me drag and drop tasks into projects and days very easily. The scoreboard is fun and motivating. This is my first stop every workday. My productivity has improved 2000% since getting this app,
"Working great so far. I've only had the app for days, but have been using the browser version for months. The app is a bit smoother and very efficient.",
"Here is a review after I used the app for over two years (one year free, one year paid, back to free now).  The app is great, definitely my favorite to-do app after trying out over 5 others, and having a bad time managing my time.   Free version highlights: - good minimalistic interface  - frequent updates - shortcut support  - custom natural language queries - smart re-scheduling based on AI algorithms  - priority sorting - good search for custom filters - nice karma point system for game junkies  Paid version highlights: - supports @tags - calendar syncing - custom filter support - good project support for multiple users  What I would love to have: - custom and more complex keyboard shortcuts - custom priorities + colors - more custom colors for projects (see Life Calendar colors for example, I want to have those) - have the calendar sync be a free option (just to get people in) - add some icons, like in Wunderlist - would like to have more graphs - (Web version) Add a button to move to a project when editing a task  Leaving it at 5 stars knowing the devs like to listen and we'll see updates eventually. Recommend it to any programmer,  and others.",
Glad I settled on the best after all my shopping of to-do apps. Always updating and improving and integrating.,
Good app and good support from the developers when issues occur. I use the free version - I'm sure the premium version is more feature rich.,
"Good scheduling,  easy to postpone tasks to later date,  combines pretty well with outlook on pc.  It doesn't create an extra 8 hours a day  but otherwise pretty good...",
"Gone are the days of having a separate diary for a to do list. As this works offline, I can update my to do list one handed on the underground on the  way to the office and it syncs as soon as I'm above ground.",
It's annoying that you have to pay an outrageous amount ($30 a year) for it to do anything more than a simple checklist. For example it won't do notifications or recurring tasks.,
"I think the options to view your tasks according to priority has been moved to the subscription service because the error ""filter bot found"" regularly pops up",
Seems to have a lot of great functions for a free app. I can set due dates and work on just that day's list. I had a master list in another app and it was overwhelming.,
"I've used a lot of productivity apps, and this is one that I really like.  It's simple to use and I like the multi platform use.   The reminders are useful.   I'm still learning, so I'm not sure if I can link it to mapping apps to get reminders to leave for appointments based on traffic,  but will explore more.",
"Simple, clean & powerful task management. A little lacking if you don't go premium, but premium is well worth it.",
"Every sensible option is locked behid the paywall. Free version of the app feels barren, clunky and unintuitive.",
"This app has made me a more productive, organised efficient individual. Almost exhausting what I can get done with it.",
"I like it really much, though I think that it is missing some features. For example being able to add a task that should be done before some date.",
"I want alert for my tasks, like say half n hr before the task or 1 hour. I don't know how I could do that. Rest otherwise. It's good",
Nice app didn't know you had to make a purchase for complete access guess I'll wait and see how useful it is before purchasing the full access,
The program is a new reminder of tasks for which I have set a completion date. I wish it was a bit more flexible in the way tasks are added.,
Enough options to organize multi-layers of multi-projects w/ multi-people but not so many bells &  whistles that it's cumbersome to use.,
This has helped me keep on top of things I an thinking of upgrading to the premium service but will keep going with this version for a little while yet.,
"I'm able to keep track of all the things I need to get done, organise them well even without premium, and collaborate with my fiancé on our shared responsibilities. It's wonderful!",
"Todoist is the best tool to take you from handwritten scribbles around your apartment to well-organized personal task management! I love their connection with their customers, too.",
Got the free version.  Difficult to organize tasks.  Then they locked my info and wanted me to pay $30 for a years use.,
For me the killer features are a genuinely intuitive interface and the easy management of subtasks.,
"Easy to use.  Windows 10 app lags behind Android app in functionality, but am very happy in general.  Has helped me and my company track, share, and complete lists of todos.",
"Just started using it about a week ago. No complaints, looks beautiful and simple to use. Will update as I get into more of the features",
"The best task manager I've tried so far. Going to the second year in premium and lovin' it.  Missing a calendar view, although.  Edit to update: great, once added I'll probably rate 5 star.",
The home page option should be customized to  show 4 to 5 project at a time (my suggestion),
I like the Inbox feature where you can just dump all your to do's so as not to miss anything.,
This is a great app. It is easy to use and has everything I need for daily and weekly tasks. I don't use all its functions but the other sections don't get in the way of what I need which other app providers could take note of.,
"In conjuction with GTD methodology, I have finally gotten ahold of my life! I suggest reading ""Getting Things Done"" and implementing this app within that methodology.",
Great note taking app with a great design that doesn't get in my way when im working. They also have a really good chrome extension that works well with the app.,
I use it daily to stay on top of both important and mundane tasks.  Especially like the recurring features,
I wish Google Keep did the same thing.  I use it just to make simple to do lists.  It looks like it does a ton more...,
Reminder feature is the main feature of this type of app which is not available in free version otherwise everything is perfect. Gui is awesome.,
"Good app. A bit tricky at first, if you come from MS Outlook, for example. But once you get used to how it works, and how to program new todo's and reminders, it's very good.   For me, however, it lacks very important features. For example, let's imagine that ten notification reminders pop up in your cell phone at 8:00 a.m. For some reason, you have to restart your phone (e.g., it falls down and the battery slips off.) When you do so, your notifications are gone---and if they were a lot, you just won't remember which they were. Or, for example, let's imagine one notification pops up, and you take a look at the comment attached to it. After that, if you move to any other app or just return to home screen in your phone, notification is gone, even though you have not completed that todo.   There is no way to take a look at which todo's have notifications programmed for today (you can only see which todo's due dates are set for today.) Also it would be nice to have a way to take an easy look to a calendar when programming a reminder---currently you can only take a glimpse at a calendar when setting the due date.",
I do not want to sign up. App thinks I must.  Deleted immediately.,
"Beautiful and simple design.  No distractions, quick and easy sync.  On another level I spotless love to see adding pictures and assigning tasks to persons",
Easy to use for simple tasks management. It would be better if there was reminder alert feature in the free version.,
"Not used premium, but find it intuitive & useful tool for organising and scheduling to do lists. Using post it notes a lot less!",
"Near perfect. Needs next actions, simpler sub tasks and native Evernote integrations. Good Workarounds possible.",
"It's an adventure figuring out how to add repeating tasks, but RD keeps me in line fulfilling my obligations.",
"Very useful. Has most features you need. The pro version feels a little bit more expensive than I like, so I'm sticking with the basic.",
I think it's a very handy app to keep a list of everything you need to get done. Very easy to use; and has never posed a problem for me.,
Very handy app. I like that I can use it on mobile and desktop and it syncs perfectly. It has significantly improved my daily productivity.,
Best productivity app ever. Im using to set my kids chores. Just setup recurring tasks and they get notified on their phones automatically. Sweet no nagging from dad!,
I really like Todoist because it helps me to be more productive. Having it on both my phone and as a Chrome plugin is the best part because I can add something to my list whenever I need it. The text parser for times to do tasks at is also very cool and useful. Great UX and UI and it does everything it's supposed to,
"Helps me keep track of busy college life while separating different projects such as my car, shopping lists and more. Very useful app.",
"I got the premium in a bundle, i would normally just use Google keep to stay on track of things. So far it seems effective.",
"Um ótimo aplicativo, com design claro e intuitivo, recomendo para todos meus amigos. Para melhorar só faltou a visualização das atividades por um calendário.",
"Allows me to keep track of multiple things in personal life from must do's to ideas of things to do. Shared ""projects"" with significant other keep us on the same page when needed!",
Clean and intuitive interface makes this app very easy to use.  Despite this simplicity it's amazingly fully featured  and takes care of everything I (and most users) could need in a project management / to do list application. Syncing across devices is almost instantaneous making it a doddle to move quickly from pc to mobile whenever the need arises.,
I'm giving this 2 stars for now since I'm in the learning phase. Not sure of its full capabilities since I only have the free version. Will rate higher if I like and get the full version.,
"Am extremely selective in choosin planning and scheduling tools. Must say this is one of the best. Two years now, trird the premium and the free. Both amazing. Well done.",
"Nice interface, very intuitive, but the free version it's very limited. Overall, it's a good app to track your tasks and lists. Sadly, in the free mode, you can't link it to your calendar, therefore, I give it 3 stars.",
Awesome that lists can be shared and I love being able to create lists within list items so easily.,
Super simple to use and fast to add new tasks. Great keyboard shortcuts on the web app too.,
I love how easy it is to setup recurring tasks plus plan out long-range projects. Love!,
"The paid version is outstanding.  The free app cuts out too many features. Sync is good and Alexa integration is fantastic.  If you are looking for free,  look at Wunderlist instead.   But if you are willing to pay,  Todoist is great.",
Simple task-tracking app. Would love it if you could see beyond 7 days,
"Brilliant App to help organise my tasks. There are some good you tube video to help get the best from it. I use Carl Pullein working with todist, only because I know him but there are others.",
"I was looking for a product to help me organize my busy life in retirement.  I have many projects going on at any given time, and Todoist really helps me stay organized and focused.",
"Been using this app for almost a year with the premium, and I have already subscribed for the next. Best todo list app I've ever come across.",
I am a terrible list maker but this has really helped me be more organized.  I highly recommend for anyone who is not inately organized.,
It works well on any platform and gives me great reminders. I  recommend this tool to anyone looking for a modern tool.,
Very useful app and premium version gives more use cases and very simple interfaces. My tasks getting done now.,
It was great before last update. Currently I cannot work cause it crashes every time I put a task with date.,
"I use more the desktop version, but the mobile experience is really easy to use and helpful when I'm not in front of my laptop.",
"This app fit my needs almost perfectly, I just wish it was a one off purchase for the premium version instead of a subscription model. If it was so, I would buy it without hesitation.",
Keeps me right on track to get things done. I was blessed  with a stroke 9 months ago so if i dont gave it in writing I dont get it done,
Helps me stay productive and give positive feedback and a good feeling when you get to check a task off the list. The widget is nice because you don't need to open the full app to check on the day or mark something as done. Would recommend to all those list makers out there.,
I use this for everything every day. It is also great if you're collaborating with another person. My fiancée and I get a lot done during the week because of this.,
"Todoist is a brilliant app, however i would have loved it to have a few more elements which could make it excellent. Such as a vision board for entire goals, and a weekly view of all my engagement for the coming week. All the same its an extremely useful app and i use it everyday.",
"I can track my daily activities.  Although other things are paid, I will eventually get the paid service.",
Even the free version is useful I can keep track of everything make repeatable daily routines make one time lists for short-term projects,
Really good app for organising what I need to do for school. Would recommend to anyone who struggles to keep up with tasks.,
"Love the app and it's sync abilities. Would be nice if there were the option of time durations for tasks, so that you could calculate your avaliable daily schedule. Also, the ability to start a timer for the assigned duration for motivational assistance if desired.",
Would like to suggest some feature improvements such as goal mapping and better project management. Still much better overall than the rest of the tools out there.,
Very confusing and weirdly set up. Almost impossible to edit your events and times.,
"Clean UI, lots of features, you just have any excuses for not doing work.",
"I was able to dive right in and thouroughly fill my board out with tasks from the various methods I previously used. The widespread integrations allowed me to sync my to-dos with Alexa and Pebble pretty easily. My only concern at this time is that it can be somewhat hard to visualize larger projects, but perhaps features of paid accounts address this.",
Stuck with it for over 2 years now which is a testament to how easy it is to use. Best one yet.,
"Aould like a feature to write quick notes without a deadline being needed, but does what it says on the tin. The daily reminders are a great help!",
"I could previously sort project detials by date, but now I cannot even touch the sort button - it opens too quickly. Please fix it.",
"Perfect for my needs and cross platform from my phone to PC.  Lots of ways to use it. If you are looking for a to do list, reminder or calendar Todoist will do it.  It also integrates with some other Apps.",
"Still early days but I really like this app, connects with my Alexa dot, I'm able to make lists, be reminded of items I need to remember! Staying organised, hopefully this will continue to help me as I do forget important items to early dementia!",
"I use this app across 3 platforms and am very impressed with it. It's simple to use, it has a wide array of tips available and when I had a support question, they were very fast to reply.",
"Great app, runs smoothly. Best feature so far is the quick add with quick deadlines and reschedule. Improved productivity immediately. Nightly recommend.",
Quick and easy to add tasks. I love the karma points. They usually tell me how I've been doing and this way I can keep tracking my progress.,
"Especially for a free app, impressed by all its features. I can use it to organize basically everything in my life.",
Nothing to say a great app... the premium especially makes you use it more actively.,
"This thing is really well laid out, and is greatly helping me increase my work efficiency",
I tried a few to-do apps and none of them quite made it for me. Todoist has the right mix between effectiveness and good design to make itself easily into quite an addictive habit.,
After tryin so many others so called famous apps i chose this and i even upgraded  to premium. But guys? Ur windows 10 app is not workin at all! I mean these issues shudnt come up widin premium version right? Or not even in basic one. Whateever i write elsewhere works fine. But windows 10 app inputs just dont get synced. I just found out about it after i already added 20 tasks and i dnt rmmbr wat dey were now! As dey r encrypted.  And please add a lock or passlock to stop otherz from openin dis awesome online diary of ours. Just get synced thing done. Rest evrythn is fine except these 2 issues. Please plesse sort dis out win10 app version of urs is best and dis bug is irritating!,
"Wonderful. Easy to use,  accessible from anywhere and anything. Very comprehensive free version,  with reasonably priced upgrade which adds useful extras.",
"Simple, easy to use, all the other good things people have been saying. It really helps me, as a teacher, get all my tasks organized in one place!",
"This has been a good app for me, but I am looking for more than even the paid version even does. For instance, I would love to see next step tracking.",
"Just a good, cross platform and cloud based to do list including folder support for project based lists.",
I like that it syncs with all devices. Reschedule option is great and it recognises the time and day. Don't like that you cant see what you have done though.,
For busy people this is the ideal app for task management. Different folders and labels (premium) provide context for your work which improves efficiency!,
Free version is too basic.  Wish you would show the cost and premium features from the start so I don't waste my time.,
"I've used a few to-do list services, but Todoist is simply the best.  The interface is simple, intuitive, and works well.  My only gripe is that the Windows 10 app doesn't work as well as the Android.  Otherwise, well done!",
"There are more powerful task managers out there, but of all the ones I've tried Todoist gives me the most benefit for the least effort.   Kudos for the ""Add task"" quick-toggle button. It's great.",
"It's usable, Great interface, on the fly usage, and most importantly non intrusive way of keeping tab on to do list.",
"I have this app on my phone and computer. It keeps me on track with daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. Giving me a more structured workflow. I've only been using it for 2 weeks, but so far so good.",
Fantastic app I can depend on to keep from getting overwhelmed with life.,
It's really helping me to stay organized in 2017 emailing me the task that that I haven't completed,
"Helpful/nice interface...wish there was a way to attach shopping list...wish it was more tightly integrated with Google calendar, but overall",
I am not exactly sure why but this app has had a greater effect on my productivity than other apps. I really love it!,
"So far so good. I've been using for a short period of time, but this app has been fulfilling my needs to stay organised.",
Decided to install app after I read the book Do More Better by Tim Challies. Along with a few other apps he suggests in his book. Todoist has helped keep me productive in a red herring world. :),
Works great with Alexa. I paid to get timed / repeating ToDos and they work great with Alexa too!,
Great app. Great integration. Notification emails and daily digest is annoying. Can't find out how to stop it.,
The swiping is so natural. Right now the less intuitive element is any longer term planning. It's an extra step to add an item and then move it forward in time.,
"Great for keeping organised list of tasks. I move them into my calender as needed, then tick them off. Love that I have access from all devices.",
Todoist does an amazing job of helping me stay organized without being heavy handed about it. Encouraging and helpful... love it!,
"Great for planning and outlining tasks, could use a better reminder/ notification function. Would prefer the home screen to display  upcoming events/ tasks rather than just stating that you're done for the day.",
The simplistic layout  sold me. I much prefer that over wunderlist,
"Excellent for coordination tool for families:  To do lists for all family members and wishlists, Santa's list, Grocery and shopping lists, project items, etc.  grocery list items are stored so as you check them completed this time you can bring back for future lists",
"Great app! Easy to use, intuitive, and most importantly effective. Mobile and web integration work great. Updating past due tasks is logical and quick. Managing large task lists is very manageable. Highly recommend.",
"It's has been revolutionary for me, it's well worth £21 per year. We are now looking at it business wide.",
Helps me keep track of what I need to do and also what I'd like to do (small daily/weekly goals). Set it and forget it. Great interface!,
"I have been using todoist for years. I have a premium account for work but use a free version at home. I am super disappointed that the ""filters"" tools have been restricted to premium users. Otherwise would rank this app five stars.",
Can't set repeating tasks.... life is repeating every day missed the mark on this one,
Very helpful and friendly use. One of most positive side is you can drill down your activities as projects and then to task. What it needs is to develop a way to import reports of completed tasks for example to excel or word for reporting purposes,
Todoist is basically what keeps me on-schedule. The app is great and is an essential part of the system.,
"Would be nice if I could make recurring bundles of tasks to save and quickly add in as needed, otherwise it is the best free to do app I've found!",
"Most used app on my phone. If Todoist gets down I will get down, too. I organise everything by it.",
"I only have free version, but would be nice to create recurring tasks so i don t need to enter daily tasks that i still need reminders for.",
I've tried quite a few solutions to manage my to-do list. This is definitely the best one!,
Not a good app for writing quick and simple lists.,
I'll test it and update my results.  I have a good feeling that it might just be 5 stars! I highly recommended this essential tool!,
"Out of a handful of apps, I choose Todoist, just for the swiping pleasure.",
"Simple UI, clean use cases, functional and effective in organizing stuff and 'Getting Things Done'",
"This app has definitely helped increase productivity, but it would be nice to re-organize certain folders & be able to add more hierarchy type settings. Maybe even add labels with colors to help define more important tasks?",
Great user interface. Easy to use. Always making improvements ements. Helps me capture everything and keeps my head clear.,
"Some parts are a little cumbersome, especially switching between inbox and a project.",
"With our cell phones and laptops becoming our appendages,  todoist is a great tool to keep everyone on the same page on a project and move it equally fast",
Very nice app especially the reminders which do not allow you to forget your tasks.,
"Love  this app, easy to use on any device and let's me organise my day/week/month easily.  Very useful. Thanks",
Main reason for downloading was it works with the Amazon Echo. It's a good simple to use organiser - keeps my shopping list in order!,
Great way of keeping tasks organised - with reminders - all in one place.,
"I use this app to help me keep track on some day to day tasks I need to complete, really helped me with my laziness to hsve the app remind me to get out and excercise every other day",
List should not need any personal information or access to account information.,
I use this for everything now :) even moreso than google calender,
Great app with the features I have been wishing for.  Wish I had found it sooner.,
"I've been using this app to manage my projects,  and it's proven very useful",
"This is one of the best apps ever made. If you looking for sth to organise your life and your daily tasks, you have to check this out!",
Capture your tasks without stress. Todoist is easy to use very quick to input and manage tasks. Multiple views to suit your style.,
Does what I need it to do. Simple interface that hides a lot of powerful features. Useful integration with android wear,
"I've tried a few different to do list apps and organizational systems, Todoist is definitely my favorite. Easy to use and fun to earn those Karma points!",
It's easy to use and is very user-friendly. A great app to keep me organized.,
A very useful app. Keep reminding you unfinished list until you finish it.,
"Easy to use, great look. Would be an unorganized mess without it!",
First ToDo to actually help me complete my tasks. Loving the scheduling options.,
I like the Chrome extension and how easy it is to add the date when you need to do something by just writing the word instead of having to choose the date on a calendar,
Helps me to remember all of the important things that sometimes get forgotten in life. Easy to use and works just as advertized,
I have always used lists.  This is so easy to use and great way to stay organized.,
Love the karma feature! Keeps me productive and prevents being lazy!,
"I need to login just to see my list? That's crazy. I might as well just login to my email / calendar. Yes, one star because I went to add an item but it wouldn't let me! I have over a dozen apps on my phone, do you really expect me to log into each one AND use strong passwords?",
Do NOT Buy. Thus app is for brainless suckers! It is a huge waste of money!!! It is 20-25 times more expensive than the app's utility is worth!,
Very good system overall.  App is feature-complete and uses latest style design for Android.,
I use todoust every day. At work and home. On mobile and Chrome. Very easy and awesome to use it. Thanks.,
"This app is great, i had all my employees download it. Our productio  has definately increased because of this.",
I've been reminded of my projects and goals and become more productive as a result.  Woohoo!,
Multiple platform support makes this my number 1 preference for a ToDo list. 😉,
Really helps me keep on top of my never ending to do lists. Intuitive layout and navigation.,
"Its a great app!! Ever since I download this I've become more productive. It's useful when you're head is at the 9th cloud, with this you can remember what you had to do.",
Great to do app but I would love it if had a section where it showed all my completed tasks.,
Works well. The time parsing is even more intuitive than I would have imagined.,
"Have to get the premium version subscription to get most benefit, but it's worth the small price.",
This is an awesome app...  It contains really good tools which makes the app easy to use...  The app is really well organised.,
The project lists are great. I can use my memory for more important things!,
I now can easily arrange my tasks in a convenient way. Thanks!,
Great. I love how you get reminders. It reminds me of what's overdue. Perfect app,
Now I just need some time management help! But I love the ease and the auto save. Great app!,
Application makes it really easy to add and update tasks.,
Is there a way to see what youve done throughout the whole day? Rather than it just disappearing. I would like to see what ive done that day but it to go away for me the next day.,
"Best app ever used. Very useful, helps me to manage daily work.",
Good In premium. Other wise it is not good.,
"This app is very good, but has a steep learning curve, or rather, needs to be moire intuitive. Needs tutorials.",
"App is great, but reminder pop-up doesn't work for me. And I'm a premium user.",
Haven't upgraded to premium but this is my fave list maker to date,
I tried a few organization app and this app hit home run with me,
I love this app! As someone who loves to make lists this is perfect. I find I'm actually getting more done then I have been with regular paper to do lists. Highly recommended!!!,
Found it really helpful as a way to keep on top of everything!,
"Love it, trying to link with echo dot can be unreliable though.",
Good app that you can refer back to constantly that also pushes  you updated.  Like this quite a bit.,
I personally have this connected with the Todoist Google extension and it's just simply brilliant!..,
UI is very similar to gmail. Its easy to use and the animations are also good!!,
It definitely can help you to be more productive. I RECOMAND IT!,
So easy to stay organized and on track with life's to do things,
I even had time to write this review,
Todist is a great tool that has helped me to organize my day better!,
Light and Good UI. Compatible for my Mac and also Androids . Good luck todoist.,
"I have tried many todo list apps, this by far is the best!",
Has helped me stay on task and has made me aware of how much I get distracted from my daily goals!,
Finally a list I don't lose,
When i scroll down the list ;it instantly moves up,
Best task management tool I've found. The integration with Gmail is a huge bonus.,
I'm very happy to see all of the improvements made in the last year two!,
"Integrations, sharing, working towards easier and easier ways to add tasks it's amazing",
I use the app everyday and it keeps me organized.,
reminers are only in the pro version,
App is good. But doesn't show history of completed tasks,
Great app. Makes Checking off your list easy to do. Reminders are awesome. Highly suggest!!,
It helps me be a more productive. I love it! I really really really love it! The wedding is in March.,
Theme consistent with Google apps. Very stable app and easy to use!,
"earlier it was bad,  now everything works perfect so giving 5",
I really enjoy this app. Makes it easier to organise my busy life!,
I'm a homeschooling mom of five... So far I feel like I can finally get some brain space back by putting all my details into this. I think this just might WORK for ME!!!!,
"I like that this app can sync in phone and chrome extension. I use it for both personal and work. It helps me to plan my work the night before and put my phone aside while at work and open popout window todoist in chrome extension. It has pretty interface and log in task is very easy with shortcut for date and project. I have downloaded several apps for to do list and this is the most convenient,  simple and 'clean' for me by far. I hope todoist can be linked with the standard phone calendar.. because for future log like meetings and outstation, project due.. it is easier to manage them with monthly preview. So far..the best app managing your to-do and plan your days. Big hand for the app developer!",
Great little digital to-do-list and reminder. Came recommended by Tim Challis' Ligonier course 'Do more better'.,

"The interface of app is very good, love it.",
Great app but I wish you could chose which day to set a task for on the weekly time frame,
It is one of the best task manager app but my only complaint is its most of the features are premium,
So far it has been great. I love that it syncs with my Alexa Echo.,
The more you use it the more you like it upgrade for the price it's a bargin,
Would like it to be a little more handy for sub tasks.,
Easy to use and works across multiple platforms.,
Simply the best task manager I've found after years of searching the competition.,
Great App productivity & time management has improved greatly.,
"No reminders, seriously? That's the minimal any free app should provide. Just flaunting with brilliant UI is a bad developers code of conduct.",
Exactly what I was looking for in an app. Especially the simplicity of connecting through email on multiple devices.,
A simple function like remind with alarm doesn't work properly,
"Works great on my Android phone, iPad, and desktop. Keeps me organized!",
"Nothing fancy, keeps track of things for me",
Works great and has the best widget I've seen for a to do list app,

I have comments on tasks on the web that are not appearing on the Android app,
"Once I started using todoist, it became the way for me to establish habits.",
Permanently hides your completed tasks from you in the free version.,
This app makes creating a todo list quick and easy.,
Instead of having the option to click on premium features just take it out please so only the premium people can see it,
Truly helps me prioritise my day. Brill,
Rock solid app - elegantly simple system. Liking this more than I expected I would!,
It helps me get things done much quicker.,

"Sometimes it just doesn't sync across platforms. And if it does, the tasks are inconsistent (as they're marked as done on one platform and still not done on another). But maybe it's just the Mac app (which is a web app) and not the Android one...",
To-do list is a life saver for me!,

Todo list,
Desde que estoy usando esta aplicación me he organizado. Cada vez que completo una tarea siento un logro y lo mejor es cerrar el día con el deber cumplido. La recomiendo!!!!!😎,
"Ciao! Bella app... Sarebbe utile avere la opzione di vedere quando ho fatto qualche attività, fare in modo che sia possibile consultare la attività svolta in giorni precedenti. :')",
Tops.,
ใช้ได้ดี มีวิธีจัดข้อมูลหลายแบบ ทำให้จัดลำดับและกลุ่มงานได้สะดวก เสียแต่ต้องเสียค่าใช้จ่ายเป็นรายเดือน หรือรายปี ถ้างานมีข้อมูลรายละเอียดมาก ก็น่าใช้,
Later,
Yeah,
Ol,
Works like a charm,
Deceptively simple and surprisingly elegant. It is present in almost any environment which let's me feel my tasks are always at hand.,
Great app to remind you to do things or to track your goals :),
Never forget another task/chore again!,
I work 7 days a week! Please add an option to include weekends in Smart Schedule!,
Very good. I enjoy it,
One of the best to do lists,
Simple and intuitive,
Best tool,
Love it,
"I originally wrote a review for this program a year or so ago and lamented the need to pay a subscription to be able to set alarms. That was before I understood the ubiquitous and wonderful nature of Todoist. I now have Todoist on my phone, tablet, Outlook, and both home and work PCs. It syncs perfectly amongst all locations and really keeps me on an even keel. I've even become a fan of karma points. This is a great program for implementing GTD.",
"Although it still has its issues, todoist is constantly improving, adding features and getting better. It is cross-platform, although sometimes the  differences between the different versions can be annoying. I wish it had import-export capabilities. I don't think the integration with Outlook is very good. Still using the program after a year and I sometimes marvel at its simple elegance.",
I can easily add new items to my to-do list by using the short cut widget. The interface is clean and simple. I like how I can see the things I need to do in a week. The app automatically finds the key words in your writing to figure out when it is due. That is probably the coolest part. It really helps me remember to do important things. The karma points motivate me to complete my to do lists.,
I'm enjoying the free version so far.  Only drawback is not having the option to set a reminder for a time sensitive task BEFORE the task is due to be completed.  But so far I'm satisfied enough to consider upgrading but ONLY if that option is made available even in the free version.  Cuz even the free calendar that comes with my phone allows me to set multiple reminders.  So it's kind of lame that I can't do that here.,
This app is exactly what I have needed for a while now. No more lists that get lost in my purse! It's nicely organized and easy to use. I only gave it a 4 because there are many wonderful features that cost much more than necessary. I just won't pay that much for an app. Happy with the app but disappointed with the cost of half of the features.,
"Very good, though not perfect. Both Windows and Android apps have rather slow workflow. For example Windows app show sliding animations of all menus and use fonts for tablet, not desktop. On both systems, the board switching is also slow using the left side menu only. There are other issues as well. The app shows a lot of promise, but just isn't the fast todo app I need.",
"Only been using Todoist for about a week, but this is one of the best organization apps I've run across, and I'm a bit of a junkie. Interface is clean, simple, and easy to use. The ability to sub-categorize and the ease of sharing lists with anyone you like put it way ahead of others. First high-tech solution that beats pen and paper for me. Need to fix occasional stuck loading screen. Still some issues with making recurring tasks (recognizing ""every other day"" etc.), but more intuitive than expected.",
"Not only good user interface, but also excellent Karma system. It make the task management fun, where I used to think task management is boring. This app certainly helps me to imorove my productivity.",
"Been using this app for a week and it's great. We have rental properties so I can make materials list , what to check at the courthouse: etc.  Having trouble with fractions such as sizes for plywood.  App changes it to dates.",
"There should be a feature of adding levels of completeness of the tasks. If I began a task today and went halfway through, I want to mark that on my to-do list, or else I end up feeling like I did nothing the whole day.",
"An excellent free app. It does just what I want without complicated bells and whistles. I'm sure the paid version has more options, but all I needed was a simple to do list. I like that you can postpone or reschedule tasks that you didn't get to that day.",
I downloaded this app after our lights got cut off because I wasn't receiving the bills and forgot to pay! I have many recurring reminder tasks from bills to cleaning and even for continuing education. This app is fantastic and helps me keep track of all the things I need to do in a user-friendly way!,
"Most to-do lists are either unintuitive or bloated with features. Todoist gets out of the way so you can focus just on your tasks instead! Some features need a subscription though, like commenting on tasks, setting reminders, and collaborating with others.",
"Best to-do list app I've used our of many. Clean design that is easy to navigate. I linked Chrome and Outlook to it and all works smoothly. No ads on the free version, however the premium version is well worth it.",
Easy to use interface keeps tasks organized and lets me manage them and make changes quickly. No more long backlog because the timing of one tasks makes everything fall behind. Sub-tasks are very useful too.,
"Todoist caters to how my mind works. It enables me to spit out all of the things that run through my mind. At the end of the day, I take a look at the action items, organize and keep up with the momentum. It would be nice to have a zappier with expensify. Though, I jerry rigged the comments so that I can email my receipts in much like how the trello cards work. Also, I would love to still view what I've assigned to folks. I think that it gets archived on my end, perhaps? Keep it up, thanks!",
"I paid for premium, now I'm wasting my time figuring out why my premium is gone. Send him a service request but why am I wasting my time with an app that supposed to save me time. Even if they fix this I will leave it a one-star review because I'm wasting my time with an app that supposed to save me time get it yet? Get this s*** fixed",
"This app has turned our home into a well oiled machine with all parts functioning in unison towards the same objectives. We are just so much more efficient now, and communication is in real time. Couldn't live without it.",
"Being able to use English syntax in almost any format to input tasks is awesome. It makes it easy to schedule things when I think about them, no matter the context in which the thought occurs.  It's really neat.",
"This app really helps me organise and motivate myself, and remember those little things I'd otherwise forget! It's super easy to add tasks, customise categories, etc. to make it work for you, and the karma feature definitely helps motivate me to get as much done each day as possible. :P Thanks!!",
"Really simple and easy to use, but at the same time it's also really powerful and effective. I use Todoist for personal chores, grocery & shipping lists, keeping track of bills, and it's even made it's way into my work life via the Outlook plug-in. Quite simply, as soon as I started using it, Todoist quickly became an integral part of my daily life by helping me manage all of the ""stuff"" that can be overlooked so easily.",
"I've used about four other applications in the past year to manage my workload and my teams, and none are as simple, as good looking or as cheap as todoist. Wouldn't go back to anything else now.",
"Used many different apps. Each had something or the other missing. But this has everything I was looking for, simple to use and has been keeping me busy with work. Never realised I have so much stuff to do",
"This was the only app where I could find nesting to-dos, but it's a little complicated to use. More i just treat it like a running to-do list",
"Installed this app and played with it for a solid 2 hours and compared it to a few other similar apps. It seems decent, however I could not nest or create sub-tasks. Maybe this feature is in the paid version. But surely, even a basic alarm sound feature to notify should be available with the free version of the app! If I can not hear or get pop-up notifications for my due tasks, then I see little point using this app. Will unfortunately not be keeping this app.",
"Todoist is the tool I've been looking for.  It makes it virtually impossible to NOT know what I need to do next, today and next week. It's SO easy to use.",
"For me the deciding factor in keeping a to-do app is whether or not it becomes its own chore due to poor design. Tidoist excels in all categories - adding items, scheduling and organizing them, and completing them. It's a joy to use!",
"The App is just awesome. There are hundrets of possibilities that help you organize yourself. 4 Stars because you can't really use the app sensible without buying premium. But 28,99€ per year are definitely worth what you get for it!",
Has all the functionality you need. The interface could be a little more intuitive - think Windows vs a Mac,
"this app does what you need, such as letting you put a specific meeting with a time in the description and it automatically synces with your list and notifications to help remind you. App is useful and needed for all planners.",
"The only thing that I want from them is to add a monthly or half a year subscripition, not just a yearly one.",
"Lacklustre offerings for a premium price. I would have bought in for a one time price, but no way am I being billed regularly for a digital planner.",
"This app is great for scheduling tasks and things that need doing. The only suggestion I have is to add a way to have tasks that don't have a dated deadline, just a simple to-do list for when one has chance to get to them",
"I was looking for an easy to use task tracking app, and this one is great. I really like the feature that allows me to set a task to be due in the future.",
"As a full-time college student this has been my number one organization tool. It would be much more difficult to stay on top of classes without this app. It is reliable and easy to use, so good job developers!",
"I like it, but I don't like finding out what I can only do in the free version by selecting an option presented to me only to find its only available in the premium version.  I realize that this is an effective tool, but it is no less irritating.",
"Love the natural language input, accessibility across platforms and integration to other services via IFTTT. Cannot function (well) without Todoist. A happy premium customer for years.",
"The widget I use keeps going back to let me choose a view a while after choosing one, hope you guys can fix it.",
Awesome app..  Minimal and useful together.. Just wish there was an offline version available for Windows.. The Windows7 app is not as good as the chrome app.  Still that wud be nitpicking..  5 stars from my side,
I use this app all the time because it is so easy to add a task with other associated info,
I love love love this app.  I don't know what I did before I got it.  I can finally keep up with my very busy life and not fall behind.  There are not words to describe not much this app rocks.,
"Simple, effective way to keep tabs in an organized manner, collaboratively. Email notifications make sure you don't forget, and maintains its effectiveness by refusing to collect dust with all the novelties downloaded in the moment.",
This is a very helpful app. I've only had a few days but I like it better than Trello.,
"constantly delightful and improving. my entire life is now wrapped up in todoist, and I can't imagine how I'd organize my life without it. Pro is totally worth it.",
"What's the use of a to do list which claims it's free but has reminders in the premium one only. And the premium is for ₹1800. Whopping rip off!!! Use wunderlist instead. This app has great organisation better than the others and a great Mac app, but reminders have to be a part of free!!!",
"Good service and app.  I like it enough to have paid for it, but there are a few things that I would like to see done differently. For example, there is no ""start date"", just a due date. I don't like to do things the day they are due.",
I don't usually rate apps but when I do it's because they either suck majorly or rule royally. 5 stars because I can't give 6. 👊,
For me it's an extremely helpful app as I work and always have a lot of things to do and it seems impossible to have time for everything. Thank you so much,
"After trying just about every task management service, I settled on Todoist. One of the things I wanted was to be able to view all tasks across all users and all projects, none of the others seemed to have this.",
"The best for universal compatibility, ease of use and features. Even has a plugin you can install into Outlook.",
"Thus far, I am enjoying use of Todoist.  It has yet to crash on me. The reminder notice is helpful. Thanks",
Update : the app is dead.  White screen loading.     Slick app. Good work!  P.S. In your latest update you lost the icon and now it's generic android one,
This is a very simple-looking app but the functionality is incredible. Especially now that they've added auto-rescheduling of overdue tasks. It's everything you want!,
"Everything is going to plan, thanks to Todoist. Only one thing missing - the ability to easily set tasks aside for smaller periods of time like 10 minutes, or an hour or two.",
I've been using it for years and love it. All the features needed to implement GTD are there. Simple and efficient.,
It's great having a todo list that's synchronized on all my devices. Being able to group tasks into projects is nice.,
"Todoist is an easy to use, simple, and elegant app no time manager should go without.",
I would like to see a little better integration with outlook. This really helps me keep track of everything,
Loving this app so far. Seems better than other todo apps that I've used in the past. Has great features around helping you manage your tasks better,
Iuved it thoroughly... Enjoying the timely reminders. I need the app to put up a facility where everyday chores can be reminded viz.  medicines,
Very slow in showing the updated tasks. I had to wait for 10-15 min just to see what are in my to do list. Pathetic experience.,
only installed this as Amazon Alexa doesnt support keep. If you can make it easy to drag items up and down and  have a simple tick box to complete items then you would be wortg a 5,
I don't know where I'd be without Todoist. As a student I've used it to organize my life weeks in advance and understand what needs to be done by when. Sync between PC and Mobile is incredibly useful too. Couldn't recommend it more.,
"I've stuck with Todoist for longer than any other system I've used in the past. It's available on every platform I need and provides a good balance between speed, simplicity and flexibility. Recommended.",
"After the last updates when creating a new note on the phone, pressing the enter button closes the note instead of starting a new line in the same note. I hate it. Please give at least the option to revert it back",
"Focused, clean, doesn't attempt to do everything and this is superior to anything more featured.",
I am using it for the first time.  What's different from other programs to note task is that it graph measures your productivity and motivates you to get better,
"The deal breaker for me with the other apps is lack of outlook integration. This has it and the convenience of being able to categorize and organize the task as you type it, which is great. This app keeps me organized and on schedule. I wish the reminders were free but, i guess they got to make money some how.",
"I really love the app. I think the model of date/time notifications being paid for is not right. Wish it wasn't so, happy with app though.",
"Does what it says on the tin and is easy to use and the free one is more than enough. However I did like the humour in the carrot iOS app, it made me use it more.",
Please make it possible to customize your home screen so that it displays all your projects right at the start when you launch the app. It would make adding tasks so much easier. I'll happily give 5 stars if you add that feature!,
"Still. The lack of weekly view and monthly view is a serious contra-productive matter. Weekly view and monthly view currently not presented as table, and I hate it seeing a list. Those lazy programmers never learns. I bought another app.",
Love this app! I don't like paying subscriptions but the premium version is worth every penny. Highly recommended,
"To me, if an app is any good, it should be to some degree intuitive. I am a reasonably intelligent person but I cannot find how to delete a task. When I find that out rating may go up.",
I find it works great if you use it in conjunction with the website on a computer.,
Would give 5 stars if one could do frequent actions using swipe actions..For instance postponing the backlog sholdn't take 3 taps..,
"If you like the GTD method, you'll love this app.  Experiment with the project names and subcategories until you have what you want.   Google Todoist to learn about different set-up options.",
"It has everything you need for your to do list. The only thing I would like to make it better -  if it would send reminders to your phone, if a deadline was nearing.",
Overall I like the app. I only use the free version right now but it does everything you would expect a to do list to do.,
Requires you to purchase it to use reminders. And the cost is ridiculous.  It's a freaking task checklist.,
"Leaves a bit too many features for pro users only, but everyone's gotta make money I guess. No ads and no bugs.",
I like the ability to make projects and set due dates for various tasks in the project. Very easy to use. It's very comvenient to have this on my phone and laptop.,
"This is the one I always come back to! Super simple, intuitive, and cross platform! Highly recommended to anyone",
"Since I use ToDoist in my daily work, my productivity has exploded.",
Simple and confused at the same time. It's not the same procedure in different devices. Need equalizer UI for all devices. But works well.,
"I love how user friendly the interface is and how I can sync across all of my devices. This app is a great, no frills way to make sure all my tasks and deadlines are with me wherever I go and no matter what device I'm using. I never review, but here I am. Use it.",
"Todoist has helped me get organized, which is quite the accomplishment. Great product and a wonderful support team behind it.",
It is a good way of organizing your plans. I personally use it for school assignments and it works great. Only wish some more features were unlocked without having to pay for the premium.,
I've tried a lot of similar apps and this one easily out performs the rest. With IFTTT and Alexa integration it is the perfect productivity tool.,
"We are using Todoist in all functions of our business. As a CRM for our sales and marketing team, in the purchasing department for tracking orders and purchases, in the production  department for scheduling and tracking our factory and in the accounting department for ensuring timely payments and collections.",
"I spent some time to understand the basics.  I watched a few YouTube videos and suddenly I become more productive with less effort.  Pre organization of the tasks, on the go monitor and easy task updates, evening evaluation keeps me focused and productive.  One way solution for people who want to become and stay productive",
"Dont waste your time, all efforts went into material design. Dgt Gtd + Pure calendar brats it in almost every aspect except UI.",
"I have tried all the agenda, todo and habit apps and none worked for me. I was about to start learning android dev just to create a productivity app that fulfils my needs. Thank god i found todoist. This is the only app that does what i need!",
Sometimes updates removes features which you are currently using but in general I'm a happy user with 4 years of experience.,
Easy to use. Nice and simple. Just what I was lacking in a task app. Plus the widget is great.,
This app reminds me of everything I need to do. Doesn't let a day go by if I forgotten something. I would recommend it for anyone who is on a tight schedule.,
"Has it been like other apps, charging a one  time price, it would have been justifiable. This is just..",
"Lots of options, multiple ways to use it. The only improvement to suggest would be a dedicated ""next action"" indicator to facilitate use for GTD applications.",
Can't rate this enough. For someone like me it's a way to organise my millions of thought processes and increase motivation. Organise tasks into priority. The only downside is that you realise you don't have enough time to do everything! Haha...,
Loving going digital with my to do lists on this app! Great to keep track of tasks and enjoy the message I get when they are complete each day. Highly recommend.,
"Even in free version it's very useful: though it doesn't allow to manage labels and filters I can still use Eisenhower's prioritization and organize tasks in projects. Great to see the tasks planned for the week and what's the next most important task. I started to use it as a browser extension a year ago, but found mobile app more convenient.  Recommend it to my friends.",
Good for managing tasks in GTD method. Allows for critical assignment of PARENT tasks as opposed to less useful sub tasks,
The todoist app has thought put into its design. I also really like the web app and it's one of the main reasons I continue to use it.,
Has some great features but not a fan of the way reminders work. Premium accounts at the time i signed up were only offered yearly so 6 months on and I'm missing ticktick since they implemented their inline date parsing.,
"I've been through tens of different todo softwares,  but Todoist is by far it's the best I've used",
"Not using with anyone else. Helps me get daily tasks done, however. Enjoy the ability to see tasks on desktop without having to log in. Just link off the email that is sent.",
"Cross platform, flexible, and more useful than glamorous any. do if you have about one hundred tasks.",
"Exactly enough features for free to be very useful. Premium offers enough benefits for the price. Works well,  no issues in several years.",
Sync of task let me track my work from anywhere & Karma has pushed me to do work more efficiently.,
"THis hearkens back to the wonderful simplicity and flexibility of the old paper-based Franklin Planners, and as a bonus, I can add items using the Alexa app and my Echo Dots.",
"Update 2: you removed this feature, so back to four stars Update1 : Thanks for adding this feature, much better now!   I have the premium version, will give it 5 stars after you enable reminders to be added when creating a task from the widget, rather than having to create the task, then manually select it and tap on the three dots and tap reminders",
This app has seriously helped my organization and productivity. I can't praise it enough!,
Easy to use for management and completion of tasks. Reordering and creating subtasks features are really good even if it takes a while to get the hang of it,
"It worths to buy premium version. I have access from anywhere from my Mac to my new Nexus phone. Also their app is compatible with the latest Android and Mac version. In addition, their intelligent text recognition and filters are unique features.",
Very helpful for the very disorganised 😊,
I use it to track home improvement projects and to help reinforce good daily habits. I love the way the tasks can keep repeating as long as I want them.,
"I've tried a number of task managers, and this is my fave. I'm a GTD fan, and Todoist allows a pretty faithful setup.",
I'm a person  who always has to schedule out what I'm doing for a week and this is great. Most importantly it doesn't crash if you have more than 10 tasks in a day!,
"I work 4 jobs and this helps keep me organized. Since the last update, the app is incredibly and take multiple times clos ing and opening to work on my S7.",
Dumping out everything in my mind into this app has been a huge relief. I use it religiously now!,
Recently started to improve my productivity and this app has been a huge help in me organising my monthly and weekly goals. Huge help thanks,
"For someone who struggles with ADD and is Autistic, this app is a godsend. Give the free version a try, it may just revolutionize your life too!",
"Todoist is the perfect simple ToDo list app. I tested lots before I settled on this - I wanted something that would sync cross-platform, could be used offline, and where info entry and retrieval was quick and easy. I've been using Todoist for my grocery and shopping lists,  and personal and house ToDos for a few yrs now, and it suits me perfectly.",
My Opinion to Enhance                                         1. Expand subtask levels from 5 to 10                        2. Allow to set timeframe instead of due date. Eg. From 15th dec2016 10pm to 20 thdec2016 5am,
"I love this app. I wish I could get notifications without paying for the premium version, but this free version is still great! Get it!",
It's a great app. I was in search for an app that could help me organize and prioritize my work well... And it's perfect for the job!,
So much better than trying to remember everything in your head! Awesome and simple interface.,
"One of the best apps for task and project management. Getting things done! Thank you,  Todoist team.",
"This app helps me with daily tasks, unlike others that are cumbersome.",
Todoist allows for enhanced productivity by cramming a host of features including natural language prediction into an interface that removes itself from distraction.,
Love how simple this app is. Daily tasks and email reminders. You won't miss your tasks next time.,
"Super efficient, user friendly and helpful utilities in one app. Now it just needs to add a pomodoro timer and I'd never need another app!",
A very convenient option. Do Try it !   -1 rating because I dont like my mail being spammed with my TODO.,
"Often these types of apps are full of useless bells and whistles that just get in the way. Todoist has a very clean interface, yet with the intelligence that is built into the app it's still very powerful.",
Really helps me to stay on top of the various activities I have in my life. It's worth taking the time to organise it properly to get the most out of it though!,
"App now hangs whenever I open it; won't load any data unless I search for something that's already in one of my lists.  Seems to be ever since the annoying addition of that forced ""reschedule"" feature - which is also making me hate the app these days.",
"This feature has been consistently asked for over the last two years and is probably the easiest requested feature to implement, yet we're still waiting for it. Still waiting as of 10/2014. It's now 6/2015 and still no dark theme. 11/2016, still no dark theme. This review will remain 1 star until it is added.   In the meantime, Any.do has already ""considered"" and added this feature.",
The app os great. I like that it informs me the amount of days my task is overdue,
"In general it's a good app but, as I see it, on home page all tasks and projects should be displayed",
Only gave it a 4 because there were a few things i came across that I wish it would do in the free version. Other wise it's great!!,
"I've tried at least 6 to-do list apps over the years.  I've liked others, but I LOVE Todoist! It is what I have been looking for- a project based app with sub projects that is simple, intuitive and effective. I've been using Todoist since early 2013 and it gets better all the time. I went from a Galaxy S3 to S5, and now to a Moto Z Play. Works great on all of them.",
I've tried a few task managers but ToDoist just works better than all of them across all devices.,
"The best ""to do list"" app or planner I have ever used physical or otherwise. The key to the apps usefulness are found in its fluidity and intuitive nature. Editing large amounts of to do items can be done in minutes. Smaller amounts? In seconds. Here's hoping todoist keeps its simplicity and stays relevant with updates for years to come.",
"Easy to use and highly functional.  It helps me keep track of everything I'm trying to remember (to do lists, shopping lists, and projects) all in one place.",
"Come on - Upgrade to Calendar View! I have been using this app for 4 years, paid, and i can't keep scheduling in and doubling up on meetings! You seriously need to incorporate a calendar view for this app! You can only look at a list....come on guys i don't want to leave but i will if i have to keep guessing what i have on a certain date!",
Name it and you can connect Todoist to it. Premium adds enough extra features to make it worth it. Being able to quickly add things via Alexa at home and OK Google in the car is a killer feature,
"I've been searching for and using several different task management apps. For my process, Todoist Premium beats Any.do, Wunderlist, RTM, and Outlook. Couldn't be happier.",
I started to use Todoist and it has immediately  improved my productivity. I would only wish to work with other productivity tools as an accelerator such as Trello,
"What is this? It looks so promising and great application, BUT you need to pay premium to activate the Reminders alarms. So this app is incomplete. How can we test if the reminders work with the sound at the exact time if it is not free?",
You can't even add a reminder to tasks without upgrading to full product.. deleted as soon as realised that. Such bs!,
Crashes when first launched every single time on google pixel please fix,
"Something recently happened... I have to load the app, then back out and close it... And then re-open in order to see any tasks.  It no longer displays anything upon initial opening.",
"Great to use for reminders, easy to add to the list and even easier to check items off.",
I dont know what I would do without this app!!!,
"Loved this app, but today is second time my tasks disappeared or were marked as done. I have so many work and personal projects, that it made a problem.",
Very happy with this app. It also has a chrome plugin which makes it easy to sync across devices.,
Just starting to figure it out.  Upgraded immediately to Premium.,
Fantastic tool but you must take the time to learn how to use all of the features before it really will benefit you! Highly recommended this app!,
Find this app very useful. Also cross platform so I can use it on browser.,
"This app has a widget that allows me to put the to do list on my home page, very useful!",
Great Tool! Be great if you can sync with a Calendaring service like Google Calendar,
Best to-do app only downside is its not a magic fairy that does everything on the list,
I had an idea and thought that it would be useful to be able to select two events and then have a sort of function to swap the timings between them.,
"Relieved all my stress, no adds, love it",
"Does what it says. Not too fancy, a good core task manager.",
Love the app helps me out an awful lot,
"Beautiful app, love the integration into other apps. Keep up the great work",
Very useful in keeping on top of everything I'm meant to be doing. Easy to use and I can access everything on a computer.,
I moved to Todoist from Google Tasks. This is a well thought out and fully functional Task manager. I'm loving it.,
I love the web based application but find the android app and widget to have several flaws and difficult navigation.,
"This product has been just what I was looking for in a productivity application and task manager. I do wish that there were additional features enabling it to become a project management tool as well, a lot of my tasks become projects all their own and get assigned to my staff, it would be nice to be able to assign a percent complete and view subtasks. Overall I love this app though!",
"Good to do list, and have a plan to use the premium soon.",
I am really impressed with this app.  It is easy to use across all platforms.,
Used several different list before able to prioritize and categorize them all here,
This expensive rubbish came with my phone so I can't delete it,
Its a very useful and awesome app. Made my day a lot more productive.,
The app is great for getting better at time management. Sure the free version lacks a few features like comments but the devs need to earn money somehow right? The free version is perfectly usable though.,
"I use it on my phone, computer, and tablet. It keeps me organized.",
Very happy with this app both the Web and the Android versions. Was well worth it very easy and useful,
As a person who has multiple projects going on at once this app has been amazing for keep all of my thoughts in one place,
A simple and seamless interface that allows me to execute my tasks at a higher level.,
"This app is easy to use,and really helpful for remind me about task that im going to do",
"Best productivity app. I've tried dozens. Very intuitive - it understands text like ""every week check budget"" and will set weekly reminders. Is there anything it can't do?",
Great app to organize work to-do items that syncs between my phone and laptop,
So far it really helps me keep on top of things. I have a terrible memory & it really helps.....& its free. Brilliant,
The most powerful yet simple productivity app in existence.,
SMS reminder flatout doesn't work. Unacceptable.,
Thank you for making me more productive! Keep Improving :),
"Very nice, however can be improved by adding all the pro features in the standard version.",
Helps keep me organized and on top of things!,
Run very smooth and helpful. Thanks developer!,
"Great themes and assets, karma points are a great touch!",
Quick and simple with sorting your tasks! It's awesome and effective!,
No more writing down notes all by voice love it,
"This app has helped so much with my productivity and organisation, I love that undone tasks just go to overdue rather than flashing up with annoying reminders all the time",
No complaints...helping me to get more stuff done. Thanks,
"I tried a lot of to-do apps, and this is definitely my favorite!",
You can quickly add tasks and change dates or mark it as complete.,
I was going back to BlackBerry until I added this app.  Love it!,
"&gt;If 2 or more tasks having diff tags are selected then tags window show nothing, hence tags can only be added but not edited &gt;Adding subtasks rite now is very difficult , u have to select task each time ,click on add subtask&gt;Option to show all sub contents of the main project & its sub, with project name being shown under the task &gt;Sort by labels?Very difficult but if done then superb &gt;Expand collapse all&gt;App lock&gt;Enter is not taken even in detailed window",
I've used this app for years and it's been great!,
See if you can integrate it with Google Assistant and Google Home device.,
This task list app does everything I need it to do.,
"It is helpful, but I wish it had a better interface",
I love that I can collaborate with my wife on our shopping list. Great app!,
"I would give it 5 otherwise, it's fantastic",
"Easy to use, help organize messy tasks.",
Great for balancing work and family life. Easy to use.,
So sick of having to log in or sign up,
"Paid for the premium version, moved from remember the milk and not looking back!",
It doesn't work.... no alert at right time..complex to use..a lort of useless categories,
very nice. omni presence on desktop and mobile. loved it.,
I have the paid subscrption and brings me a lot of value. I recommend it.,
Easy to use. All the features you need. Great for sharing to do lists.,
"Easy to use , nice graphics",
I really like this app the way your can create tasks and sub tasks list and share list the price for the pro version is a bit steep and recurring,
Everything I tried to do would cost me 13e/year,
Great app to keep you organized. Definitely easier to use on Apple vs. Android,
"Works perfect to help me stay on top of daily, weekly, and future tasks",
5 stars every day of the week. Works amazingly.,
Has made a huge difference to my productivity. A+++,
"Excellent, easy to use, wide range of features, smart rescheduling.",
Works across all platforms to help keep you on top of your to do lists.,
Great to-do and task manager,
"Super useful, free version does more than enough for what I wanted.",
"Does everything I wanted, after several years I found a great tasklist app",
This app is setup nice with alot of great features.,
Increased employer productivity by 453%. Highly recommend.,
"Easy to remember different task we have to perform daily, save time",
Found it easy to use.  Like the multi platform support.,
This is fantastic  and connected  perfect  with echo. This is a must have makes life easier,
More powerful than any other task manager I tried.,
Great app just does what it says on the tin and does it well. Every update improves the experience.,
Thanks guys. Its a great tool and great work that u ve done.,
"Well designed. It's a little quirky at first, but I'm really coming to like it.",
With that new update my list is not showing what I add on the widget even if I reschedule to today,
Great for tracking day to day work. Easy to organize your future tasks and it seamlessly integrates with Gmail.,
"If you enjoy to do lists, this is the only app you should have",
Love this app. Easy to mirror what i have on my lists,
Have todoist premium and what a mighty app it is and affordable unlike some of the competition,
Rating 5 for cust support. They assist you in no time.,
Please add the reminder option in Normal one,
Would be perfect if it contains a whole section just for notes,
Awesome widget and easy to add to do items,
Has fast sync between multiple devices,
Does the job but i think reminders are too important to be in the premium version only,
Easy to use helps me keep track of my life,
I like being able to sync tasks with my employees,
Works for many tasks easy to use,
App works great and is seamlessly compatible with Amazon echo,
Easy to use and accommodating.,
"Amazing app, simple, effective, and efficient. Helps you be efficient!",
Never had a problem with it can add tasks on the fly when out and syncs seamlessly,
Great tool. Easy to use. Understands English well enough to fill in information.,
"Ideal for an organised or structured execution, day-to-day or work - related",
Easy to use and very effective!  Good job!,
Easy to use.  Love it!,
"Amazing. Just came here to rate you guys, nothing else. ❤❤❤❤💚💚💚",
I really like the email feature it really keeps you accountable I feel obligated to do the work,
"Using Todoist to organise my life, it's doing a fantastic job!",
They are not very powerful features,
"Week one, I'm on task and on time with my work.",
I love this to do app out of all to-do apps!!,
Helpful but wish more features included in base free version.,
Just what you need. Simple and works great.,
"I like the UX and the design is quite clean, kudos for that.",
...but that's for the paid version,
The features that it has suit my needs perfectly..,
Great app but the emails can be a little annoying,
Does what it says. Tasks don't go away until done. Easily reordered.,
"Runs on anything, text shortcuts, intuitive, efficient",
Pleasing and satisfactory. Does its task beautifully.,
Def helps actually get stuff done. Should be called HoneyDo.,
"I tried, ""Alexa, add buy shoes on December 25th to my to-do list"". Alexa said, ""I've added buy shoes on December 25th, to your to-do list"". Checking the Todoist app shows ""buy shoes twenty fifth"" for December 1st 2017 (it's currently December 20th,  2016). Not only does it *consistently* get the date wrong, but it doesn't ""smartly"" interpret dates at all.",
Very nice interface. A perfect app for a busy person.,
"Nice App, it helps my productivity a lot.",
Todoist is always updated quickly and useful features are regularly added.,
Easy to navigate and organize tasks on the fly.,
"Please, don't make it confusing, it works well as it is.",
It runs in my Android phone and also on my Windows computer perfectly with the same account giving a seamless user experience,
The best ...updates across all devices...responsive...a perfect simple list recording and management system.,
Gets the job done!!,
Worth the subscription fee.,
Very good App to keep ahead of to do list.,
Great app to keep you on track!,
One of the best to-do app's around. Especially the collaborate share feature.,
Works awesome on phone web and computer!,
Amazing app - I'm loving it. Easy to use and always with me. No more scrappy notes....,
Enjoying so far. Easy and satisfying to useto use,
"Checked many, 1st one I like",
Exactly what I'm looking for,
The most simple task manager ever.,
Great for setting thinners.. Alexa integration.. Love this so,
Minimal yet rich UX,
Remembers anything you want to do,
Help me a lot in arranging my work task,
Working well so far.,

"Great app.  Probably the best to-do list manager out there.  Very intuitive and I like that you can add a due date simply by typing it (no need to open an extra window).  I use the free version which is more than sufficient for my needs, but some of the bad reviews come from those who need the features from the Pro version but don't want to pay.",
"I've liked a lot of applications initially but gradually lost interest in them. Not so with Todoist, which remains my go-to task manager three years in. Like other superb applications, Todoist does a few key things well and provides the flexibility to use the application the way you want without forfeiting simplicity. I can't overstate the value of Todoist and if you don't think the premium subscription is worth it, you don't need a task manager.",
"I like the flexibility and I am only using the free features on my phone, the Chrome extension and the Web app. Just what I needed and with no issues. No limits on number of tasks or projects and great ways to add repeating tasks using normal language.",
"I've been using todoist for almost 2 years. To have it on my phone, on my desktop, and in my Gmail makes it really convenient and easier to rein in the demands on my time--not to mention less ruled by my inbox.",
"Was good, but recently removed the ability to schedule tasks in the past, which is needed for recurring tasks that you forget to tick off on the day and don't want the schedule messed up. Looks like I'll be searching for a replacement.",
Easy to use. I like that you can create your own project labels to keep track of individual project priorities.,
"Program works well, still some features I'd like to see at it though like location controls and things like that",
Keeps me organized at home and on the go. I can share my tasks between my mobile and my PC. Love that I can share lists with others too.,
But I can't find a way to disable receiving emails abot taskt. I only want to be notified on my phone.,
It keep on remainding us via email.so we will not forget our work and finish it on time line,
"This is my first time using this kind of thing and its simple, but exactly what I need. My productivity has multiplied 10 fold!",
"I used it as a mobile endpoint for the desktop app (web) but now it is my main interaction point with todoist. Great app, well performing, comes with a great quick access widget and is intuitive and fast to use. 👍",
"Works well, but it takes some time to figure out all the features. Very useful app though, and great for separating your to do list into work, personal and other categories.",
Excellent app. Keeps me from forgetting the millions of tasks I have to do each day.  It syncs seamlessly between my Android phone & my iPad. Gotta love that!,
I'm a writer and researcher and this amazing app is now very much an important tool in my work - love it.,
Very user friendly with reminder options.  My is synced to my email which then sycns to my computer and tablet so set up was very quick.,
"The app is good, but it's the Outlook integration that has really helped me stay on top of all the To Do's that flow into my daily work load.",
"Works great for managing multi-faceted admin work. Excellent way to create mini reminders for oneself or colleagues on the fly - equivalent to scheduling future post it notes. The filtering tool is indispensable. Wish there were more options in Premium for reviewing, sorting/filtering, and downloading completed tasks - would be useful as work reports.",
And it really helps. Number of things getting done is increasing,
"Read a GTD book, download it, pay the premium for all of your life, forget all the other app that attempt to do the same things, and Get your things done! Just a wonderful app, but improve it everyday, with the same enthusiasm!",
"Uninstalled immediately as soon as the thing forced me to either ""signup"" or login with google. I don't want to do either.",
"I put the widget in my home screen and every time I open my phone I get reminded of everything I have to get done today. Then, I get it done.",
I searched very hard and for a very long time to find the right software to use with Gtd system. This fits perfectly and help me keep focused,
I'd recommend this app for anyone that wants to be more organised. great that it automatically sync's with my PC. Very easy to use. Some times it is very easy to forget things. With this app you won't.,
"Hi! I really like your app, but I'd prefer having the widget to show all projects rather than just 1. Please revert back, thanks :)",
"It's like a going to your closet. You store every task in a specific place. When you need it, either you get it or it'll appear the day you chose.",
Simple app. Very reliable. Works with Amazon echo.,
Only suggestion I can think of is that I'd like individual reminders for tasks.,
"I like this app very much.   I do find however,  that multiple due dates would be helpful",
"Unable to set multiple dates for a single task like (every monday, friday) only shows Monday. Even (monday, friday) only shows Monday.",
"I hate lists. I love Todoist! And it's not the cheesy karma points that makes me love it. It's the simplicity/feature ratio,  which is perfect for getting stuff done!",
"Does what it says, for free. No constant bugging to upgrade. Integrates seemlessly across all devices. Love it",
I was this close to buying premium for this app until I learned that it was subscription. This app is not worth €13.99 per year when there are other apps that do similar things for much cheaper. Subscriptions just suck in general too.,
The ability to set recurring reminders is a fantastic feature.,
"Works for big projects, trips to the store, or just remembering to make a phone call",
"Excellent lists with all the functionality I need. Latest update won't re-open from background unless I close the app (Nexus 5X). (Thanks for the response, rating updated.)",
"Todoist is the best way to keep my to do list organized across my iPhone, tablet and laptop.  Love it!",
Exactly the sort of thing I was trying to do with excel sheets all these years !,
Don't know how I'd run my business or life without it.,
"So far, so good. This is one of few apps I found that work on both my Android phone and my Windows laptop, so that in itself is amazing! And technical support is just awesome!",
Defnitely easy to use and convenient...syncs from phone to pc so it can be used anywhere!,
I'm still learning my way around but this is a great multiplatform alternative to omnifocus,
Extremely helpful productivity app with a simplistic layout.,
Perfect To do app! I use it to organize my whole life.,
Great app for a to list. Works well for grocery lists too. Able to share lists.,
Nothing much different from other should be able to sync with other app,
"I Loved it. Easy to use, well structured to do application",
"Clean interface, smooth operation, email reminder overall a pretty good app.",
"I've used Todoist for years. It's easy, convenient, helps me organize and plan, it's great. I do wish they didn't bother showing me premium features I can't use, but that's not a deal breaker. :)",
The interface is clean and intuitive. It fulfills its role perfectly.,
Great tool to get things done and leading a disciplined life.. :),
"Great app.  Rating this app was actually on my to do list, now I can say I did it!",
"even better when used with Zapier, automating task filling and completion",
Everything nice about it is after purchase which sucks,
I am feeling better to achieving daily and projection work after using this app,
"Simple, but very effective!",
It made my work so easy,
This app has proven very handy for my lack of brain cells and a poor memory,
Working properly well,
Keeps me organised!,
"Easy to use, straightforward and stable.",
Keeps me on task!,
To stroke off a completed task!,
Love that todoist lets me organize tasks however I want and that its scheduling system automatically promotes tasks to my focus when they become relevant,
The best To-Do list app,
List was just what I needed Thanks Mark,
Nothing more to say,
Extremely useful n simple to use,
Very good tool for keeping everything on track..,
Tempted to even buy the full version!,
Top class form and content 😊,
Love this app!,
Good tool for keeping on top of things!,
Caught on to using todist quickly.,
Nice interface but no sorting,
"Looks good, works great!",
"Love the ""command line"" Perfect multiplatform.",
The email notifications reminds you of task that needs to be completed.,
Excellent app. Love the widget,
"Focused design, best buy",
Just what I was looking for!,
Need premium to use most of the features.,
Awesome apps!,
Really useful application!,
Makes organizing life easier,
Best task app ever,
It is awsome,
Very helpful,
Love it,
Awesome planner for BoneOS,
In the bin,
Works like it says,
Good and useful,
Easy to use,
Reminder in upgrade version....  Why!!!!!!,
I have used this religiously to keep track of school assignments and personal items. The free version is enough to use it well.,
Useless,
Love it,
Excellent,
"The extensive capability of Outlook means that it is still a potent tool, and it's desktop capabilities are still very necessary for many of us. Create a Todoist desktop app that displaces my Outlook task manager and let's me create tasks, offline, for delayed sync, including my Outlook mailboxes, and you'll have a bases-loaded grand slam home run. (Amended response) Hi Doist, I have Todoist on my desktop with Outlook, yes but it's not an integrated experience. Does not work in an integrated manner with my calendar, and I cannot use my mail commands (flag and date) to ping to Todoist. I would love to know that I'm wrong as I want to go pro with you. IFTTT does not solve the problem. I have only been able to create 2 useful recipes and with Outlook for Android at that, plus they are cumbersome.",
"I have been using Todoist for the past 6 months as my sole task manager within my ""modified"" GTD system. Very streamlined and intuitive interface; yet with the capability of tracking sub tasks, recurring tasks, due dates and text reminders.",
No more lost paper notes are wandering memos on the phone. And assigning tasks allows for a bit of collaboration.,
Excellent cross-platform  usability - has become indispensable! Still using it after 3 years.,
"Why? This app was amazing until the last update. Why do my overdue tasks always have to be at the top now even when I click to see only the ""today"" or ""next 7 days"" tasks?",
Every 12 is working for recurring but 12th of every month does not work.,
"Love it, and the outlook app for the desktop.",
Easy to use works for what I need,
One tje perfect apps lhave seen,
Application Delivers ☺,
Easy menu,
Amazing!,
Still best,
Liked it,
Does the job,
"I love Todoist, but what it needs and what is really important to me is that finished task should not disapear, the should be marked as finished and go to a seperate box of finished task asigned to the date. At the end of the day or a week, when doing my work report I cannot check what I have done, I have to write on a peace of paper the task before I thick it off. Only this way I can prove to myself looking at the done task at the end of the day how productive I and contemplate at the specific done task.",
"I use this in conjunction with planner for all those little things that I tend to forget but don't find important enough to write in my planner. I help run a few Facebook groups so in order to keep up with everything I would need two or three planners. I love this app for this purpose. I can label and group each item, time stamp or just keep it in my to do box. It also has an option to send an email but that's just a convenience. I seriously am in love with this app. I have so much more to write but it's :)",
"Ignore older reviews - this is one of the very best to-do apps - and largely because they keep making it better and better. The ability to type inline commands in the task title is superb and makes it so easy to create a task for what you want, when you want, with the formatting and labels that you want in a flash.  Agree with other comments that Karma points are arbitrary. Hey-Ho :-)",
"I am highly dependent on lists for productivity. I've used task software from free to enterprise-level, but still needed my daily paper post-its to stay on task...until now. Todoist has exactly the look and ease of my paper lists, with the added bonus of recurring items. Intuitive and syncs beautifully.",
"clean, simple to use, helpful, great widget. my only real complaint is that there is no way to make the sorting options permanent so that they automatically apply to new entries. I want to be able to add new tasks from the widget and have it sorted by priority without having to open the app.",
Great tool to keep my ToDo.  Very fast and fluid interface.  Only concern I have is seeing a list of finished tasks and requiring a paid version to see that seems unreasonable.  My workaround to create a Finished list and manually move them.  Other than that very happy with the app.,
"Todoist is so easy to use.  No need to enter the task then chose a date from a pull down menu and then chose a time from another pull down menu  - time consuming and error prone. With this app you just enter a task such as: Take dog to the groomer Fri 3pm and the task is entered for Friday at 3pm.  Recurring tasks, alerts, ability to prioritize tasks and to organize by folder and sub-folders are all there in Todoist.  I truly have nothing negative to say about this super convenient and good looking app.",
"I've tried lots of different to-do apps, but I tend took come back to this one for its simplicity and ease of use. It takes me half the time to enter an item in todoist. It helps me stay organized. I only wish the pro accounts cost a bit less.",
I have always used lists to keep track of my responsibilities and other items which need to remembered. It started with paper and pen and progressed to various apps on my smartphone. To-doist does everything I need and I have transferred all my lists into it. Thank you for creating such a useful app,
"I had been searching for perfect to-do app for me and this is it. There is one little bug at least on my Nexus 6p. When I try to add a task with a date following it first and then a label, sometimes the text got wrapped wrongly between the date and the label. I am unable to replicate this bug as of today. But yesterday I came across it. Anyway, love the app.",
Time Reminders should really be free features though. Paying 40 dls a year for that feature is crazy considering I'm not a power user. Not having those available for free made me switch away after using it for a long time.,
"I use this for everything now instead of trying to keep track of paper lists for school, work, home, etc. It's FANTASTIC. I love how easy it is to organize and adjust items. I've only come across maybe one or two things it isn't able to do. I love that I can prioritize and color code everything. :)",
"So far so good, it is everything I needed it to be and then some. Excellent tech support as well, very timely response and helpful with an access issue I caused when I first signed up.  The add-in with Outlook is great.  You can easily turn emails into tasks.  Very flexible labeling, filters and easy search capabilities to find tasks.  I've set mine up to follow GTD (getting things done) philosophy.  Thanks for the great app!",
"All to do software and methods are a little make worky and clunky.  Thus one is simple and has ability to use tags,  projects etc.  Getting others to adopt was not easier than Asana,  Wunderlist or any of the others.  Overall very intuitive,  works well for me!",
"I very rarely purchase apps, and even less often do I sign up for subscriptions. I did however buy into this app as it helped me make big changes in my life, boosted my productivity through the roof. I love the quick commands, the seamless integration, and the feedback metrics.",
"Setting up your preferences is straight forward enough and initially I tended to think I wouldn't really benefit from a to-do list. I think I was of the opinion it was for office types who will always tell you there aren't enough hours in the day etc. I found over time however, it's extremely useful in terms of ensuring you take care of day to day things, no matter how simple or complicated. It sync's beautifully across all devices and I have upgraded to utilise all the features available. I have tried other highly recommended to-do app's but would say this is best of them for me. I love too, the sync with Google Calendar.",
Has all the features required for the getting things done approach and the user interface is intuitive and fast. 100% recommended.,
"Still missing start date... after almost a year now. AI may be fine, but this less complicated thing would mean so much more to me: an uncluttered view, and seeing only what I need to see when I need to see it.",
"Really easy to use, keeps me organized and on top of things. Would love Google Calendar Integration",
This sits in my Outlook email window so I just add emails for follow up to todoist where I can manage them better. It keeps my life in order.,
"Ok, this is the fourth edit. I tried to like it, but can't. This app won't tell you when a task is due without the 40 dollars a year fee!!  It is worthless to most if it won't remind you that you need to address something. In other words, no alarm when you wish to be reminded. The developers stripped one of the most important functions out. Oh well, it is pretty but see ya....",
Best to do app on the market hands down. Truly helps me stay organized with my business tasks as well as my personal. One of those few things that really make life more manageable.,
I use todoist for all of my personal and work related lists. I especially like being able to share them so easily.,
Easy to add items on the fly. And helps remeber things you tend to forget after meetings or teleconference.,
"the interface is clean, but not compact. Subtasks are present, but a bit uncomfortable to work with (e. g.  duplicate in lists under some conditions), no simple inventory checklists for tasks such as shopping etc, no custom sort and grouping in smart lists. In general, good but not perfect.",
"Todoist is by far the best way I manage all my tasks, whereas I use Evernote as a reference system. A perfect combo for Getting Things Done.... Todoist Premium... Worth the money",
I am enjoying using Todoist on Android. The interface makes lots of use of standard Android functionality and I can concentrate on my work.,
"I love this app, it motivates me to accomplish things and is a great way to keep track of tasks that need to be done in a simple but pretty format. I just wish I could tweet off of the app instead of just the website. Maybe I just haven't figured it how to yet.",
"Enjoyable to use and works pretty well, but while I will miss attaching files or commenting on tasks I'm not gonna pay for premium.",
"This app is complex and complicated in areas where that's completely unneeded (gimmicks),  while at the same time being underwhelming and uncustomizable in areas where you want depth.",
"Does everything I need. Superb integration with all devices. Good UI. Have tried others, some very expensive, but still prefer the ease of use of Todoist.",
I previously used another app which stopped working. Force me to find a new app . Luckily I found this app and have been using ever since. Works great across all my platforms ..always in sync.,
"Solid app with a lot of useful features for collaboration. Wish there were smart features, like entering a phone number and having it queue up, but overall, love how it is available everywhere and easy to use",
"I used to use a diary, now everything is on my phone. Quick to add and edit.",
"Apart from many other good features, one good feature it has, which is not found in any other TODO Apps is, we can have any number of levels of tasks. Most other Apps ate limited to 2 or 3 levels",
I have been needing this app for a decade now. Haven't even explored all features yet. Sharing lists with others makes it really relevant.,
Great for categorising lists and reminding me of what I still need to do even if the scheduled day has passed. Wish it was easier to schedule task on specific day though.,
"It was just fine, why would you need to update it and make it worse?? Now I cannot set the date for the task from the widget. I have to add a task then go the app itself to set the date! Twice as mane actions than before! One more update like this and the app will be too much pain to handle!",
"Tried a bunch of these, this has some bells and whistles, but still easy to use",
I had notifications turned off and still got a text at 4 a.m. that woke me up.  No thanks.,
"I enjoy using this app, it makes me feel like I'm actually doing things lol. The only reason it's not five stars is because of the lack of subtasks, but otherwise it is a superb app",
"No thank you, I just want an app to make shopping lists, to do lists and perhaps a reminder now and then. I don't need an app that wants access to accounts and I have to set up an account and log in to use.",
"For a guy who had constant trouble organizing minor chores, this has been extremely helpful. I'm simply way more organized with it. Thanks!",
The app is very easy to use and easy to see all of the things you need to take care of.,
I really needed to do list. This works great and can be accessed on my phone or at my computer. Easy to use.,
"Love the app, but can't find it in my budget to pay for it. Free version doesn't allow me to see finished tasks (activity log) so I'm gonna be on the lookout for a different app.",
"Hi Todoist, I like app but there is 1 MAJOR problem from a USEABILITY perspective. The App Notifications says 'you have 2 dues tasks today' - WHO CARES!! (this is irrelevant to me and doesn't create the urgency and focus I may need on the task I have created, I want to know WHAT TASKS!  ...i want to see 'Get Milk' 'Pick Up Cat from Vet' etc GIVE ME THE NAME OF MY TASKS!  otherwise I simply swipe the 'you have tasks' notification away and don't use the app. $44/yr for Reminders in a To-Do App?? Come on guys!",
A great app with easy to use interface. Two features that i would really like the developers to introduce is having the start date of tasks with due dates and ability to put recurring tasks with back due date. Thanks,
Sure 5star app. But i would like to have reverse list sorting.  New tasks to be added on top of the list not in the bottom.,
"It sends reminder next day through notification & also through mail,if u have not marked any pending task as done. This is d best part of it.",
"I've tried this and a couple other list management apps, and thus far, this one fits my style best.",
I've tried a few others but always came back.,
Syncs with pc and has good features. I had to reset my phone but recovered the list when I logged in to Todoist,
Simple and beautiful interface. Not too irritating but gets the job done.,
"I'm a list loving SAHM and this app is great for it! I love the reminders, urgency levels and the price for pro. I don't use any of the sharing with others, but I'm sure it would be great for working a job!",
My wife's already using wunderlist and inbox so I need to find how integrate with these two apps.,
"The UI is intuitive and the reminder system is very useful. This app helps me to be much more productive, I love it.",
"Useful for basic planning, too bad there is no calendar integration, no premium = not many features, slightly gameified which is cool but can also be counterproductive",
"Wasn't going to spend the money, until I realized I was going to spend this much on Task book in the store. This is great because it's always with me!",
I have had premium and the free and I think the free is still fine but the premium just fine-tune it. I would like my projects to be always open though as that would make it quicker for me to add stuff as I'm going along.,
"To do list helps me to write down everything so that I don't have to worry about it anymore and organize it in projects or prioritize it, it's been awesome!",
I've always been used to managing my workload. So when I retired this great little app helped me plan my daily activities and remind when essential jobs around the house needed my attention. It's easy to use and a great aid memoir.,
Such a great way to manage my daily tasks. I can even assign individual tasks to my better half! Brilliant interface and syncs extremely well between all other devices.,
So useful. You can have different lists for all your projects and schedule them. I tried a few list/organizer apps first and this is my favourite by far.,
The entire suite of Todoist apps are brilliant. They work well on the platforms they are designed for and the features are just awesome.,
"Integration with the browser app plus features for sorting,  scheduling and categorizing tasks makes my life so much better",
I like that Alexa can tell me what I have in my list for the day. Very helpful.,
This is super useful for sorting out my rota shifts and house chores. I love that I can customise the repeat space between tasks and it's not set to default options only. Super useful app and never use a problem with it. I can sync it to my PC and phone so my partner can see it too.,
"I've tried many many productivity services over the years and this is the first time I can stick to one, because it's simple and does just what matters, rather than focus on fancy useless features",
"Extremely effective, great way to turn ideas and tasks into action plans, and out from my head so that I can conserve mental energy. Love Todoist!",
Such a useful app. I download all my tasks here from my brain as soon as I think of them or am given them. Declutters my brain and makes me more productive and consistent.,
"I have tried several different task scheduling apps for Android, and Todoist is clearly the best. It has great flexibility in creating categories, and is easy and quick to use, even across my phone and tablet. Recommended!",
"The filtering, tagging, & priority flags make this a great tool for not only getting things done, but deciding what's truly important to devote energy to, depending on the time available (only 24 hours in a day, after all). Plus a great design & UI. Definitely worth the yearly subscription.",
Very easy to use. I'm a stay at home dad and suffer with memory loss due to a moderate concussion. This app is a tremendous help in tracking my daily chores and tasks.,
"Great for many approaches to productivity inclusing GTD. Mobile app is fast, easy to use and syncs with desktop-generated data.",
"I really enjoy how the app is integrated between Google chrome and a native app, its interface is easy to use, but very powerful. I use this app for everything from grocery lists to homework assignments to extensive project checklists to goalsetting",
Keeps me current on all my tasks. No more forgotten appointments and missed episodes of my favorite shows. Don't know what I'd do without it!,
"Now I don't have to have lots of lists written on numerous pads and can organise my work each day, achieving more of my deadlines.",
"Been using it for two years now. Helps me massively to organise my life. Thanks for the app, Todoist team!",
👍👍👍,
"This app has changed my 10 year old life, it has helped me remember things. Get this app",
"This app helps me get through business as well as everyday life. I love the color coding and the fact it reminds you every morning to check your list every morining. Its easy to use and os very helpful. I tried many to do apps, but this my favorite by far. Thumbs up🖒",
"nuf said. Over the years, I've used one app or another with projects, priority, contexts and so on, and it's real easy to navigate, add and generally maintain an accurate task list. I'm looking forward to going pro and also integrating with Toggl. Google now integration a big plus!",
"The best task app, well integrated into gmail as well.   Works smoothly, offers many options how to customize and manage your work, syncs through everything.",
I'm learning the GTD method and have been using Todoist to implement my projects. So far it's working great!,
"Previously I had a great difficulty in managing my schedules as I keep forgetting them. Now with the aid of this app, that problem has been reduced to a great extent. I simply have to thank the team for this great app. Gracias!",
Love that it syncs worth browser and laptop apps.  It's everywhere and always current.  No excuses now,
"Have self minuses, but best what I used.",
It's a pretty good app. Just a bit annoying all the emails notifications!,
"I only use basic features but it has a nice layout, works smoothly, and doesn't lag!",
"Can create as many child tasks as i want. This is an indispensable quality  for me. Downside: Without premium membership, no comments are allowed :(",
Easy to use. Great product. Love location based reminders. Cross platform use (Android &  iOS) and web app excellent features too.,
"I've used to do lists for years and this is the best one to date, and still only using the free version. Update - now a year on and not changed my mind; and it's fun to use .",
This is everything I want in a to-do list app. You can add and delete them straight from the widget! It's exactly what I was looking for.,
"I can only type with one finger right now so I would say more if I could but yeah it's simple and easy, I suggest upgrading some of the stuff I want to use is in the full version but I'm broke asf.",
This is one of the most complete task management platforms available and they hit that sweet spot of being good for both personal and business use.,
One of the best To-Do apps I have ever used. Lots of features and a great UI.,
For those days when you have too much to do and don't even know where to start.,
I like having my to do list on my phone & email reminders. It's helping me be much more productful.  Simple to use & works great.,
Premium is seriously worth it.   I am a project manager running 3 jobs and it really helps me focus on accomplishing daily tasks without having to keep it all in my head.,
Does all of the task management things that Google calendar can't.,
Gets all the junk in your head out in front of you.,
I have used a number of todo apps over the years but todoist provides one of the very few cross platform options and a great one at that. I am by no means a GTD master but continue to use it to get through my daily grind of tasks.,
I use it everyday. .... the project division is wonderful to keep track of every aspect that need to be completed before going forward to another step in your project or sub project! Nice work guys. ....,
I was going to make my own but this does almost everything I was thinking about building.,
"Super compatible app that integrates easily into your browser, phone, desktop, etc. This app has already helped me stay on track with goals, reminders and much more. Worth the download!",
Helps keel you on top of things. Notifications are great too.,
"It's wonderful, sleek, fast, available on every (seriously) device! You can use it however you want, from shopping list to full fledged GTD system. Completely worth the yearly subscription for the pro version too. And the team, blog and support are great too!",
I haven't gotten the premium version yet but I probably will.,
Really happy with the application. Currently working through getting my life in order and this is really helping.,
"Simple enough to not be confusing, yet has features for fine tuning if you want to use them.  Cross platform, multi-device works fantastic!",
Loved it and would give it 5 out of 5 if I were also able to see my completed tasks.,
It just keeps spamming and spamming my email like some deranged Duracell bunny.,
I've always loved making to do lists. And todoist takes me to level expert.  One of the most useful apps on my phone!,
"Excellent app: Among many features, hierarchy feature and cross device syncing really boost productivity!",
Best part is that it delivers daily tasks that are outstanding which is terrifying for all procrastinators,
"So easy to use, fulfills the need of making an on paper list. Being able to swipe away tasks is awesome!",
So simple and easy to use and keep track of things. A must have for doers,
It's a simple app and it's great at what it does. Furthermore it synchronises all the tasks across my Mac and my android phone.,
It does what the description says... but you have to pay $28.99/year if you want it to sync with your calendar. Liken most my calendar is already done and i don't see why i need to lease an app... ridiculous.,
I've become a lot more productive and organized. It's very helpful.,
"Hint, use ""If This Then That"" app to sync your Google calendar events with todoist.",
"Easy to use,clear and simple but versatile. Essential for anyone with ADHD.",
"I'm using it everyday. This app is amazingly simple, powerful and flexible.",
Reminders not intrusive but enough to get things done,
"One of the best free to do list apps I've used. With premium, the best to do list app I've ever used!",
"Overpriced. There are  identical cost competitive alternatives,  alike free Clear list",
Simple and does the job. I particularly like the Alexa integration. Five stars!,
Nice way to keep track of things,
This is the best version of Todoist so far. Especially the multiple task input. Thanks!,
A nice simple to do list with some great features.,
Very organized. Too many emails though.,
Must have if your as forgetful as me,
"I especially enjoy using the integration between Todoist, Amazon Echo, and IFTTT.",
It's the best there is for on-the-fly task management,
"It is sad that something as basic as reminders is a payed function, you can easily put at least a demo I don't want to pay 30 bucks to check if maybe is worthy just to have reminders. Maybe a demo of a few weeks at least?",
"Struggling with ADD and Todoist makes my days so much more simpler, organized and less stressful.",
"Ce qui me manque le plus, c'est de pouvoir encoder des tâches récurrentes, que ce soit journalières, hebdomadaires ou fréquence à déterminer librement. Ou bien cela existe et je ne l'ai pas vu? Ok, réponse bien reçue. Tellement simple et intuitif! Il suffit donc d'utiliser le mot pour la récurrence, comme ""chaque lundi"", ou ""tous les 3 jours"". Super!",
Simplistic UI that gets the job done,
Makes my life more productive. Thank you Doist team!!,
Flexible and such a clean clear interface. Works everywhere. Perfect.,
Good app but if there are negative points for to doing the task it will be better also reminder,
Great app disappointing that so much is off limits for the free edition,
In some ways it's even better.,
"It would be great if the default ""type"" van be configured. (Work, Personal)",
Use it everyday more and more. Must have app!,
Just perfect. Keeps me on track without too many nags,
"One of my best apps,  a must have",
Best to-do list application I have ever used.,
User friendly and not overloaded.,
A must-have app if you want to stay organized.,
"Tried many, this is the best with all the right features and access on all devices.",
Nice app... quite helpful. Doesn't make you skip your priority. A reminder would just be amazing for the same.,
"Great app, would be even better with Google Inbox and reminder integration.",
Definite recommend if you love being productive!,
Does what it says and more. Can't really fault it.,
"Well organized,  attractive-looking, and great UI.",
"So fa so good, i am new with this app but really enjoy it",
"With the organised project folders, Todoist helps me achieve my organised best",
"Simple, intuitive and works well!",
Keeps me on track with my HW! I have it on my home screen so I see what I need to do every time I turn on my phone!,
I've used a bunch of to-do and use it hashtags to categorize and date is helpful and easy to use,
Great App! Helps me stay organized and productive!,
As above,
Much is behind subscription. But very good as a free app.,
It help my everyday to plan my day!,
Great app that lets you quickly set and review tasks across all devices,
"Does the job, as expected.",
Very easy to use.  Can collaborate well with others.,
Great app.  Have recommended to my friends. Thanks,
Well designed. Easy to use. Highly recommended.,
"Great, but lacking much of PC Client Functionality",
The interface is easy to understand and mail alerts on daily basis helps me plan accordingly,
"As they say ""it just works""",
Great job making this app + chrome ext!!! Thanku,
"Does its job, good ui",
Amazing app. Thats just all you need to know,
"Good interface, easy to use.",

"Small, Fast and Easy to use",
Simple to use and connects with PC and email,
Very useful to remind me of all urgent matters,
One of the best task management tools out there,
Best task manager app I've seen,
Very easy to use!,
One of the best app on Android. I just loved it on iPhone. Loving it on Android too! 5/5!!!!,
Really nice for the forgetful,
Very functional and easy to use.,
Ok very functional as a free version.,

Reliable. Brilliant  structuring.  Easy to use,
Great way to get and keep organised.,
Top app! Gebruik het dagelijks,
It almost demands you to be organized,
Finally a to do app company that gets it,
Cant even set reminders for free,
"Great, probably best business to do app",
Top integrated app,
Makes organizing my days much easier.,
Very handy,
Streamlines the house chores the best,
Enjoying it,
I don't like that the reminder is with money becuse you Downlode  a to do list to remained you,
Premium is very expensive.,
Really brilliant job guyz!!,
"Reliable, full of features, a mature to-do list app.",
Exactly what I was looking for.,
Great app for personalised tasks.,
Cool and useful app.,
"Now, if only it would actually DO the tasks I put into it.",
A great todo app.,
It's great,
plz add lockscreen option.,
"Why? It's a to do list and the reminder is premium, really.",
Pretty damn good.,
Nice app for improving workflow!,
I even paid for a year.   Nice.,
"Just that, good.",
"I like it, it helped me to finish many pending tasks",

"Old design already needs so many taps to enter all into (at least two taps to change anything). Adding or editing a task with the new design is even bigger hassle, can't grasp all information about a task at a quick glance, then two or more taps is needed. Really consider switching if this is not being improved within the next week or two.",
"There is a significant battery drain in the latest version on Android 7 (16% of Nexus 6P battery in two hours in background). Seems to be related to another issue when the app can't reconnect to ToDoist servers if I start editing in a no-coverage zone. If I forget to force quit ToDoist, I have a completely drained battery by midday.",
"The basic version is quite good but they definitely hold back 80% of the functionality for the paid version. I am sorry but $40 Canadian per year is crazy for an app that literally just stores a database. I know they have to pay for servers and such but maybe at $5 per year I could justify it. Who knows, maybe the paid version is worth it but man that price is just too steep.",
This app follows the age old advice that everything should be a simple as it can be but no simpler.  The stand out features are the most flexible recurring date types you can imagine and highly customizable widget to make one stop shopping for your task management.  This is the one To-do maker to rule them all.,
There's a lot of things that sit unused if you don't buy the premium version. The Add Task option is nice but you could just as easily get that from Google Keep. I do really appreciate the Karma points to motivate me though. This is my first try of a to do list app so I don't have a lot to compare it to.,
"Sometimes after using it on the Google Chrome plugin plugin, I open it on the Android app to find the order of the tasks all completely randomised including sub tasks randomly assigned to other parents. It takes 10 to 30 minutes of my day to reorganize everything back into the correct order. It's so bad that I am now considering moving to another app.",
"I love the project design abilities in this app, and the language capabilities to plan your task due dates is very clean; however, selling reminders as a premium feature needs to change. It's too necessary of a to-do list ability, that there are plenty of work-arounds using other apps. The is definitely not a one-stop to-do list.",
"This is my first one of these sorts of programs, and it's been really good for me. It helps me organize and bring structure to my life. Great interface, easy to use, works well, no complaints. If I used other similar things maybe I could have more criticisms, but in the first place I'm a fan of only needing one app like this, and there's nothing more I need than this. So I give 5 star/ would recommend.",
"It's a highly polished to-do app: implements Material Design, supports Android Wear and notifications, syncs to the cloud, and has clients for a surprising number of platforms. The company responds promptly when I report issues. I even consider it a plus that their pricing model appears sustainable: they charge a reasonable annual amount for labels and filters, which serious users will want. That said, there are some rough edges, and Todoist just gives you building blocks. If you're here to do GTD, you may find it challenging to define projects, labels, and filters that make sense for you.",
This app is very well built and would very easily suit all of my purposes if i were just looking to use my phone. What this application needs is the ability to not just set reminders on your android wear but also view them and mark them as complete. If im at work and i dont have my phone on me i still want to be able to knoe what i need to do next.,
"I've installed numerous to-do apps and this one is by far the best one. It is very customizable when setting dates for reoccurring events. The only drawback is when you have a certain task that needs to be completed multiple times during the day. For instance, if you want to add ""brush teeth"" for twice a day, you would need to add TWO tasks as opposed to adding ONE task that needs to be checked twice during the day.",
"I've tried many of the other to-do list apps for the sake of productivity. The feature that always steered me away from the (free version of) Todoist is that it doesn't allow for push notifications... But those never helped me, the fact that I can have the Todoist app on my phone, as well as both of my computer's is what makes me enjoy it so much more. I'm glad I'm using it now",
"I loved Things on IOS and Mac. But Apple has overcharged me too many times and I've moved to more open and robust technologies. Todoist has features that triumph over Things for GTD. But I want to control when my tasks appear and their due dates separately. If I have something due long from today,  but I want to see it in case I have time to do it,  I either set a fake due date,  which is dangerous,  or review a query far into the future. Part of GTD is not processing more than once, and this makes it many.",
"My girlfriend recommended ToDoist because I've struggled with organization and time management for years. I've found that it's simple to use and it has improved my productivity significantly. I like the Gmail extension so I can easily create tasks from emails, and the Chrome extension that allows me to create tasks from web pages. It's pretty amazing.",
Just making small goals for every day has made me so much more productive. The feeling of checking everything off at the end of the day is great! This app is easy to use and gives you just enough reminders to make sure you get things done without being really annoying about it. Highly recommended,
"Felt so much in love with the free version that i could not stop talking about it all the time. Fortunately, my dearest friend gifted to me the premium version. It is totally worth it! Now I can see my completed items. Love the Gamification technique, karma. Download todoist today and, ""karma kiye jaa phal ki ichcha mat kar""!",
"Makes it easy to break down and organize your tasks,  stay on top of them, and become more productive.  Seamlessly syncs across multiple platforms, and is integrated into all the devices and applications you use most.  Great app.",
I highly recommend this task management app. Have already asked my two overseas clients to start using it. The only problem is there is no active way of keeping track of your completed tasks. This feature must be incorporated for those who want it.,
"This is a new review -  Recently, I've become a convert of David Allen's Getting Things Done. However, Allen himself does not go to great lengths as to which digital system to to use. That's where Todoist comes in and it handles beautifully. In the past, I used todoist just like any other to do app and it was awesome. Crisp, clean, and simple. Guess what? It packs a hell of a lot more making it the best out there. You can make it your own and own your day! Just get it.",
"This app is unable to run stand alone on my phone without a login. There is no reason a to do list should have mandatory login. Give me the to do list. Then have an OPTION to log in and sync across platforms. That way you are providing the app that you advertise and letting the users select the OPTION to use your features, or not.",
"Does what it states simply put. They have apps for pretty much every platform along with a web application. The integrations are a huge bonus too. All together though it's the perfect app for someone who lives an agile lifestyle with lots of tasks that need to be done just in time. It's also wonderful for group and team projects as you can collaborate on lists as well. I've used it with everything from school/work projects, to managing a distributed grocery and chore list for my household.",
Each task takes too much real estate on the screen; too many notifications - both app popups and also emails and I can't find out if that is customizable to reduce or say stop emails. Little info on website for users; no simple comparison chart to see if premium addresses any of these issues. Lovely looking but these small things end up being very annoying. Would pay for a better customization set.,
"A really nice and fun application to organize your stuff but the problem is that its very poor before upgrade, you can barely try some options. Finally, would like it to be updated and open more than one account at the same time.",
"I have tried a lot of productivity apps out there. I keep on coming back to todoist any time I try something new. The design is clean, keyboard shortcuts make it super easy to add and change tasks and collaboration is simple. The only thing todoist lacks is a dark theme.",
"I particularly enjoy being able to sort things into projects, tasks and sub-tasks, it's really helpful if you're busy with more than one thing at a time.",
"After having tried many to-do apps (none of which I was able to use in my routine), I found Todoist to be ny go-to to-do app. I upgraded to premium from day 1! The projects, labels and filters are just what I need.  The only thing I'd like to see added is the ability to add attachments from the mobile app as well.",
"I tried almost every task-related app on play store. I have been using other apps until recently, I just started using this app again and I was really impressed with what they have achieved, it seems this was created for Ocd people like me who must have everything written down completely organised. Loved it !!",
"I use the app as an aide-memoire, being a bit forgetful. Nice layout and easy to navigate. One small point: it doesn't seem to sort items in date order automatically - unless I've missed something somewhere.",
"stuff like labels and all would be awesome but that comes with premium; which is wayy too expensive. I've never seen an app demand that amount from a customer before (something like 28$) but other than that, this is so good for managing things and I definitely recommend downloading it !",
I find it hard to believe that such a basic function like getting notifications isn't on the free version,
Few things I would improve on but overall a great app.  Its cross platform integration is brilliant.  It works smoothly and brings focus.,
"I'm not going to pay them $2.50 a month FOREVER just to have ""premium"" features which are basic necessities for a to-do list. If it were one reasonable price I would definitely buy this product to unlock all it's features, but I'm not subscribing to it. There are too many suitable free options out there.",
"Fantastic app, it's my todo app for many things in life. From groceries, to small private projects, places to visit, organize my daily tasks, or my work.   And the features that it has here and there, add up to a great tool that improves my day and keeps reminding me not to procrastinate.",
"This is slicker than similar apps I have tried and I feel I have been rewarded for sticking with it. Could use a calendar and that would really round it off. However, its narrow focus is a plus because it is excellent at task organisation.",
"I like this app overall but am really annoyed with the lack of space-economy in the big widget. In Todoist i can see only one or two items whereas with Wunderlist I see 5 items in the same widget size. Overall, the app is well thought-out and a boon to my organizational efficiency.",
"This application has helped me get organized,  I used it for everything from reminders for recurring household activities, to groceries, to work related to-do, never missed anything ever since I started using Todoist. Give it a try, you won't regret it!!",
Tries way too hard to push premium onto new users. I want to try it out first,
"I use it all day to help get things done.  Group all of your life's categories, prioritize your ""Must Dos!"" Go over your ""never dos"".  Great app for ""doers"" who get stuff done. Only annoying thing is for me it tries to put dates on tasks.  Not really into that whole date thing but maybe some live and die by it.",
"I've tried to-do apps across all platforms and with a whole load of approaches to organisation of tasks, but Todoist has been the one that's really stuck with me the easiest.",
I have used to do lists in the past but for some reason never found them as helpful as this. I can check my lists wherever I am and it's really easy to use. I got more done in my first week of using todoist than I had all year!,
helps me stay on top of tasks plus it synchs perfectly across multiple devices and online.. would def recomend to anyone,
I like that I can make a backlog of to do items sorted by project. Once a week I triage my backlog and schedule items to be done during the week. Would love Google assistant integration.,
"Does what it need some far, but I haven't tried any advanced features, if there are any.",
"Finally a to do list app that loves up to its own hype. Simple and clean, well designed for multiple devices, but also extremely functional. And I LOVE the Karma feature as a personal accountability tool.",
"I think that the Gmail integration with this app really makes it special. My inbox is tamed, I'm the Queen of the follow-up, and I also use ToDoist to plan my entire year. I recommend it all the time.",
"If like me, you have multiple tasks being added to your desk every hour, this is the app for you.",
It helps a lot to keep track of my to-dos and and don't lose time with a lot of unnecessary options.,
"Perfect app for college students! Please offer a student discount. Would be VERY appreciated. Please consider adding a calendar view widget. Seems like expensive but I can't live without it, primarily cos of smart input. :-(",
I love the user interface of the app. Looks like native android yet still distinctive. Works beautifully and I have everything I need (except reminders) in the free version itself. I would have paid 5-10 bucks but a recurring bill is too much for a freelancer like me!,
I don't have heavy demands but I feel I'm only scratching the surface of what's possible with this App. Does everything I need and more. Definitely worth a try.,
It has a lot of options ans it's easy to use but some basic features are locked behind the premium version.,
"At first I didn't like that it encourages assigning a date, but the date input is helping keep me on track. User friendly.",
Just rediscovered Todoist and was very pleasantly surprised that it has evolved to such an extend.  Easily the most intuitive do list app that I have tried so far.,
When trying to do multiple reoccurring tasks like when I have a task that repeats every Monday and Tuesday the latter day does not show  up under Today if today happens to be Tuesday.,
A key feature is the daily reminder of undone tasks. It makes me want to complete it,
"Not a minimalist app by any means, but not personalization porn either. Straightforward to get the job done.",
It is really a very helpful app to ensure that we don't miss any of our prefixed tasks.,
I've used a variety of productivity tools and task systems and Todoist is the first that has truly clicked with my brain. I have become markedly more productive for using it and I would encourage everyone to try it.,
I am just starting to use this ap but has been very helpful in organizing my busy schedule.,
"I LIVE for Todoist. My life would be a mess without it, and the fact that it syncs between my phone and chromebook is amazing.",
I really am enjoying the app. I really like Thet it reminds you that you have things on your list. I'm still exploring it....I also like that it connects to my gmail account.,
"Lots of features but intuitive to use, and most importantly it's great for tracking everything you need to do.",
I've been using this for years. Im able to organize projects the way I function. Not in one massive list.,
"The program is well built, but the lack of ability to create sub tasks cripples the app.",
Cloud-based task manager helps me track stuff to do from all my devices. Karma points and goal setting keeps it fun and keep me more productive.,
"Biggest problem with me is seeing my to do list and always pushing it off and saying later, the reminders each day of what's overdue helps keep it in my mind",
"I've bounced back and forth between organization apps, and I just love the way this splits things up into projects and daily tasks.",
"Every thing you need is there. Seamless sync. Same UI on all platforms. Good design, excellent execution.",
"Great app, I have been looking for an app that I can use to mark down class assignments coming up. Meetings and due dates. It's east to use and very effective",
This app is greate to help u get things done.  The days of pencile and paper are over. This app takes it to an all new level of getting things done.,
I use it all the time and manage my simple needs from the widget. The email reminders are great for pestering me to accomplish tasks of lesser importance that I keep putting off.,
"Subject says it all. Every time I think of something that would improve the experience, I realize they have already included it. Amazing tool!",
Best of the best. I'm actually really impressed. Works also on iOS (best it can) The widget is awesomesauce. I've tried dozens. Very happy with ToDoist and the only one I use. I'm a picky guy too.,
Great app for what I use it for. Only thing I'd like is to be able to go back and view completed tasks.,
"I have severe anxiety, and this app makes a world of difference for me. The feeling of ticking off what I've done makes me instantly relax",
"Spot on. Really useful and quick. No intricate, useless tools that you end up not using. Fast, easy and clear.",
One of the best todo-ish app you can find out there. You really should give it a try.,
Using a todo app or a system usually gets boring but this app does a great job to keep it enjoyable.,
"Honestly, if you are looking to do your tasks effectively, try this app.",
"I've been using todoist for years now, which is really good for me and a to-do list app. I have switched around for years looking for one that did what I wanted and todoist is by far the best I've ever used.",
I've switched to it when my Leadertask license has expired. This app is great. The only minor problem is sync with my office PC.,
"I like the integration with Amazon's Alexa, and I like the fact that it keeps track of recurring tasks.",
"Im so tempted to go pro, the app is  very useful for me! I like how easy it is to prioritize tasks and organize tasks by the date",
"Great app, you just need to find personal adjustments in order for it to be truly useful in systems like GTD.",
"You can link to Google+ with the paid version and share tasks, although I don't see the need.  Prepare for it to ask you constantly!  Really my only complaint.",
"Been looking for a nice , unintrusive  app for my day-to-day tasks and this is just it! This app make sure I'm in charge of each day even if i don't feel that way.",
Perfect for keeping track of the things you need to do. Especially when life is so hectic and busy. Thank you,
This app allows me to sing from the same hymnal. I have multiple  platforms due to me being a sub-contractor. I can always stay connected to my most important tool.,
I realize it's an app for to-do lists but I would love the ability to store individual notes as well (i.e. not as comments to existing to-do items),
"Todoist is great but misses some features for work usage like time estimates, easier time scheduling, contexts and such.",
This app is the best thing in the world. It reminds you if you don't get your work done and also helps you remember things💖,
I have a lot of things in my mind and this app helps me keep it organised.,
"Love the meaningless rewards, for some reason they work for me.",
I really enjoy using the app and the web based version. And the points you are awarded makes it fun. Would like to try the premium version for free on a trial period though.,
"Makes note keeping so easy, and swiping a task right to clear it when you finish it is so satisfying",
"Could benefit from a timing option for tasks, as long as it doesnt refuce the simplicity of the app",
"I'm trying to find an Android replacement for Things, by Cultured Code. The most important feature is having start dates (defer). Due dates are rarely useful.",
Great for setting goals and to organize your tasks into different categories. If I had OCD I believe I would have enjoyed it even more.,
"This has really helped me manage this semester. I have full time work, full time school in my senior year of college, my senior project, and a side project. This has been a big help for me.",
Quite a few different apps and Windows programs to maintain my to do list. Some are too simple and some are too complicated. This one is just right.,
I use to procrastinate a lot since I used this app I can organize my day better.,
"Been using Todoist for a couple months and I  love it! I'm able to stay ahead of my work with reminders  and the interface is easy to use. The free version is fine on its own, but I really like the paid features to create labels.",
"Use this to break down my task at work,  and love it. Makes keeping track of thinks much easier than with paper list.",
"My school has a applaction already installed on our chromebooks for tasks, but it never encourged me to complete tasks like todist did. The clean and simple inter-face makes it easy to add and remove a task which makes life much more easier.",
"A clean, simple To-Do List with the right functions to get tasks organised without overloading the interface. Tasks can be create and organized very quick.",
"Works well, haven't had any problems and I only use the free version",
There's a lot that can happen here. It feels like a basic to-do-list app but many more functions could be wisely put together for a enhanced productivity.,
This is much better than using post it notes all over my house! Recurring tasks are easy to set up which is what I really wanted from a todo app.,
I've been encountering a reoccurring issue where the Todoist Widget stops updating. It is very frustrating to have to change views or even remove/re-add the widget just to get it to resync.,
"Works on everything, the app is super intuitive and easy to use.   You'll wonder what you did before without it.",
"More intuitive and easier to use, it really ""gets out of your way"" and let's you just focus on being productive",
"I tried a few different todo style apps, and found Todoist to be the best blend of functional, easy to use and featureful. I liked it well enough to get a subscription which is a rarity for me.",
This is the best app I've found and it really helps to keep me on track especially with the recurring todos you can add.,
This app is really good in comparison to others. I just want to see flexibility where you can select the option to specify not just date but also time.,
I really like the ability to sync tasks. Being able to pull out my phone and quickly jot down ideas is really helpful.,
I have been looking for an app like this for years. It syncs perfectly across all devices and even the outlook plugin works great.,
"I was looking for a good task management app for years and this one finally seems to be the perfect one for me. It synces well between all my devices, it has very pleasant and straightforward user interface and enables subprojects and subtasks. I bought premium right away and the filters are awsome!",
Love the app. Even considered getting the paid version. The video is stupid though.,
"Usefully syncs live across many platforms and devices. Helps track tasks and is just 'always there' encouraging us to get the next job done.  It feels great to keep moving and progressing.   Also good for project planning, collaborating and scheduling in real time.",
Other list and task managers are cumbersome and slow compared to todoist. If you use a keyboard and spend some time learning how to use the todoist efficiently. It can be very fast and easy to use. Could not recommend more.,
"So far so good. However, I wish there was a way of seeing all completed tasks for all projects in one go. Apart from that I love it :)",
It helps me manage my list fast and so i can take action on what needs to be done faster.,
Upgraded our entire Office to Business version,
"Helps me keep track of all that needs done. A good methodology for using it is essential.  Tim Challies book ""Do more better"" had a workflow method for using Todoist that really worked for me.",
Things I have been meaning to do for a year now are getting done because of this app.,
It's good. It doesn't make me more organised but it tries hard,
"Love the way it integrates all my tasks. Very easy to keep track of my projects, or any task for that matter. The best feature for my use has been been labelling. It makes it easier to have an overview of separate tasks at a single place!",
"Clean interface, levels of tasks that aid project planning, can integrate with my calendar and email me reminders. Handy for tracking simple to dos like my shopping list for the next time I'm  in the drugstore, as well as more complex projects - and all on the phone already in my pocket.",
Excellent app for managing time. There is everything you need in there & also it supports all devices & is not buggy & has shortcuts & easy and intuitive & ...,
I just wish that tasks under projects would show up in home.,
Google Calendar will do most of this with less effort. Date font here is impossible to read if you have any visual difficulty.,
I embraced the Challis method of work organization. Todoist was his recommendation and it works every bit as well as expected.,
"Easy to use, links right into Google, Evernote, and outlook.  One click & I set up to do items.   Can also assign tasks to others.    I get to everything on multiple devices and it all syncs up seamlessly.      If you have a lot to do this is the app to get",
"Costs less than the price of 1 coffee a whole month. You cant complain about the price. For the help you get in organizing your life, it is worth it. Clean design but also powerful.",
"minimalism makes things easier. once u get used to todoist, things get simple",
"My favorite aspect of this app is that it allows you to set dates for your tasks just by typing it. For example, it reminds you weekly if you set a task to ""Do the laundry every Sunday"". Very helpful.",
It's organizing all my tasks and splitting them into categoties. Very nice app,
Simple design and very effective. Keeping track of everything just got a lot easier. Plus the karma points is dope :D I love it,
The free version provides a good list program. I wanted something that was simple to enter and recall. Works well.,
"Great app that helps me stay focused, on task, and get more done each week. A+",
I'm the type of person that can forget something with one movement in a different direction. This app reminds me every day of the things I wrote down that I didn't do. It's very helpful for a forgetful person! ♡,
I have been looking for a To-Do-List app that is intuitive and syncs across devices and platforms. I found Todoist to be just it. It's generously dynamic both in app solutions and email back-up services. And these are all FREE! I also found it's offer of a month free offer of premium upgrade solutions a much kind gesture to someone especially in Africa.,
"Not only am I reminded of what I need to get done, it actually is motivating to make sure I take care of tasks. I didn't think it would be, but I really do feel pressure to get them done!",
"Very nice app. Appreciated, If you could include backup feature to save/backup our notes directly into cloud storage...",
"If you want to get everything out of your head and into a trusted place, todoist is a great app for it. They've continually honed the software to be what I think is a great fit for my productivity process.",
I constantly have to write down things I need to do during the day and this app is wonderful. It's also great the sense of satisfaction when you complete your task and get to tick it off!!!,
"I like this app. It helps me stay on top of my tasks. However, I would appreciate it if you could automatically have all of your tasks in inbox in chronological order.",
I like this because it sits open in outlook. Easy to use. Easy to stay organized. Easy to add tasks using cell phone. Everything is synced flawlessly.,
"It is very simple and smart to-do app. The most valuable feature for me is the location based alert, don't forget the milk anymore!",
"Thx to the fact it works really seamlessly across platforms I'm able to jot down and track tasks to get done anytime and everywhere. Good work, Todoist!",
Todoist makes it easy to manage my work and personal plans easily.  And it is easy to do so at any level of detail.  Use it!,
This app is amazing. Love how simple and streamlined it is and cannot say enough how helpful it has been in managing my life better day by day. Highly recommend.,
Even without the premium buy there are still a lot of effective and productive features of the app. Will recommend it anytime.,
"I was looking for an app for keeping to do lists organized AND would allow me to sync between devices (iPad,  Android phone,  Windows laptop) and  could work offline. I've been working with this app for over a year. It's great.",
"Very useful.  My favorite to-do app that I have found so far.  Use it both for work and personal life. Even sprung for the premium version, although not necessary to do.",
I LIKE VERY MUCH GOOD OFFLINE APPS . OFFLINE APPS ARE VERY HELPFUL . BUT IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THIS APP ARE NOT FREE . BIG FILE SIZE .,
"Definitely helps with keeping track of tasks. I do wish on the free version, you could pull up the monthly calendar.",
"Wish it was possible to view completed task history, found a way for the Windows app but it was hard to find, should make it easier and also add the same function to the Android app.",
Tried many but this is the best. Just not sure how to change the time when the daily digest arrives every morning.,
"More than the organization, its the getting things done part which makes this app awesome.",
"I have always been a list kind of person, and I especially love scratching items off my list. This app helps me keep my list organized, and I can still scratch items off when done. So glad I learned about this app!",
- 1 star for making me feel bad for missing stuff.,
Although I wish It would send me remind notifications rather then having to open the app.otherwise great app,
"Having tried a few rival apps, todoist is far superior. Highly recommended for ease of use.",
"It's a fairly useful tasker app. However, it is simplistic (not many functions) and many parts are paywalled.",
"ToDoist is a powerful Task management tool. It's quite intuitive. However, don't expect to realize its full potential without investing some of your time to learn how it works.",
"I was having problems remebering all the things that I had to do. Not anymore! I've put Todoist widget across the whole screen which makes it super accessible. Highly recomended! Also, it syncs with the Todoist that I have on the desktop which is a huge plus.",
"Could do with an option to add a notification to check tasks, like it does with adding tasks (non-dismissable).",
Seems like a great app but premium price is far too high. A one off much lower price would probably be a lot more succesful,
"Amazing app, lots of free features and great design. (awful commercial though)",
It's really helpful in many ways but it will be more useful if there is one more option to be added   keep some objects without closing and copy it automatically to the next day,
"Lots of options, free version works great. Can have my personal and work lists, Share a shopping list with my boyfriend and share plans with my girlfriends! Love it! Could be very slightly more user friendly/practical in places but not a major fault at all!",
Automatically detects dates in the description.  Simple to push tasks to the next day. Gives nice email reminders.  I've only been using Todoist for a week but I'm surely gonna keep it up.,
Very easy to use - seamless across platforms! Cannot recommend it enough.,
"It does exactly what I need without fuss.  I like that I can use it through my cellphone, tablets, laptop,  and desktop and all of them are in sync.",
With all daily things going on this little app takes a lot questioning myself away.,
"it's a very good app, easy to use, design is simple which is good as it's not complicated. lag free, helps you to get your job done. awesome app!",
Really makes sure you get everything done. And you feel satisfied when you tick off your task and it disappers! Loveeee this app!!!,
"Looks great, but not useful in free plan. And it's very expensive.",
"A easy to do list that's got all the basic features, including sharing with others. Simple but powerful.",
"Functions seem pretty good, but I've noticed that the widget seems to be using my battery very quickly!",
I downloaded it but can't use it without signing up and logging in. I wanted an app not some kind of service.,
Not gonna pay so much just for only a few different feature. Uninstalled.,
I've been using this for about a year and it definitely helps me stay up to date with everything I need to do!,
I got spammed with emails eventhough my notifications are off. Annoying.,
Only had this app for a short period of time but it has already changed how I work in my career and personal life! Can't remember this time I was so active and got everything done on time!,
"Required, but expensive it is best buy all-time is",
"Me and Kristen use this stuff like mad, yo!",
Please add an all tasks view (even those without due dates),
"It suits my lifestyle... I've got my goals without any hard and fixed schedule. Just the way I like it. It's also very intuitive, and the fact that it's available on Linux and Firefox upgrades my 4 stars to 5.",
This app really helped me organize my work and personal tasks. It exactly meets my need for a do list that is easy to update and keep track of,
"Love the app, I also once used Any.do but this has more detail and project management tools, uses the GTD method of task management, and is available cross -platform (I use iOS, Android, macOS and Win 10, and everything syncs perfectly). I'm upgrading my rating to a '10'. Highly recommended.",
"Where has this been my whole life?   Totally hits the spot when it comes to getting on top of things. As I use it, I'm sure I'll come up against a few things. But, as a new user, I am way happy.",
"Sleek, reliable app, syncs seamlessly across many devices, very userfriendly, and lots of awesome features. I have used Todoist since 2013, and nowadays mostly use the app. Extremely useful tool, it is essential for me now",
See all you need to do with out feeling overwhelmed!,
"Easy to understand and use, though a proper walk through would be great. Helps increase productivity!",
It really is a middle of the road app.,
App looks fine but you can't add even reminders to your tasks in free version ...which is very very basic and important functionality  .....uninstalling it as there are others apps which let you do this,
"Awesome app, but I find having to pay for reminders a bit of a rip-off, hence 4 stars",
"A very easy to use interface combined with a robust set of tracking and measuring tools makes this the most useful productivity app I have downloaded. I love being able to use it across multiple devices and though I did ultimately spring for the premium subscription, the free subscription doesn't skimp on some of Todoist's best features. I have been using Todoist for over a month now and I still look forward to starting my day with this app.",
"Best to do app I hv came across till now.... Very easy to use, best Interface.... But no reminder option in free app makes it necessary for upgrade as any ""to do"" app is waste without reminder😥, Wanted to upgrade but it is extremely overpriced😥😭😭",
"I absolutely love this app! It gives you the ability to make a list of tasks, and you can swipe or check them off easily. So glad I found it!",
Pitty the full power comes so expensive for a private user,
I would like more features than in the free version but I'm not ready to update yet.,
"Gmail, Outlook. iPad and android phone all working great - between Todoist and Evernote I'm sorted!",
Simple straight forward list that reminds me of my daily task ..keeps me productive and focused ..thanking the team,
Easy to use to do list app. I'd like to see more integrations with other apps and IFTTT,
Some of the premier features really extend past a plain to do list. Would recommend.,
Was looking for an app to create to do lists an this fits the bill perfectly and can be installed on a range of devices including my Android Wear watch.,
"Great app, useful and neat but premium is too expensive imo.",
"A well polished app, easy to use and integrate. It needs free reminders though.",
Easy and useful ... I can list down everything on what am I suppose to do for the day. And I guess it'll help me to improve my time management :) THUMBS UP!,
Use it all time it's great when you have a lot on your mind and you don't want to forget.,
Does exactly what I need it to. Would be cool if I could set reminders without upgrading.,
"It's so wonderful apps, I really can easily manage my duties",
I love it.  Super easy to use. Just using free features for now and very happy with it.,
"It's a great way to keep plans, tasks, and just about anything in the forefront of your mind",
Has nice features but nesting of tasks is a pain on mobile version,
"Best app in its class. Kudos to the developer(s)! Very clean and professional look and feel. Also, awesome support.",
"All the flexibility I loved from the days of paper combined with perpetual task carrying and scheduling ability.  Love it!  Write books or just make grocery lists.  With the full version, you can delegate tasks to other ToDoist users (free version) and they can help you complete your (now their) tasks.  I've tried many productivity apps, but this one is the one I've used ever since I found it.  ToDoist!",
"Great app for organising myself, personally and for business / work. Bought the paid version. Recommended",
Very nice app helping me a lot. It has the features I have been looking for,
I usually use a todolist app for a day or 2 before I wish there were things it had.  I've been using this for a month and everything I wish others had this has!  User for life!,
Great app but I'd like to have an option to see the full month in calendar form,
"A simple, easy to use task manager. I use it to assign tasks & reminders to my kids.",
I'm so much more organized and productive thanks to Todoist,
"I'm using this to implement a version of ""the secret weapon"" but it can also be used to implement ""GTD"".",
"Just started using this app..easy to use, just what I was looking for.",
"Have tried many to do list apps, this is the best one in my opinion",
Keeps me on task with reminders and alerts. Can use seamlessly between laptop and phone.,
I was able to increase my productivity and find ways to assign tasks to others.,
Could u make it show some task on Google calendar? And make the comment show below the task without access in the comment icon.,
Still exploring the extent of its capabilities but I can see its efficiency.,
It syncs well and you can easily share lists and assign tasks.,
"I downloaded the app, added some tasks, wow what an easy app to use I like it. Okay I'll add some reminders. Oh you need premium for that. Ok, I don't mind paying $5, maybe $10 for this. Holy moly $45 a year! What a shame. I'm now going to uninstall and look for another app. Oh well.",
I have found it simple to use but it keeps .me focused and helps me prioritize tasks,
"Great app but when the date has past on whatever I made a point of putting in as a reminder, why is it still sending me emails!!!",
Love the Google integration and now works with Amazon Eco. Todoist Rocks!!,
Okay. Nothing unique compared to similar to do apps.,
"Wanted to try this out to see if it would meet my needs, but pretty much every option required upgrading to Premium. I need a task list that can reset the 'Done' status every morning, so I can check them off again the next day. Also, couldn't see a way to Copy/Paste the tasks. Was hopeful because of the Wearable feature...But I'll keep looking",
This app really keep me on my list of things to do,
I'm not paying for the privilege of using an alarm.,
Good but missing the feature of sequential task management,
This app does not do anything without the premium version.Even reminder for a task need premium version useless !!,
"Works great. Simple, yet flexible enough to work for many applications.",
The best thing about the app is having it on several different platforms.,
It will become easy as a planned schedule for a event or personal things,
Hard to need anything more!,
It's a very useful app! Keeps me organized,
There's a ton of functionality and flexibility in this app!  I love it.,
I love this app so much.  Perfect,

"I use every day,  everything I need from to do manager",
"As a person who can be absent model at times, this app helps me keep on track",

Like it alot. Find it helpful,
This app will make you one if you aren't already,
Best task management app I've ever used.,
Great app but the free version doesnt have an alarm or notification.,
"Its good , but it should be given with the check box for better looks",
Very unintuitive. Very complex for a simple need.,
It's a cool app but needs to have reminders on task bar,

Good app emails are kinda annoying though,
Todoist has really made a difference in my work habits and is amazingly powerful,

"Pretty much all the good stuff requires payment.  That's understandable, I just wish there was a way to disable those options.  I got this app because I have memory problems, and having to exit out of the buying options of a feature I forgot wasn't free gets quite annoying after the 300th time.",
This is the only to-do app that I've stuck with for any length of time. There's enough functionality in the free version to make me want to pay the upgrade just out of sheer appreciation. The ability to use the html version when at my desktop makes it seemless. I just wish the upgrade was a bit cheaper.,
I love this app. It's really simple to use and coordinate with my family. I'm only giving 3 Stars though because if I want more options I would have to pay for a renewing membership. If it was just a 1 time fee to unlock all the additional options I would pay it but I can't justify paying every year. Also there is no option to make a task renew everyday. Ex: unload dishwasher. I have to manually input it everyday into my family's chores list.,
"I like it. Interface, usefulness, etc. But... I believe you should be able to view your own history of tasks. After all, this is not an added value by the app. It's just the list of tasks you did. Other things I'm ok with being behind a pay wall, but not this one. Would probably rate 5 stars if such ""features"" would be available to everyone.",
"I tried a lot of todo list. Watodo!, mylifeorganized, ultimate todo, 2do. Although I need to pay yearly for this productivity is such a big thing that I took a one year experiment. Todoist can be so flexible for gtd folks, and you can practically take notes on this. The filters allow you to tag place, people, duration context well and custom filters enables u to create magic. Edit: they actually listen to good ideas.i suggested that the comment section can be expanded and they did it",
"Thought there was something better out there so deleted this app and tried numerous other ones-BIG mistake! Easy to use, very user friendly and above all... Very motivating. I especially like the little messages I get once all my tasks for the day are finished lol.  Love this app and I'm here to stay :-) Thank you app team for helping me keep my life on track 🤗",
The synchronization across different platforms is the best I've ever seen. Very powerful hidden features. The thing I would like to see most is to be able to quickly set location reminders with natural language processing like you can with dates.,
Gut renovation of a home on top of working full time and I needed some help keeping myself sane and organized.   I've never found anything that compared to the old Astrid since Y@hoo bought it and shut it down (had been sideloading the apk on two new phones until I couldn't spare the time to repeat ... I digress). This app rocks with multiple STABLE widgets on different screens for different projects and SUBTASKS multiple hierarchical levels! Great customer service too! Spin updates from suggestions quickly,
"Notifications don't work, presumably unless you pay for them which for me is the whole point of a to-do app and should be part of the basic functionality.",
"My favorite part about this app is the widget. I can quickly add and remove things from my list without having to go into multiple menus, and I don't have to be online like with other to-do list so I've seen",
Helpful but not appealing. Perhaps adding morivating phrases can help u reach your objectives.,
Ive used many many apps. This one gets repeating events properly abd is very easy to use. Love it.,
"This app is really useful, sometimes I wish some of the paid features were free, but they have to get their money some how",
"I use todoist for everything. Work and home. I use for grocery lists, appointments, Bill reminders, and the dogs' flea/tick and heartworm. At work I keep track of tasks that require followup and sharing tasks with coworkers.",
Easy to use in my Android phone while on the go and synced with my office laptop so I can keep track of what I have to do. Wonderful.,
Perfect app for my organizing needs. I set my default diary every day using Todoist. It's seamless and perfect.,
"I can use on my laptop and phone! Not sure if it's a glitch from my end.. but when I access my to do lists from different devices, my lists double up when I check them again. If that didn't happen, I'd go straight to a 5. Wonderful app overall.",
I use this in concert with my calendar and it works GREAT. I especially like getting emails each morning reminding me of what is due for the day.,
"switching between projects , filters and dates takes 2-3 Taps. it's disappointing after paying premium pleaseconsider making two separate drawers one for projects and another one for filters which include today and next week",
"Love this app. I tried so many of these and always found then either distracting or too cumbersome to use. Todoist, however, is perfect. Simple and easy to use, and powerful enough to keep you on track. I can't fault it at all.",
My favourite to do app. I've sworn by it for the past two year. It's helped me keep track of all my projects and day to day work,
It would be nice if you could actually unsubscribe from the email notifications and have it actually work. Other than that pretty much perfect.,
"This is a great app. As a mom of three, it makes my life a bit easier to sat the least. Lol",
I like it because of it's simplicity and we can add reminders quickly just by writing don't need to tap many things like date and time we can just write it,
Clean and simple interface. Email reminders. Keeps you moving forward with your tasks. 4 stars as expensive for the upgrade/professional version.,
"This app is very helpful,  intuitive and does exactly what I need it to do.  Definitely worth upgrading to pro.",
Each and i mean EACH function is usable only after paying. You can't put up a ducking alarm!!!! Pathetic,
Very useful app. It is it's simplicity that makes it a great app. The Karma feature keeps me motivated to add and complete daily tasks. I will really appreciate if you provide the basis of calculation of karma score.,
I really can't recommend Todoist enough for anyone trying to get organized and increase their productivity.,
"Really cool. Functionality and layout are both very nice. My one wish (so far) would be the ability to add a note as I'm creating a task. As it is, I have to go back to a created task to give it a note.",
"Notification system could be better, great application otherwise. Also outlook integration didn't work well.",
"I often feel like everywhere I look there's another deadline, and while that hasn't changed, this service has helped me immensely. It's exactly what I needed to keep up with it all.",
This app has made me so much more productive and has helped me prioritise and organise my work so much better.,
"Keep my life organized, so my mind can think about something else.",
DON'T GET THIS! Damn thing keeps spamming my email and there is no option to make it stop. Even if you delete the app.,
"I've used a few organization apps, and I am now dedicated to this app. It's minimal interface with powerful features is perfect. Don't overlook the every! command. Labels, tags, and projects create clean, effective organization. This is a fantastic app.",
"Nice integration with Evernote via  IFTTT. Accessible on multiple platforms, handy as a capture platform. Give it a shot.",
This app keeps me on tasks and allows me to make sure I get the work I need to do done. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a planner,
Too bad... The app's good but the free version is lacking,
I would like to be able to see the tasks that I've completed . It adds a sense  of accomplishment,
"Been using this app for almost a year, works great on all my devices.",
The material design amd animations on this app are on a whole other level. Works really well on iOS too. Amazing app! Keep up the good work,
"Multi-platform, structured but versatile.",
Great app that just works - I use it everyday!,
Despite this app's simplicity it surpasses many others.,
Love how fast I can put in my tasks. App works perfectly on my phone.,
Helps me make my day and achieve goals.,
Meilleure application dans le domaine ! Tres simple et pratique,
Love the fact that it reminds me everyday even though that specific task was overdue.,
"Great design, would like to see reminders without having to upgrade though.",
"Sends reminders when needed, and easily organizes everything you put in",
"Very wonderfull app.. some bugs into the UI... Need to add in my POV Time per task, and make pomodoro.. i am now make intergration between it and another app..",
I LIKE THE INTERFACE THE PRESENTATIon AND Design highly recommended,
I found the regular email notification particularly helpful,
Has excellent interface and reminder actions,
"But after syncing to and granting permissions for my Google account, none of my tasks or categories are there",
Useful. Keeps me on track,
"Easy to use.  Works on my laptop, tablet, and phone.",
"I tried A LOT of the todo options available at the moment, and todoist is, far & away, the best.  Simple, intuitive...device ubiquity...the ability to feed data in/out via zapier was the clincher.  Smart app by smart developers.",
I love how it's so easy to add a task. That's how you got me coming back. The ease to snooze and complete...... I'm sold. No app does it like todoist.  Plus your updates are genius.,
Does what I think says. Simple and quick.,
It is nice & simple app. Works on all platforms.,
Serves as a nice reminder,
Cross platform integration rocks,
Using the freemium model.,
It's fun and easy,
Bangin App!,
Keeps you focused and motivated,
Great way to keep organised,
Very useful,
Never miss a deadline.,
Essential.,
Very handy,
Easy to use,
Easy to use and clean,
Excellent app,
Keeping me organised,
Does its job well,
Use it every day,
So intuitive,
The best,
Great app,
Awesome product,

"Todoist combined with an online calendar is the perfect combination for me; if a professor sets a deadline at a specific time, I can enter that in Todoist and have it remind me, and I can type notes for tasks and attach things to them. Synchronization, even offline, just works. They have an app for just about every platform. They have automation capability with IFTTT. Worth every penny of the $30 subscription for pro.",
"Love this app especially the smart reading of typed text that sets dates, project names, etc. When using the widget to enter a new task although it seemingly recognizes the smart text entered it does not carry over to the actual app. Once this is fixed, 5 stars and will probably subscribe to premium.  Nice work todoist team.",
"The app works like I feel like it should. For example, you can create a project and assign tasks to it, and those tasks will show up on your ""to do"" list along with tasks that have no particular project. Basic stuff like that seems to be lacking in so many other products!",
"App just keeps getting better. A year ago there were a few things this app didn't do well, but most minor irritations have now been addressed. I don't buy may apps but this one is worth paying for.",
My life lives in todoist and I'm a massive fan but it appears with android 6.0 there are some battery issues. This swallows a quarter of my battery each day currently.. Please fix this soon so I can carry on enjoying it!,
"As a person with many voluntary roles, a full time college student and have many other commitments (orchestra rehearsals, work etc.) this is exactly what I needed to help me keep track of things I need to get done. Thanks to this app, I will never forget to attend another training session, another assignment I need to complete or even what I need to get from the shops. Love it!!",
"This is the one! I've pretty much tried every task manager that's been out there but this is by far the best thing out there. Here are the highlights: APP SUPPORT:  Todoist supports EVERYTHING. I have a Mac, a PC, an android phone and an iPad and there are apps for all of them. And in the end up mostly using the web app because it's so good.  EASE OF ADDING TODOS:  You can add todos from anywhere, hotkey from any app in mac, the notifications screen in android, typing q in the web app, forwarding an email.  NATURAL LANGUAGE DATES/PROJECTS:  Todoist is even better than RTM. You can type, ""Send weekly update every week on Friday #Work @office"" and it will create a todo recurring every Friday in your Work list tagged with ""office"". Other apps force you to go to menus, drag things to the list you want and all sorts of horribleness. (I'm looking at you Wunderlist)  ADVANCED FEATURES: Too many to name. My faves: Set a time on a todo and it texts you a reminder, Space for project notes, unlimited comments on todos, photos added to todos, custom filters (Like todos for all my work projects due today).  Stop looking. Just get this.",
Tasks are easy to create and I never have worry about something getting missed. I started using this for school and now it is the only task program I use for everything.,
"I'm a hyper organized person. I've tried MANY list apps and this is by far my favorite, I've been using it daily for over 6 months. It's key lists can be color coded, and can be promoted or demoted.  all tasks can be prioritized on a scale of four (High medium low none) so I can use the Eisenhower decision matrix ( Google it. Life changing ). And I love that you can type in the commands along with the task name and it's coded in - for which list, what priority, when it's due, and any tags. Just the best!",
"I have been using Android since it came out, and this is the first application I have reviewed.  It's that good.",
My #1 organizer app. I use it for everything. Nothing else helps me keep track of my life quite like it.,
Easy to use once you get the Todoist mind set. There are some more useful functions on the Premium version but i am not well enough into it yet to commit.,
"Paid features are always show in UI  not able to hide. Projects without description. If UI would be simplier as Google keep would be better. Fonts/ratio big, no compact view, widget no resizeble to two columns",
"I use Todoist daily to keep track of what I need to do, and what I've already accomplished. Karma is a fun way to help motivate...I don't actively work toward higher levels, but I do get a little thrill when the advancement notifications show up.",
User interface is not ideal but very complicated. There are too many steps involved with every task you wish to add. I wasted so much time trying to enter in tasks that it took away from the time I could actually accomplish them in.,
"Interface is easy to use, pretty customizable, and free of clutter. Also, can be used across devices, which has been super useful so far.",
I use Google Calendar. This app only syncs to Caleder once a day. Major problem as you can imagine. . Other than that it is a great program. No other issues. I have recommended this to my friends and family.,
"Todoist works well for me for reminders, shopping lists and to-do lists.  I love the integration with IFTTT.  I get pretty busy and the todoist widget on my phone helps me keep organized.",
"I have enjoyed using todoist for work, i find myself getting more done in a day, unfortunately the location based notifications are not working for me but hopefully that will be fixed soon        but overall i think its a great program and I'd recommend it",
"Its great. I got the paid version and if you stick to it then it will help you alot. Features are good, cross platform support is awesone.",
I am someone who genuinely forgets things. Todolist is like a true companion who keeps gently reminding. I really find the tool useful to keep me on track. I feel so much better when I finish the task and by swiping it off the to do list.,
I like that this app can make tasks as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. Simple to do list or multilevel projects are possible.,
I am obessed with this app. I'm a huge list maker but this let's me organize them and set priorities and reminders. Best app for the scheduling challenged,
Simple to use and as complex as it needs to be... Not to mention I love that it notifies me each morning that I have stuff to do on my list,
"Good app... 4 stars because wunder or trello do things for free that this one charges. But sometimes simple is better. I use trello for real work,  this for reminders",
"This is the best to do app I've tried. It's very user friendly, efficient and intuitive and actually helps me get stuff done!",
Very solid app and online  program. It helps me to get the cluttered thoughts and events from my brain to an organized and easily-accessible system that is user-friendly. I'm still learning the best ways to use it.,
"Literally used to be so disorganized but this app as well as the chrome extension for it have really helped me change. It relieves a lot of stress to be able to look in one place for all things school and work. Also, premium is seriously worth it.",
I find it very useful and helpful for school and else. The only thing i wish the app allowed me to do is to edit the project title. I have to do that off my desktop.,
Synch well across all platforms. Easy to use. Great productivity tool. A bit pricey.,
I'm trying to use this great app more to save my time and prevent to waste paper ad much as possible,
"I can keep all of my to-do lists in one place, including shopping lists. Simple, useful, rarely crashes. I couldn't ask for more.",
I like seeing the simple display of tasks i need to do in different categories such as Work or Shopping. So when i go to work i know all the tasks i need to finish there. Overall pretty helpful app.,
"I do enjoy having it, but there's definitely room for another app with an easier UI to be developed, but for now I can manage.",
This app has been a big time saver for me. It also allows me to clean up my calendar so if only shows appts and not all my daily tasks.,
Some of the to-do list apps out there are just too complicated you don't want to read them. Love the simplicity.,
Great App for a multi-taskers. Makes it easy to manage multiple tasks and keep track of long term projects. Especially love the automatic date and time detection.,
I've tried several but somehow managed to settle down with this app. It's robust and the team on it is very responsive.,
"I have finally found an app that I use daily for everything. I took a lot to quit using sticky notes, but this app did it.",
"I have tried many many productivity apps and by far this is the best; far as features, overall display and ease of use and the myriad of options. I would definitely recommend",
Great app! The only thing I'd like to have is the list of what is done (in a free version). Though I might just have not figure it out how to see it here.,
I don't forget things I want to do again. Desktop synch simply killed it for me and the offline feature that can be synced when you get online and synch to the desktop and across the devices! Thanks so much for giving this to the world!,
"I love that I get dailey emails telling me if I missed something. This is the best to do list app ever! It's simple, I get everything done with it.",
"Very direct with items, email reminders are a plus. I need to figure out how to move tasks to overdue to continuous",
"I love how it is everywhere I need it. On my phone, on the web, and as a browser extension. Whenever I need to remember what's next on my list, I can easily find it.",
I prepared a language exam recently. I found this App is so useful for me to calculate the process I was going on. I really like the feeling when I finished task,
Beautifully designed and usefully insistent. A great app. Too bad more useful features are in the premium version.,
I've been using this app for a week or so now and I already feel less stress and anxiety about my course load.  Really helps keep pace your day.,
The most flexible and feature rich to-do list. It works exactly how you want to with little opinion. Also the API is fantastic.,
I use this app to stay ahead of tasks and record notes I'll need to remember later. I love the full text search.,
Every I do something the update to premium keep popping up. I end up wasting time due to this.,
"This is a very useful list making app, reminders are good for me as I have a poor memory.",
Todoist works well for me. Those who complain about the premium cost clearly don't make significant use of task management software :),
It's amazing to let this app remember everything for me. So easy to use and I get things done!,
I like the simple interface of this app.  However having to buy the pro version to use certain important features such as the reminder was disappointing.  I am therefore deleting this app to find one that does not require me to pay for certain features.,
This app is fantastic and would really like to give it a five star rating. I would really like to see the app available for the Samsung Gear App Store so I can use it on my Samsung Gear Neo 2 smartwatch.,
With this version it feels like Todoist lost everything that makes it special. Old design was great. Now I just feel like using some unstable Google app...,
"Very slick, well presented and easy to use. My one gripe is that alarms aren't in the free version, which means I have a great list of tasks I can very easily forget to look at.",
Nothing too special but it works just fine both on my phone and on my PC browser.,
Todoist is an example on how to do simplicity the right way without loosing important features and keep a lean flow. Well done!,
"Seems to be really good. Losses one start since prohibitively expensive recurring annual subscription to get the features I need, especially if I'll get it for my whole team. Losses a second point for placing the paid options all over the app in a way that distracts productivity. Other apps to which I upgraded and have most of the features I need have a free version that is functional without distraction so I could use it and put it in my normal workflow before I upgrade, had an option for a non recurring one time price with a negligible annual fee for online sync which is understandable, and their one time price is less expensive than a one year subscription here. I understand these are different marketing strategies. I'll stick with the ones I use for the moment.",
"Just so persistent, I had to deal with my procrastination. Good one",
"Great app. Would love to see an added button to remove due dates without having to go into the task and clear out the date individually. This can be done on a computer, but not on the application. THANK YOU 😊",
This has made life so much easier for me! It's just so satisfying to swipe tasks as done! I would make recommendations though : 1) if certain tasks could be set to disappear after a certain amount of swipes_ saves on having to clutter the space with copies of that task e.g. eat multiple fruit for daily vitamin 2) if the tasks could be set to repeat on multiple week days e.g. violin practice every tuesday friday and sunday 3)  a vague suggestion of when to do the task e.g. morning afternoon evening night etc,
Gentle reminders that are editable and sortable. They sync between all my working and life contexts. It has really helped me to prioritize and relax from task to task.,
I really like Todoist for managing my tasks but I would really like a better Android wear app. As this will help me manage my tasks better. I need the ability to choose a list of tasks from my watch without having to send from my phone.,
"Great tool for all my tasks, one offs and regular routines.  Tags & Projects let me quickly find what I am looking for.  Customizable reminders are flexible and effective.",
Great flow. I would change a couple of things but it's just preference,
Busy working mum. Stops me forgetting things. Helps me cope.,
"It's definitely helped keep my assignments in order. After a week I'm still not sure how to navigate all its functions, but it's doing the job.",
Very easy to use and I like how you can separate the list into 'projects'. Keeps me so organized.,
"The app allows you to log in with your Google account, so I expected some synchronization with Google. I was wrong; it doesn't synchronize with Google Tasks or Google Inbox Reminders. It also subscribed me to 3 email newsletters without asking.",
This is a good app to keep myself organized with school. I love how it syncs across all my devices.,
"Use it as for reading lists. And for EVERYTHING I have to get done in a day, I think the discipline helps as much as the app, but this one is great",
Aug-2016: installed and began using. So far early September it's working well and supporting me instead of the other way around. I will update after I've had more experience with it.,
I really like how this app reminds you through email. It helps me remembered to look and check off items on my list!,
"Currently trying out the Premium features to see if its worth paying for, coming from Wunderlist. I do a lot of my task management before sleeping 8n preparation forbthe next day l, so would really like to see a night or dark theme to make it easier on the eyes.",
i think the headline said it all. combined it with david allen GTD,
Helps me keep appts and stay on top of things a little better. Nice tool,
Moved from omnifocus after I got tired of not having it on android. Not going back!,
I was looking for an app to where I can simply keep adding to the list of tasks that need to be done and the ones not completed could easily be pulled up. This app is exactly what I'm looking for.,
Very easy to use. Keeps me organized and makes sure I don't forget meetings or appointments.,
"Whenever I feel like I've forgotten to do something, I always check my Todoist! It keeps me productive.",
"Good interface. Good color scheme. Red is easy on the eyes. It works well, but I wish you didn't have to pay for reminders. I think that should be a base function. But I get it, ya gotta make money somehow, so no biggie. Otherwise a good app. Recommend.",
I tried a number of different task management apps but never found one as powerful as this one. Even better is the gamification elements which make it fun to get stuff done.,
Sleek and simple interface! Great productivity tool. Would love to have the feature of being able to add a recurring task.,
So much better than the built in tool I've been trying to use. Intuitive and powerful.,
"Even without premium you don't feel like you have to upgrade with all the options they provide. You can create separate projects for school, work, or just errands and it works perfectly!",
"I am a premium subscriber and boy howdy is it worthwhile. I like the features. Also it's great looking. Would be cool if you could pull the next action items from a hidden list once a task in a project is completed. Still very cool. Thanks, people.",
"Good app, but the pro is costly and the basic version is missing the reminder functionality, which is sort of the basic requirement for an 'reminder' application. Other than this, the application is great. I would recommend a basic notification/reminder functionality in the free version, which would be really helpful!",
"I would love to quick add task from Gmail or Inbox directly, since 40% of my task related to coming mails, or sending mail.",
"I'm loving the app, it really helps me keep track of my work and home life!",
Been using this app for years and it has secured it's place in my organizational tool kit,
I use it at work as my main to go to-do list. Gets the work done since I always have my browser open,
This app is the ideal productivity app. It provides a very effective way to track or projects and every day tasks. I use it every day and it has been a great companion to my memory.,
I was getting bored to make a to-do list on papers this app help me too and its too well useful for me and if u r thinking to download please download it fast because I hope it work for u guys also,
Greatest app. Don't know what I'd do without it. Deserves every star,
Great UI with all the useful options. It's made easy to track my tasks daily. Thank you.,
With todoist I am getting more things done per day than I did before. I can postpone some tasks to the next day easy and the karma thing is an incentive,
"Am using the free version, request if you can provide the add comment option in this version",
Not as good as Task Crunch on Windows Phone 📱 but still very good,
I wish I could have my wife be able to access some of my lists and edit them from her account and vice versa. Otherwise this is basically a virtual post it note,
Very easy to use tool that almost makes it fun to get things done!,
I use this app every single day. It keeps my course work organized and my apartment clean,
"Simple to get up and running, allows setting up tasks for next Monday, every second Friday etc. Really handy!",
"Let's you organize yourself, while being efficient and clutter free.",
"Best of it's type love how it syncs with my Note 7, iPad pro and MacBook.",
I love the swiping when you complete the task. Love this app!,
The best but still a lot of space for improvements. Pro version is recommended for pro managers,
"Tried different apps over years,  this one seems to stick and I am actually using it :)",
This is the only checklist app i have used consistently. I actually enjoy it!,
Great app. It takes a little time to learn to use it. But be patient and consistent with it. It's worth the effort.,
Todoist is simple and easy to use. It makes it easy to create simple to do lists access able across your devices.,
Costs way to much for something that just reminds me to do things,
"Very useful for my bad memory,  easy to add jobs remonders",
"What good is a to do  list app without reminders, to get them costs so this is not a free app! I kept it for 15 minutes before uninstalling!",
I've been searching for this for a long time. Glad I finally found it.,
I love using this app. It's easy and good options to stay organized,
Design is great! Premium upgrade is a bit expensive. I would purchase it for 10€. Perhaps a three tier subcription model would be better...I don't need all the stuff Premium offers.,
"Great for creating tasks and goals, but could use better calender function",
I dont like emails but other things are markable,
Keeps a nice list. Wish it had a recurring feature.,
It takes care of all the stuff I need. Plus,
No app I guess can beat the complexity and awesome features of this app :),
"Does what I need, no significant bugs, easy to use, no nags to upgrade. Couldn't ask for more!",
I love the procrastination feature.,
The app is easy to use and navigate.  I like the reminder feature which comes automatically when you type every x day and the motivation to keep moving by getting karma points,
Works perfectly! Highly recommended if you seek to stay ahead of your busy day.,
I'm a GTD'R. Thus app does what I need to do beautifully. Highly recommend,
Incomplete without premium version. :),
I love it!  My only suggestion would be to be able to integrate with Google calendar.,
I love this app. It works on all my devices. Keeps me on track!,
"Great for creating different project lists, and monitoring success.",
Don't Know What I'd Do Without It,
"Happy with the app. Can help you organize your day, week, month.",
This app is completely amazing - helping me to catch up after getting way behind in my college classes!!!!,
This is a must app for every guy who tends to forget very simple yet important tasks.Kudos to the makers!,
Why does a to do list require access to my email account? Why does it want to read my text messages and know who I've called recently? Why does it need to be able to activate my microphone at any time?? I just want to make a damn list!,
They sent a lot of emails reminding you of your tasks.,
Love it. By far the best todolist app I have used.,
Already can't manage without it - brilliant!,
It has these three strong marks of a good tool.,
It keeps me updated with my scheduled task and be productive.,
Does everything you expect from a task manager and more.  Recommend highly!,
This app has too much access to other  information on the cell phone. Is it safe to use this app?.  How safe is my other data on the phone. Does it ready my passwords for other sites? 9/15/2016 Update: Thanks for the feedback.  Updated ratings.,
"The best multiplatform.  I use it on android, iOS, Mac OS, win, Outlook and Chrome",
I'd love more keyboard shortcuts in the web version.,
Does all the things it needs to efficiently,
"Easy to use, but effective in keeping me organized",
it would be better if we can add a task through the widget.,
Very practicle and useful app. Managing tasks are quick and easy,
Excellent user interface. Easy to use and utilize on a regular basis. Works well for GTD and ZTD.,
Simple and easy. Straightforward. Made my life so much easier,
It's a simple smart app for someone who has to multitask and work on multiple projects,
"Really productive app, helps me organize my day and keep on track",
Easy as a list with great organizing features. Love that it syncs across devices.,
Make it better by adding visual goal tracking feature!,
Todoist's framework is very well designed for task management,
"It's alright, just not for me. I prefer Manage It app. More down to earth.",
This has helped me out a lot I tend to forget a lot at work and with this I can just look at the app and remember everything I have to do that day,
The best i have used so far,

As a megayacht captain on multiple vessels i find this app indespensable!!,

"Já tinha tentado várias opçōes. Como o Todoist é muito simples e minimalista, nele só permanencem as funções realmente importantes e isso é fantástico. Depois de passar por mais de 10 apps pra me ajudar com a produtividade, acho que eu finalmente encontrei.",
👌👌👌,
"It syncs very well between multiple devices, is doddle to use and has a very clean interface. The premium version isn't the cheapest, but is worth the cost in my view and I especially like the ability to attach files to tasks. I would love to be able to attach notes from Evernote, there are workarounds but that feature would be the icing on the cake.",
"I was so happy to find this app.  Since I gave up my Franklin Planner for electronic media years ago, I have really struggled to find a system that was as integrated and holistic as the FP.  I like Todoist because it syncs across both Windows 10 and Android.  That is important.  There is an Outlook extension that becomes an integral part of my desktop Outlook app.  That is super important.  Even the Web app is great.  It all just works. Beautifully.",
It helps me stay up-to date with all my things to do. Love the easy user friendly UI and also the reminders.  I can easily divide stuff into various projects and keep track of them.  Would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to stay on top of their daily activities,
"I can never seem to get my thoughts together and I always forget what I need to do. To-doist takes care of that for me. Unlike other to-do apps I've tried, To-doist also makes the initiative of providing orginizariom of my thoughts and tasks as well as writing them down. Even if I don't have premium service, it still works rather efficiently",
"I was very keen to try this service now that it has arrived on android. And while the app is very well designed, a premium subscription is essentially needed for full functionality, and this does not come cheap. This, combined with the lack of any widget or cross- app sharing, makes this product nothing but a decent starting point.",
"Clean design, easy to use, convenient across platforms (web, Android, Mac, Windows, etc).  I love the prioritization feature and the non complicated design.  I also enjoy literally swiping items off my list rather than clicking a box that checks them off. It's a rewarding feeling when the item is completed. Great job.",
"Tested the free Todoist a few times before, but never found it intuitive, nor did I like the design, plus it's expensive. Now I tested the premium version to see if things are better there. Notifications for the newly created tasks stopped after a day. I realised that I couldn't remember whether the date I set was the due date or the reminder date. To test it, I tried to create a task without a due date, but with daily notifications. I couldn't and it wasn't clear either whether the task was created at all.",
"There are a number of things that I love about this app; natural language input, colour coding projects, nested projects, nested tasks, repeating tasks, comments on projects and tasks, beautifully clean interface that's as colourful or dull as you like, cross-platform support. The only thing lacking is the Wear app. Still, worth the sub if you want to go pro.",
App is very helpful in a time crushed world. The lists and reminders have helped keep the daily  schedule on track and ensures that tasks are actions consistently. The other curious result is that I have put away all the diaries and calenders and work lists that I have usually carried with me as the app allows her to cover all those tools.,
"I tried this out just because I could link it to my Amazon Echo todo list via IFTTT.  It has very quickly become my primary todo list for work and home. Easy to use interface, works on every device, plus I can easily share projects and tasks with my wife to keep household activities flowing smoothly. Only negative is the price is a little steep for the premium version considering all the other free apps out there.",
I am by no means a power user if this tool yet but so far it has been very effective without fail. I wish it would integrate with Google calendar. Also would like the ability for other co workers to login or create administrative rolls for my executive administrator. So far I like this app and will be using it as a go to tool. Give it a try you can't go wrong.,
"It would be great to be able to click a task that was added from an email in Gmail and have it open the email in the Gmail app, or at least open up correctly via Chrome. Instead it tries to open in Chrome but says, ""Temporary Error (404) We’re sorry, but your Gmail account is temporarily unavailable."" Everything else is great though.",
"I've been using todoist for 1 year+. I am in nursing school and have two jobs. My wife lives 100 miles away. Busy is the word. Todoist is great because relying on short term memory is a bad decision. It helps me kill procrastination. It is easy to use. It sends me an email every morning and it's usually the first thing I look at. Thanks, todoist.",
"It's quick, easy and intuitive to use, it really works and it has Android Wear support. Everything I want and need in one package but $44.99 per year is just too expensive for the features I need (I only really need one or two or the premium features). Please Todoist folks, consider an in between paid plan for personal users - say AU$20 per year.",
"Seriously, I love checklists, cause I'm really good at forgetting things, but having this portable to do list has been a life saver. I'm one of those people with a super busy schedule and no mind to remember, this app helps me organize everything. I have not been late to any events or forgotten anything at the grocery store etc. since I downloaded it, 10/10 would use again! (or in this case 5/5)",
"Such a brilliant tool when it comes to daily productivity. I now get things done and I don't forget anything with the nice notifications. Its simple and clear to use with a great user interface. The ability to set your daily, weekly or even project tasks or lists is great. Its certainly changed how I live on a daily basis and now I wonder how someone can live without it. It makes a grand difference to jotting down on paper, notepad or worse keeping it all on your mind.",
"Tried it for over a year but the lack of a calendar view makes it very hard to manage tasks. Devs refuse to consider adding it, even after multiple customers ask for it in their forums. Using Ticktick now which has pretty much all Todoist features + calendar view and its cheaper.",
"Really great app, love the karma and statistics; the sharing and setting number of goals per day/week. -- most functions however require a premium which I think is a little high for this sort of software. A one off price would be better, or lower the subscription fee. -- I do like the absence of adds in the free version :)  definitely an app I'll keep using for my weekly tasks.",
"Todoist is everything you need from a to do application. The natural language parsing means you don't need to learn how to schedule things, etc. and allows you to add tasks very quickly. This combined with a stunning, intuitive interface and cross-platform availability and you have everything you could ever want from a productivity app",
It meets all I wanted from Any.Do and Keep combined! (Specifically the ability to collect all tasks and quickly draft out today's plan in chronological order) Not to say better than those that I gave up like Wunderlist. Cannot replace Google calendar yet as it does not support start time + end time. Don't assist long-term planning also.,
This is very helpful for assigning tasks in a small group like a family or small business. Entry is a little time consuming and it isn't as intuitive as I hoped but it's good. I've found most every feature I looked for so far and i would definitely recommend this app.,
"The software does what it promises to do, nothing more, nothing less (it is a welcome change from some of the over-promised apps I have downloaded) ... It performs smoothly, does not get in the way, does not seem to consume phone resource and syncs nicely with the free Chrome add on... Enjoying it.",
"I love this app!  It is so great for keeping all the things I need to do organized and easily visible on my phone.  It has a great widget for my home screen, and I can pick how big it is.  It's so easy to add my own projects and different tasks within.  My only complaint so far is that if I accidentally mark something as complete, I can't undo it.  Fix this, and it would be 5 stars!",
I love this app! I keep track of work tasks and personal tasks. Everything I need to remember is easily jotted down to free my mind for other things. I even be keep my grocery list and songs to download here. I can view completed tasks to help with monthly and annual  performance reviews. Easy to categorize and prioritize.,
"Can't complain, like how easy it understands due dates. Would like to created linked items this then that, then that.. So I can create a sequence of tasks that only show up 'today' once the previous task is complete",
"Works across platforms so you can access it easily from your phone,  tablet, home or work PC. I find the options to label and group tasks really useful, like a cut down MS Project. If you like lists and getting things done,  this app is for you.",
"If it weren't for the limitations of the free version, this would have been my primary to-do app. In short, this app has managed to keep UI and functionality balanced without compromising on either - something the  Wunderlist app has not managed to do in my opinion.   NOTE (to Devs): The already available options for start page are quite good. I felt that one more option to display all projects could have been added.",
All my excuses for being unorganized or forgetting things have been totally blown away by this very handy application. What really blows me away is being able to link in other people into a shared project. Business and personal activities can be controlled all in one place and easily separated.,
"I do tomatoes, follow GTD and keep inbox zero and totally digital calendars. For a long time teux deux did the trick for me--no frills, simple daily lists. But my husband and I wanted to share grocery lists, and lists of fun things to do. Google docs and evernotr felt like overkill for such a simple task. I noticed todoist was integrated with IFTTT so I tried it out, and we've both been hooked for a year. Win!",
Now I can be sure that I don't drop balls. This program is easy to use and integrates seamlessly across platforms.,
"When compared to others, Todoist is the easiest to use. It is straight forward, you don't need tutorials or watch videos to learn how to use it. My favorite feature is the ability to set up Reminders for each task.",
"I downloaded this app with high hopes. I decided to try it out like you do with any new app. I went into ""shopping"" and I added ""buy milk"". So it added ""buy milk"" to the list. I then tapped the reminder icon and was immediately asked to upgrade to premium for $28.99 for 1 year. Seriously? I can't even do simple reminders without paying? Why is this listed under free? It's really not. Needless to say it will be deleted.",
Pretty good app. Problems withsync. On PC all dates are good but on Android they show as +1 day. Every today task on PC appears as task for tomorrow on Android.,
"Sometimes we need too fix a time for things to get done, so ready entering of date and time is a plus for me.",
"Great app I have been using for less than a week and it's changing my life. I am getting so much done! It's just a shame so much functionality is lost behind a pay wall, I just don't have that kind of money as a student.",
"The UI to choose a date for a task does not seem to allow choosing a month different from the current one. Also, I can't seem to find a way to submit feedback from within the app. So I had to do it here.",
"Just wanted something simple to keep on top of things and this fulfills that need. Only suggestion is that instead of just check marks to show a task is complete, I would like to see something to indicate that a task, though not complete, is in the process.",
"Very good app and happy with it. I wish the scheduling of different day and time was more intuitive, but it is fine once you get the hang of it.",
"Very useful if you want a simple task organizer. Love the ability to throw it on a screen as a widget. Have to pay to unlock many features, but for what I get out of the free version it is plenty for me.",
"Spams you with emails and doesn't let you set a to-do with no specific date. EDIT: Can be changed in settings it turns out, thanks devs",
"The app will not make you more productive, only you can do that, but todoist is great for organizing yourself and keeping track of your pending items as well as keeping them up to date across platforms.",
"Very good app, lots of devices, missing sorting options for tasks and home page (sort by date then by priority for example). Would consider premium by a bit expensive",
"My work load has been ever increasing and having to manage and follow up delegated tasks had started to become quite messy. I tried the free version and upgraded in less than 24hrs. It's been a great way to keep on top of different projects and stopping things slip through the cracks. Definitely recommend it, good bang for your buck.",
It allows you to build lists and projects with no fluff but it's not boring. It also rewards you for completing tasks. Which is cool.,
A must have app for managing your day..easy to use and loaded with functionality and available on many platforms.,
I never review apps but this one deserves it. The design really is distraction free and it is easy to form a habit of using it. Amazing.,
"Great app. Very simple UI. The date recognition in the tasks is perfect. The windows and browser based apps are just as good, if not better. Now I just need to get my company to pay for premium...",
"I liked this app but suddenly, I can't log in with Google. It keeps saying ""there's an error occurred please try again later."" And it's been 3 days from now.",
Great app and would highly recommend upgrading. Takes getting things done with to do lists to a whole new level,
"This app works really well. It allows tasks to be grouped and organized in various ways, but is also easy to use.",
I like the program and I think it is helping me to stop procrastinating and get things done!   The karma could be a little better if the points were based on how many tasks were added and completed undated of just a number for tasks being completed or added during the time between checks. I would also like to see a timer within the program and the addition of karma points for close estimates on the time to actually complete the task versus the estimated time. The sync across platforms works wonderfully!,
"Most of it is OK but the Android home screen widget is butt ugly and wastes screen real estate. Only two (2) items are visible in a 2x3 widget! I have pixels, I want to use them!",
"I'm still a relative Newbie but the program works better every day. Most of the issues I encounter are probably Operator Error. There could, perhaps, be better integration with other programs BUT they seem to be working on that constantly!",
They send me emails several times a day. If any of my to-do items reference a day or date it comes back as a text message to me which I guess is okay for some people but I'd really like to be able to turn that off. I just want a to-do list that synchronizes over all of my devices which this app does without all the spam. I would like them to add the ability to dumb to the app down.  I get the feeling that they would like their users to be a group of people collaborating on some project.,
I have been looking for a complimentary online task manager for a while. This one is closest to my ideal so far.,
"Im really enjoying the app, its easy to use, straight to the point and it helps me to remember all those small but big things.",
"Runs well, I especially like the multiple subtask option. The widget could use a way to open the application for editing ""parents"", though. I get the no notifications unless you pay, too, but it still kinda sucks a little.",
"I'm a very unorganized person, but it helps me see everything I need to get done and do it",
I've adopted ToDoist to help me manage actions across all of my stores. This is a great communication tool.,
Great app reminds me all the time. My problem is my own discipline.,
"Adding new task window objects are huge! and it's not easy to interact on Nexus 6. Requires more UX for new task window; make fields and titles more minimized in two column. AND ALSO PLEASE have a look to Android N, Widget is not stable.",
"This is my go-to place for every task, both business and personal. I have used Wunderlist and Asana extensively previously and this seems to be the best tool for my situation.",
"This is the best Todo list and planner I have ever seen. Clean, usable interface, coordination through all devices.",
"Todoist is an integral part of my life.  Use it every day, couldn't get by without it. Helps keep me focused and motivated.",
"When I first started with todoist I wasn't getting the most out of it. I watched a series of YouTube videos and learned a lot. Now I know how, I am so much more organized.",
Liking it more and more as I get used to using it. As I make it a habit to use.,
"App asks for upgrading it but according to me, you should provide more features in free version such as reminder. Thanks",
"Functional and minimalist UI, ease of access on multiple devices. Auto converts your time/date text input to one that the the system recognises and remembers it.",
"I love this app, it is good for work and home. I can add to the list so easily in the middle of the night when I think of something. Everyone should use this.",
"This app,  and it's numericaly conceptualized productivity 'Karma,' has helped me quantify what I have accomplished. It leaves me seeking new things to do!",
"At first it was a novelty, now it's essential that I put all my stuff to do in Todoist or it don't get done.",
I plan on buying the full version. So far it is great for tasks. Though I would like to see calendar ability for 'repeat' tasks.,
Nothing is intuitive about this app. I still can't figure out how to add more than one task to a day. Not to mention you have to type out the day you want to add the task to. Not user friendly at all.,
Just don't put every little thing on your todo list or you'll start ignoring the notifications!,
I'm using this one to keep track of all the little things and it's doing a great job.,
"Some other apps I've tried either don't have a desktop option that syncs to my phone, or is too complicated to add the projects and labels that I really want. This app makes it easy for me to categorize my info while still having quick access to it all. ☺",
When you dont want to keep everything just in your mind or write lot of drafts on papers that can be easily lost...its a great opportunity...just a pity that notes and reminders are only premium :),
"I've tried a lot of productivity methods and apps but this is the one. Todoist premium is intuitive, easy to use and so effective in its simplicity. I love it. I felt like I was drowning before being so overextended and now I'm still overextended but I feel much more in control.",
"This is an excellent app for saving time, organizing, and not missing any appointments or important calls. A definite benefit to productivity!",
"This app is super easy to manage and navigate through, I'm super busy so I needed something like this to keep me in order",
"my only complaint with this is having to specify the parent of a task every time, which makes it annoying to make long lists",
"Cant set recurring event start time, really not convenient to type recurrings, Id better pick some",
I use this all the time for reminders and lists - it's like a replacement memory.,
The app doesn't let me forget about things that I enter. It holds me accountable for the things I say I need to do,
This app changed the way I organise my life and has made me far more productive. I have never paid for an app before but I thought todoist was well worth it. Truly fantastic.,
I am always mentioning things that I need or need to do and forgetting them shortly after. Now I put it in the list and the reminders won't let me forget!,
"It's everywhere you need it to be.  Phone,  browser extension, website etc. Powerful filters allows you to use any time management system that works for you.  Integration with toggl for time management is great.",
"This is the perfect app if you are scatter brained like me! Easy to use, perfect to keep track of all the little things.",
I've been using Todoist for almost a year and have become obsessed. Watch videos on YouTube for tips. Read Getting Things Done by David Allen to really unlock the power of this app!,
"After using several to-do apps, I stay with the todoist and paid for the premium version. So far so good, but could be better adding features like showing tasks due today in Notifications bar, also with quick access with it, therefore can add a task with speed.",
A simple to use way to keep track of all the things you need to do. Easy to set up and you can get as complicated as you wish with powerful features.,
You can know what you have to do every day of the week. It's easy to add a task and to edit it.,
"I thought it would notify me when I set reminders but apparently it doesnt.  After an entire day with their support, I finally figured it out.",
Nice software with good features. Still needs a little work with hierarchical tasks but it's the best software I found.,
I open it and the way it tries to make me schedule things just feels so stupid,
"Finding this to be one of the best ways to get my life and keep it organised. Also finding helpful in pushing me to complete my tasks and tracking my productivity, which is great for a chronic procrastinator such as myself",
Great to do list management and the filter tagging makes following different productivity systems (eg GTD) easier,
"Easy to use, clean design, I definitely recommend this for people who don't have great calendars like myself.",
"After near 5 years using Google Tasks quite intensively daily I migrated to Todoist. And it's 1000 times more functional. I enjoyed it a lot. Using now on Android phone, iPad, Mac and Web. And even it's integrated in Calendar feeds on my devices. Love it",
"I have tried many 2do apps but this one meets my needs the best at this moment. Simple, easy to use, synchronized to all of my devices.",
"Works flawlessly between my laptop and phone. Free version is good quality, paid is excellent upgrade for all features. 5 stars strongly earned.",
Better than any other organization app I've found for free I give it 6/5 or 110%,
This elegant software allows me to keep my focus on the real challenge: the transformation of my own thinking and behavior.,
"But charging a subscription fee for premium services instead of just a 1 off payment is just greedy in my opinion, I'd happily pay money for premium, but not year after year after year for it.",
Its very simple to use and provides a simple user interface to organise ur task and prioritize them in addition to placing  them in subfolders and etc. A great app to get organised.,
Helped me get on top of many lists and can also share items with my husband. Awesome!,
"It's a good app, but I hate that they hacked off part of it and are trying to ransom it back to me.",
Like it just wish there was more attention payed to the projects area. Where you can see all on one page under headings. Also project tasks should show up on 7 day page under sub heading of that particular project. Other than that pretty okay app.,
Best ive tried really easy to keep using and share. Its over a year later since i got the app. I am still using it. This app is not a fad. Its a must for people that want to be organized in an easy to use way,
"I love this app to the core. Its interface makes it quite easy to use. Natural language interpretation of date and time is a BIG plus. However, I kinda find the free edition too limited. Features like reminders are more appropriate for the free edition.",
"Todoist helps me remember, prioritize and accomplish tasks for the Lord. It is a real blessing. Thank you developers!",
"整体不错；有些细节方面的方便程度还有待提高。  todoist particularly attractive to me is this:  ①Karma scores, this is great  ②Web and my mobile synchronization very fast, almost real-time synchronization  ③The operation is relatively simple",
"Incredibly useful, especially once you post the large widget to your second home screen rotation. Easy to build and schedule tasks with their quick add function. Also REALLY like the keyword association with temporal stuff, ie, I can type in pick up clothes on Friday, and it will place 'pick up clothes' on my Friday to do",
"Great free tier, and lots of premium features if I needed them. Would be nice to be able to change task categories by dragging them into topics.",
I am so glad I found this app. I have been using it for awhile and I really enjoy the ease of use and what it helps me do. I can set tasks quick and easy and it is easy to see what you still have to do,
But very big layout. I can see only 8 items in list on my Samsung note 5.,
"Its all KISSed up. Simple, but still can be as complex as you need it to be.",
"It's quick and easy, though the paid version is lacking.  I was hoping for a bit more project oriented subfields.",
This is a great to do app.  One thing I hope they make easier is the ability to make a quick and simple checklist like in Google Keep.,
"I like todoist because it streamlines all of the things I disliked about other to do list. It makes it more intuitive to say let me add this to my to do list than to say I'll remember, which is really good.",
"It's a great app! I like it because it's simple, beautiful and works great with my GTD system. I started with the free version and a day later I was convinced the premium version was totally worth it.",
I just need to figure out how to store things for incubation or reference,
i need some today apps . i used this app as this is the editor choice but after installation slide open showing its feature and when i slide to the last screen shot ... its stuck to blank rer page... no room to go... fix it,
"It helps me keep up with what I do each day. Very easy to use. I'm sure there are more features they could add, though.",
I've tryed pretty much all of the todo apps on the market and this is simply the best. Also it's propably the cheapest too.,
Keeping me organized. Lil struggle on shifting project stuff though. Otherwise good.,
Good UI & flexible app. I bought the year membership to unlock features that were not available in free version. Happy with purchase.,
"As a optional function, include task start time and end time as it depends on personal choice whether to keep a track or not",
"I am currently using the paid version. I find this tool indispensable in helping me keep myself organized. It is user-friendly, almost intuitive. It helps organize my tasks. I love the way that it works with other apps such as ITTT and Outlook and Google Calendar.",
"This helps me self manage. It is as useful a tool as the operator. When I behave, it helps me notice and effectively delegate.",
"I am able to manage my outings , events and activities easily without forgetting anything and now I don't have to tell my friend or family that I need to check the calendar , I will tell them let me mark you on To Do List , if there's a spare space , I hope this app keeps progressing and getting better",
I love this app! It keeps me focused on all the things I need to get done and I feel so accomplished when I say it's completed!,
Most of the paid functionality of this app can be utilized for free by others. Setting a time of a to do is a general function of almost all the others. I have uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times hoping this app would adapt to competition and I'm always disappointed.,
This app is very easy to use and still works very well. I can enter all my tasks professional and personal and always have them with me on my phone wherever I am.,
Pretty nice app. Convenient like how it picks up and simply organizes.  Wish it would have a repeat task daily etc option.,
"Easy to use this app, it is very straight forward and simple to understand. I love using it at work and at home to remember the little chores and paired with a timer it has helped my time efficiency. I also use google calander for my reminders and a pomodoro timer to do work in manageable time frames!",
Have thoroughly enjoyed the app for the past week I have used it. Considering getting the paid version in the future.,
"Simply the best task manager out there. I've used it for years and it keeps me, my business leaders, my nonprofit boards and my twins organized. Whew!",
"PC or phone, great app to track things that need done.",
"By far the best taak mamagement system going. Simple, easy, effective and not payment required to enjoy it",
"I've tried many tools. Todist provides every feature of any tool I've seen, with a flexible ability to choose the amount of detail or structure you need, on a case by case basis.",
Very helpful for someone like me who forgets alot. This app is simple and easy to use,
It would even cooler if you guys could add an option to adjust widget transparency. Thanks.,
"I love Todoist because every day it's incredibly simple to focus on my next due tasks and if I have time after that I'll dive in deeper based on a tag like @marketing or @research. Collaboration is easy, and projects or one-off tasks fit seamlessly into the user experience.",
"Everything else is OK, but lacks customization options.",
I have tried many todo apps supporting the gtd concept.  This app is IT. No need to go anywhere else. Loving the entire Pc Android and add-ins ecosystem.,
"The app is very good and full featured, but only if you buy a premium account which is very expensive. Without one it is fairly basic.",
Has been a great help in project management! Easy to allocate tasks and view progress.,
This tool is great to keep track of your pending tasks. Very easy to use and have multiple options for different platforms. This helps to update your progress at any place you are.,
But would love to have a way of pinning it to the status bar to let me know I have stuff to do.,
Makes work and life easier. I don't have to worry about forgetting something as todoist keeps track of it all.,
Easy to use with a clean interface. Very helpful keeping track of tasks. Still dislike subscription model.,
"This app works great for keeping track of projects and appointments but, I would enjoy it more if it did my chores for me ;)",
"I recently moved from Any.DO to Todoist and I don't regret my decision one bit. It is so much more detailed, customisable and encourages you to be productive. I also like the new Material UI",
"I own a couple of businesses that are unrelated and keeping up with my day to day ""to do"" list is beyond ridiculous.   This app is saving me a TON of Sticky Notes!",
I like to use text to talk and it's like having my own personal assistant to set up my calendar,
Got this to help me with GTD. Will give a more complete review when I've used it longer.,
"I could not be happier with Todoist and the positive changes it has helped me make in my life when it comes to remembering and planning, from one-offs to large scale projects.",
"definitely the best todo list app, can quickly assign a date/priority/folder for the task and easy to change afterwards e.g postpone to next week. Can sort tasks by priority/date etc and has a good web interface which syncs with the phone. Does everything I need and some great features I hadn't thought of. Free version does everything apart from adding notes and labels to tasks but I don't need that",
"Love. Love. Love it!! Robust and affordable. Only thing I really wish I could do is event hourly duration for my calendaring. But, with all I benefit from, I can wait until they figure it out.",
Would like to have a calender instead of a to do list for the next seven days. Other than that great app!,
"I have been using Todoist for years. It has a nice, clean design. Without cluttering the interface with a bunch of buttons it's still easy to add tasks, subtasks, projects, priorities and much more.",
Title says it all.  THE best task management app available.,
"When you think about Work/Life Balance, Todoist is the app that organizes everything. From shopping to Do in AM, Trip To Do List, Meeting Agenda Items to Discuss...and so much more. #todoistRocks",
"Brilliant app, elegant UI that is a simple as possible while still being powerful. Get on it.",
It's nice I can reorder tasks manually. It would be nice to be able to rate tasks by importance and urgency. All considered it's the best to-do app I've found.,
simple enough to not create friction with my daily work,
Nothing in this fast growing life can ease your everyday work like this app.,
"Tried Wunderlist, Google tasks, Keep, RTM and Todoist blows them all away. Simple interface but allows you to manage lots of projects effectively.",
"I used, Trello, and Calendar to keep track of tasks. All of them are nice, but not complete. Todoist brings the most useful task tracking features of all of them at one place. Now I have a task manager that I actually use!",
Even for someone that has a tough time giving up the old paper and pencil lists.,
"Just the tools for making small tasks effectively, that don't need project managing.",
Has some problems with sync but best todo list app out there! Love the inline parsing feature &lt;3 !!,
30€ per year is high too much for what it can.  Some one is trying to be rich quickly!,
"Love how it can categorize between work and personal lists,  and prioritize. Easy to use too.",
"Very good for time management, I've tried other apps but this one worked out best for me!! It has a simple and clean interface and is quick to add tasks/projects and good for improving my time management.",
Like the simple interface. No fancy stuffs like most apps I've tried. Straight-forward and easy to use. Well done.,
"Good for managing day-to-day stuff, basically you have to go premium if you really want to see if it helps you or not. But once you're there: Great cross-platform support, fast response rate to questions.",
Easily the best app for keep track of your tasks in an organized way. Very beautiful design and easy to use. Cross platform compatibility makes it available on whatever devices you use.,
"Or note taking, but I'm sure I'll learn using this app which I got for free (Pro features) with my new phone. (thanks mom)",
"Can do without the premium version, the free version is exactly what I need.",
"I've only recently started using this app but so far, apart from one or two minor problems I'm finding it quite useful.",
"This is a great app for keeping checks on what needs doing, paying, sorting. some items locked for paid version.",
Free version is quite good.  This is my to do app until I find something better.,
"This app can improve, track day-to-day work effectively if you use it seriously with your goals/targets in the mind :) 4 star as its just couple of weeks now ;)",
"Great app, much easier than a calendar for quick To so list reminders.",
I strongly dislike that I have to have an account to use Todoist. It makes no sense. Uninstalling so I can install a to do list that won't force me to have an account.,
I have tried many to-do apps and this is definitely THE BEST of them ALL.,
"Updated to material design, its pretty awesome and still does everything its always done. Great app to have.",
Seems like a good app and it's featured so my expectations. Just downloading,
A very handful tool to get things done,
"Intuitive, fast, no bloat and cross platform sync.",
Pretty much does everything I need and is very simple to use.,
"Many rich features, while maintaining a nice minimalist feel. I also appreciate the smooth cross-platform usability - well done!",
This is a perfect app choice for a person who always forgets what to he/she has planned. 5 stars!,
Used a lot of other to do lists. This is the best one. Toggl integration is great for focus on the tasks.,
"While the app is otherwise great, the widget occasionally fails to update and requires opening the app.",
Great app.  I love the multi platform capability. Easy to use. Great sorting options. Love the quick entry.,
Does exactly what I wanted it to. No missing functionally behind a paywall. Excellent.,
Love this app - quick syncing between phone and desktop app. Works perfectly for small projects and personal lists,
"At the peak of productivity with todoist.thoughtfully put tasks in todoist.dont call it a day,till you have completed the tasks for the day. Great tool,ui,ux excellent.",
Is a way to link to google calendar.,
"I've only been using it for a handful of tasks, but it's been helpful.",
"Wish less features were premium, and more free to use... also premium is very expensive, which is discouraging. Very nice interface though",
"Great app, just love it. Have the extension on outlook which lets me easily add tasks from email",
"Love this app, very simple to use which encourages you to use it more. Has made me much more organised and productive.",
"Great in every perspective, but, having a bunch of tasks still missing the start and end date (duration) and a graphical representation like a gantt for example. This would make todoist the best todo in the universe.",
Great app. Keeps things organised. And lovely interface too.,
"I paid for the premium upgrade because of the supposed outlook integration.  While you can create a task from an Outlook email,  there is virtually no integration between the two. As soon as the Outlook message is filed,  the app cannot locate it anymore. It tries to search for the message but never finds it.  Sadly,  I only now discovered that this was brought up more than two years ago. Oh well. If outlook integration is what you are looking for,  look elsewhere.",
It's real easy to use and it's great that it reminds you of what you have not finished yet.,
This is a great little app. Helps me keep on track without being too complicated.,
"Best productivity software I've used. Simple and lightweight, but with tons of flexibility if you have a more complex system.  For serious organizers (GTD and the like), Pro is worth every penny.",
Using for the last month. Helps keep me focused on what should come first in my To Do list.,
Tasking app that works. I ama project manager/auditor and this app/tool helps keep on task and on time.,
Love how it integrates with Gmail. And my wife and I can assign tasks to each other.  Great stuff.,
"Projects, viewing today, subtasks, sharing, etc. Very user friendly. Respects my workflow/the way i add and track tasks. Filters need to be more powerful even for a basic version.",
This is the greatest app in to do list category which can be linked to email and can be shared with others. Besides it is always good to have all your options while using to do list app,
"My ""go to"" task manager. I've used it every day for a couple of years and it's great with establishing simple, repetitive habits and also tackling complex, big projects.",
I especially enjoy the fact that you can sort things by name,
"It's very simple, easy to use and I just love the multi platforms use and synch. I can add my tasks on the pc or phone for the next day, week or month then check them on the go! using my smart watch. It's amazing!",
"Easy to navigate through,  sends you reminders,  allows you to create new projects etc. 'Says what it does on the tin'",
Works instinctively.  Able to share tasks with others. Pc and mobile apps both equally good,
Screw all the other to-do apps! Todoist gets every function and user interface detail right.,
Great app. But I wanted an option that allows us to create the same activity for many days.,
"I highly recommend this app, though I will say, it's only truly ""worth it"" once you pay for the annual premium upgrade. As of this review, that's $30 per year.",
Easy to maintain lot of thinks . Which we can't able to remember alot.,
"Love this app! It has simple yet nice design and layout. It helps to improve my productivity, especially the intelligent entry! Love it!",
"Great for accountability.  Easy, clean interface.  Thanks",
"It is ABSURD that I can't find how to clear my completed tasks out of a project on my phone. Shake doesn't work, so I'm at a complete loss. Get this fixed please.",
This helps me keep track of the many many things quite comfortably!,
"Easy to use, just have to type remaining it'll take care..",
It's better than having sticky notes all around.,
"I dunno, its good man. Worth giving it a shot. gets the job done",
"Now I never forget any of my tasks, though it is business or personal...Thanks to todoist..",
Easily created and modifiable. Keeps me on target with no more forgotten things to do.,
Great app easy to use still not using to its full potential but I'm getting there definitely recommend though,
Have used many to do list apps before. This has got to be the best,
Best app to track and plan my day to day stuff,
Really good if you're keeping tasks for multiple projects,
"Updated:  Have switched over to Wunderlist as the app forced me upgrade to a paid version to be able to set reminders. I've been using this app for close to a year now. I love the fact that I can move tasks up and down per priority, create, custom categories (client, hobby,etc) and save tasks under them. Date and time reminders. I can also view the tasks from the day or the category view. It drives my day!",
Good. I want the completed tasks to be displayed in the free version. Please do the needful.,
Good to keep checklists and get things done without fail,
Great features for free but the monthly fee is not something I would pay for. Should make it 1 time fee and more people would purchase. Any chance for tasker support to send to wearable? I'd give it 5 stars.,
"Finally getting organized, and it's a little eerie how easy & yes, even fun this app has made it!",
Integrates beautifully with Google Calendar & Chrome. Run it on multiple OS's seamlessly.,
This app is helpful with keeping me on track and on time it sends me alerts before action is required so I can prepare it's also fun with the way it right to you on your productivity,
"Tired of making lists on post its? Tired of bad timing for longterm projects? Try this - it's free. I use it daily, and the website and app combo are great!",
Great app for my bad memory!,
"Lots of functionality embedded, supports location aware reminders",
Nice layout and platform but at $40 a year is a bit much....,
Tried others but this is best.,
This is a great app it helped me get back on track just in time for school!,
"Not only does the app work great, it is also extremely intuitive.",
"I was looking for a lightweight, cross platform task tool, and todoist fits the bill!",
Simple and functional with the features I need to stay organized and productive.,
Very limited capability in free version. Unefficient and annoying,
The email reminders are extremely helpful and the platform itself has proven to be so useful.,
Like the date-word recognition and the ease with which it can be cancelled,
Most todo or task apps aren't flexible enough but this one lets me work the way I like to work which means it works for me better than any other app,
Thanks to this I know what I have to do and when it needs to be done. No more last minute rushing.,
Neat and clean. Get things done!,
"Getting used to this, bit by bit.",
"Using this app for three months, tremendous!!",
I love keeping track of to do lists by category and assigning items to others.,
"hope include reminder later. otherwise, todoist will lose competitiveness with other apps.",

Just what I was looking for.  The perfect rl to do list.,
Must have app for an entrepreneur. My startup life depends on this app. Period.,
Great way to quantify work and assign tasks. Very useful,
"This app does what it is supposed to do,  and does it well.",
We have tried several shared task management apps and this one is great!,
The app allows me to keep my priorities on my phone and not posted on my wall.,
Love the way it's designed. Great for keeping up to speed with to do list,
The best thing is it also reminds you about ur pending work in email so that we do not procrastinate,
Really good app that enables you to get things done,
Syncs to all my devices. ..use it for personal and business,
I can access my lists from any of my devices. Very helpful.,

Excellent it has replaced all my paper notes,

Simple to do list and works with my watch,

One of the best TODO app.  Sync across all devices,
I feel so accomplished when I check something off!,
I use it for remembering homework and daily tasks,
works great as an app and the integration with G apps is seamless,
Keep up the good work,
I am able to manage my modules and study units well with the projects and subtasks features,
App is simple to use and very useful to keep track of ToDos.,
"Does what it says it will, 5 stars but would like it to work with my calender",
to set reminder u need to pay wic is the bad thing,
"The newer versions for Android got worse than older ones. (1) There's no longer an option for you to add subtasks to a task in the widget; you now need to search for the task in the app; (2) when you do something to a task in the widget, you cannot undo it; (3) the ""add task"" menu on widget is cumbersome to use, with most options hidden from view ; (4) the labels for days in the ""Next 7 Days"" mode is now white instead of red, making it v.hard to see what days youre looking at when you scroll down.",
Lol 21 quid a year for a to-do list app are you on lsd or some other hallucinogenic substances,
Love the daily reminders. Very useful for completing daily tasks.,
Never forgot any thing TO DO !!!,

Todoist must unlock premium features upon reaching 50000++ karma,

Prefect,

"I've tried pretty much every to do app there is and this one really is the best. Very flexible and functional, with great support too.",
I find this app particularly helpful as a tool to remember what I wanted to get done. In my fast-paced life what is important to do can get lost in all the pressures of every day tasks. This app helps by providing an easy way to record a task you want to remember and reminders of the tasks you set a specific date for.,
"I tried other to do list apps, I even went old school with paper and pen but nothing helped.  Todoist came along and blew me away.  I love the simple user face and I love that there's so much more behind that interface to help me get through my day.",
"I hardly there ever review apps. But this has literally changed the way I work and live. There are so many features, but my favorite is emailing to add a task. The integration between devices is seamless. If you've been looking for a way to better manage work and to do lists this is your answer. The premium version is totally worth the annual fee.",
"Amazing app, looks a lot better than the last to do list widget I was using. The only thing I think could be improved is that lack of customization. Several of my other widgets are transparent or partially transparent. So this sort of ruins the the theme of my pages (However, features like this aren't necessary, just icing on the cake). Additionally, bring able to change the text to different colors and/to to send degree of transparency separately from the background would be cool too.",
"My needs are simple, so this app does just what I need. It syncs up with my work computer to keep me on top of the many projects I have going at once and I take it everywhere with me (on my phone) so when I think of something I need to get done i just jot it down on the app. This is especially useful for someone whose time is as divided as mine (and whose mind might be getting a little to old to keep up with it all without the app).",
"Though I have retired, I have many things to accomplish. Todoist frees me from the daily grind of updating status at the desk, and helps me capture ideas on the run. Would like two features added : Some tasks are for a specific time, like a meeting. Would be nice to be able to set time duration.  And when I complete a task, there is often a follow up task that emerges. Would be nice to press follow up button to 'string -on' the follow on task.",
The best free task management tool you can ever lay your hands on.. make your mornings worry free with this.. add dates and days to tasks by just typing it into the tasks.. every morning right before you start for office get the list of things to do. Make personal and office works very efficiently...,
"Having tried all the options, Todoist is imperfect like the rest, but about as good as it gets! Good for making hierarchical structured tasks, and breaking them up to accomplish them. A few more options for customisation and granular control would go a long way, but the advantage is that everything feels very quick and natural compared to other apps.",
"The app is more restricted than I remember. I can't add any comments to a task, I can only add text to the task itself. It would be nice if there was a free version of the app, without all the features we can't use. I'm debating if I should continue to use it or try another app that works across Android and Windows.",
"I'm just starting to get the hang of this app, so far it's wonderful. I'm trying to use it to organize my life and so far it's been helpful; but I've noticed there's no way to organize tasks in ascending order so that the newest tasks are at the top. It would be awesome to be able to use the widget  that way, so my latest highest priority tasks came in that order. Maybe I'm missing something? Either way I hope your app helps me make a difference in my life.",
Quite simply I can't remember my life before todoist and yet I've only been using it for a few weeks. Perfect hassle free way to get stuff done. Brilliant. Pair it with IFTTT for power power power,
"Simplistic design helps me focus on what's important - the task. Adding new tasks is easy, especially with conversational inputs. Categorization tools allow me to maintain balance between work and life since I can assign to Projects and only see the tasks I want at any given time. Smitten.",
"This has improved my productivity quite a bit. When I originally wrote this there wasn't a no due date button in the app, and now there is, so I've changed my rating. One feature I would like is being able to import / export project templates as .CSV files in the app. Other than that this app is great!",
"Wow! I didn't expect a simple application with a very easy user interface can help me manage my time so well to the point where I get many things done daily on my summer holiday! The fact that I can easily manage time is enough to give a 5 star rating. And if there was a sixth star , I would have given it! Like seriously the developers deserve a well earned *pat on the back*  😊",
I use this at work and at home and it makes remembering all the things i have to do so much easier. The thing that sets it above other apps for me is the repeat options. I can type 'every thurs' or 'next fri' or even 'fortnightly starting tue' and it understands me. So simple,
The scary part is how work I have outstanding.  Simple to use and helps me stay focused on the important stuff,
"I once thought that I had experienced all of the highs & lows that this life had to offer, that is until the day fate led me to this App. Once download I felt I had reached the kind of organisational enlightenment most only dream of achieving in this modern world.. I find that I am now more at peace with myself knowing that this little App will not only retain in it's memory but also remind of the tasks I must perform that my own mind had long since forgotten.. Thank you Devs for making my life so complete.",
Been using all day for several years & will continue to unless something obviously better comes along. Getting better - last major update was a big step. Still far from perfect for me but with work arounds it gets the job done.,
"This is the best to do list I have used. It just reminds you daily what you've given yourself to do, or missed and isn't full of alerts every hour. It perfectly reminds you, without being overtly intrusive.",
Dont think too much. just note it on Todoist  to forgot  and to ensure keep  tracking it till completion. Don't waste paper too.,
Favourite to do app I've used so far. Powerful but easy to use. I like the way it rewards you for getting things done too.,
"Use this app not only to manage my own and my team but aslo my whole life, its integrations are just perfect, syncronization work great. Interface is very simple but still, very powerful. Service is responsive, updates regular.... my last and only wish is an integration to OneNote, rest is just perfect !",
"I love todoist, it has lots of easy to use features. I recommended some more features and wish they will implement them soon.",
This app is a life saver. I quickly write what I want to and and later could deal with it without having to fight to remember. I sends reminders on time.,
"I use this app every day, it just works with my habits & I love setting due dates that remind me to do things. The only complaint that I have is the upgrade is expensive and for an entire year. Id like to pay less for a month long trial.",
"I was too impulsive to buy the paid version ;) and have not fully explored the possibilities of the paid version, but for now, it is a great app.",
"Been going strong with Todoist for months now and have been trying to utilize the GTD method, it's easy enough to add and manage items effortlessly enough that it hasn't become burdensome.",
Really simple swiping interface   makes it very easy to keep track of everything. I use it for school work and personal errands and I never forget to do anything anymore.,
"The accomplished goal just goes away after you complete it. I like seeing my accomplished goals, it can be a source of motivation.",
Mostly good for basic use but would like to be able to drag and drop things to do within the widget. Otherwise very pleased.,
This is an best task manager I've found so far.. But cost is really too high.. No monthly payment options or EMI had to switch to other task manager for more accessibility for features..,
I love how easy it is to set the due date. It sends an email with reminders for the day. I've used other list apps and this is the easiest to use.,
I'm still finding out more on this product. I'd like it to integrate with my Outlook calendar and Gmail calendar but I haven't got that to work yet. Once I have time to investigate further it should be more helpful to me.,
"I live on this app, its beautiful easy to use and syncs everywhere. At one point they had voice suppory through google now. That was a huge dissapointment when it went away",
Still a novice but I'm impressed with this app thus far and look forward to maximizing its use in the future. Frequent use of the tutorials  and forums  are key to learning  and utilizing the many aspects of this tool.,
todoist enable me to create my   complex schedule which no other to do list could that I had try. And I'm not using premium.,
"I am an plan it out, organize it, kind of person so of course in the past I have downloaded tons of todolist apps but none where ever exactly what I was looking for. This particular one is just awesome. It functions well and is just Great all around Love it!!!!",
"Todoist has allowed for me to get all of my task in front of my face in a simple and beautiful format, which causes me to get more done I n a timely manner.",
Todist has helped me remember regular occurring things and the things that pop up during the day/week.  I like that it's web based and I can use it on my mobile devices.  The only thing that confuses me is that my phone doesn't sync well and doesn't remove completed tasks.,
"This is what I'm using right now, because it helps me visualize my workflow so well. Three quivels - 1) not much there there to the Google Now ""integration"" (it will ask you if you want to use with Todoist & that's about it); 2) natural language could be more natural (I get a lot of ""we don't understand that date"" - Remember The Milk's is far better) 3) there is no way to bulk edit for non-date fields (label, priority - again, RTM does this); also date changes are unpredictable with recurring tasks.",
"A bit hard to use at first as it doesn't give instruction on how to use, but it's fantastic once you get the hang of it. I get everything done and more efficiently.",
I have so many active projects going on inside and outside of work.  Todoist helps me to keep track of all the things I need to do! I used to use a pen and paper planner but I've shifted to using this app because of its convenience.,
"Light, seamless tool that helps me stay on top of my ToDos easily with minimal touch",
"I love this app and service.  The phone, tablet and web version are all great. I've got our whole organisation using it to manage our projects.",
After I figured out how to use the app   I can't believe how awesome it is. Really organizes my day.,
"I can create simple todo lists without hassel. Takes 2 seconds to add to the list, and makes it easy to manage.",
"Talked to them on Twitter, got a very fast response. Kudos! Options to recur Tasks hourly, daily, you name it.  Reminders as paid sucks but using IF and Google Now makes up for it.",
"After trying all the tools, this is the one that worked across my ecosystem of tools the best, and had an affordable pro level.",
"There are a couple of issues which take the edge off it. Drag to reorder sometimes doesn't work, the card just pops back to its last position. Sub tasks show up twice in the today view.",
"It was good, now it is great. Fast and extremely usable. In the arms race of productivity apps, Todoist again takes the lead.",
"I am on the free trial, but I doubt I will upgrade for SUBSCRIPTION!",
"I'm in a long distance relationship and having the ability to create a shared project and use it as a shared to do list that we can both add to is great, very helpful 😊",
Great app for keeping up with all my To-Do's and lists.  I've tried many and this is the one that works best for me.,
"Super easy to use to do list, and great features. Highly recommend it for anyone needing a quick place to put and manage tasks.",
"simple tool that will help you get things done. break big goals into smaller tasks, enter them in todoist and get them done one by one",
This is one of the easiest to use and maintain apps. Lacks features like sub tasks which is available on Wunderlist. I have moved to managing my tasks online from notebook and sticky notes.,
Love the ability to connect it to so many services.  Can integrate both work and home,
Free version has most of what I need including offline access on phone so I can add and view tasks when I'm out of range. Tags would be great but not available for free.,
Excellent.... However paid version is expensive than required and free version has important features missing.,
"Good app overall, easy to use and look great. Only feedback would be to improve further on the versatility of task-setting, by adding more advanced options asf",
Using the free version ATM. It is simple to use. Has a good widget. The application has a few themes with free version and more with the paid version.,
I particularly like the projects/sub projects that you can create multiple lists with. Wish we didn't have to upgrade for the calendar sync though.,
"Simple, quick, but still all a round type of to-do program. 5/5 after some try outs with calendar and memo based programs..This alarm like app is great!",
But there is an problem while building task hierarchy. The problem is always present when I try to modify the hierarchy of tasks and then kill the app. After running application the hierarchy is a little different,
I've been a paid user for nearly two years and really enjoy Todoist. It's the best task and project management app for any mobile device.,
"Really great app, works well but a little spammy on the emails.",
"The best todo app out there, in my opinion.  Certainly the most flexible.  Beautiful layout, easy to use.  I highly recommend it.",
But still not quite what I was looking for. The premium  features might make the difference.,
Great layout app for list of task you need to perform. Isn't amazing that we can share or designated a task.,
The only app I found that integrates well with my outlook calender! Love the reminders and being able to task emails.,
"While I like the robust features like creating subtasks, I also wish it were simpler to create subtasks--delineating the levels. At the very least, please make the indents further apart so that visually I can tell what is sub to what at a quick glance.",
"Have been using Todoist for a few days only but I'm really enjoying its simplicity. The daily and weekly views are a productivity boost. Maybe, just maybe, this may replace my physical Bullet Journal.",
Kind of complicated and I don't like how it makes random suggestions when you add todo items.,
"Like it, buy i cannot find a way to see a history of the completed tasks.",
It's very simplistic yet useful. I enjoy the synchronization with my work and home computers.,
"Awesome widget - definitely worth trying out. Switch between different types of todos, mark them as done, add them... Very compact and powerful",
Very useful. One problem maybe is: too less possibilities to group tasks.,
One thing don’t like about this app is that if I set a task to Roxy reoccur everyday and by chance forgot to check it on to Todoist and check it next day it will also check right today’s one.,
The constant reminder of overdued tasks may seem irritating but it keeps you in line with your goals and prevents further procrastination.,
Seriously good application. Like the link with Gmail to notify you of tasks forgotten (or overdue....) seriously effective.,
Not with much complex featutes this is a nice one to try.,
"Solid to do app. I like the ability to use it on multiple platforms, and the ability to add projects with subtasks. However, all the notifications and emails are a bit excessive and obnoxious.",
"This has been my favorite to-do app for years, and I've used a few of them. Clear user interface, supported across multiple platforms and devices, and IFTTT integration.",
I wish a little more premium features could be added to the free version of the app.. Or at least the reminders. Other than that it's a good app. 👍,
Trying to get used to it and they email too much...,
Helps me stay organized no matter which device I'm closest to.  Make entries as they occur to me via cell.  Review or act on them later while working on lap top.  PERFECT!,
Really easy to use. Can import projects via .CSV - use autohotkey to generate the file etc. Keeps me more organised than I have ever been :D,
I like that this app allows you to organize your to-do lists into multiple colour-coded categories. Perfect for everything from my daily to do lists to my grocery list and even a books to read list. Fantastic.,
Stays on you to meet your goals and get things done.,
Still getting used to it but should end up helping me if I can stay dedicated to using the app!,
Havent dived into all its abilities yet.,
Try it first if you're looking for an application to keep you organized!,
"Not to into the Karma thing its something I do not believe in, can we rename it to productivity mastery?",
Even reminds you throughout the day that you have a certain amount of things to do and how many of those you have completed.,
Todoist is now my every day app. One day cannot pass without me referring to it. So far the best productivity app in the market.,
"Paid version is a great app. Sleek simple interface, works well with many other apps and services on multiple platforms. The following aspects could be improved, karma system expanded, statistics improved, no Cortana integration.",
Well constructed. Will take a bit of time to master all the intricacies but enjoying it greatly,
Beautifully developed application that really drives you to be productive just for the satisfaction of clicking that checkbox. One area of improvement though would be to have more multicoloured themes for premium and business  users,
"More organised now, save my time and not worry of forgetting staff to do.",
It works as a good assistant helping me look at all the outstanding tasks. Widget makes it easily accessible.,
We used this app to manage orders and shipments for several months before upgrading to an inventory management system.,
The natural language feature paired with the quick add notification means that I can quickly write pretty much every task that comes to mind.,
This app is nothing too special.  It works fine and is helpful.  You have to pay to use lots of features.,
The free version is okay.  I imagine paying for the full version would be cool but haven't done that yet,
"I always have a lot of to do list apps...this one is the best for me because it keeps sending me an email of my to do list, so its a constant reminder...and that's what i need to get my list done in the midst of all i am doing",
"early beginner, but love it a lot. especially when being able to use it across platforms.Update: 5 months later I still enjoy it a lot!",
This app is the closest one among all other apps to what I wanted in an app for managing my tasks.,
"Use this app. If you forget, it'll send you reminders. Extremely helpful whether you have only a handful of things to accomplish, or whether your days are metered out by deadlines where everything must be accomplished in a timely fashion; this app will help you.",
"Actually, no, life changer. If you dig GTD, this is the greatest",
Absolutely fantastic. Exactly what I have been searching for. Will be upgrading to the paid version immediately.,
"Does the job, could provide a bit more flexibility in the free version but good enough.",
I am so much more organized and it works well with gtd!!,
Works well. Better than the several others I've tried. Makes listing more efficient and organized. Thanks devs.,
The ability to set up project folders makes this incredibly useful.  Interface is simple to use.,
It's good but it still need some more improvement like giving home screen notification and alarm for free,
"This is one of the most important productivity tools I use on a daily basis. It has helped me keep track of what I need to accomplish efficiently, and celebrate when I get something finished. Being able to check something off of this digital task-organizer is satisfying like a pen-and-paper to-do list, but this app is capable of so much more by a long shot. I give it five stars for meeting my organisational needs, and for being so easy to use with its pleasing, minimalist interface.",
"Very simple, easy to use, things stay on list till marked completed- the simplicity I was looking for",
A simple interface that works across platforms. All that I needed in a to do list.,
"I used to have it on my phone and tablet (&lt;3) but was forced to get a new phone and now I can't log in on my new phone. I don't understand why it wont send me an email for forgetting my password. I've tried tablet, phone, and computer.",
Totally easy and convenient and has tree best widgets of any to do list I've found,
Love this app. Helps me keep track of everything I have to do and stay organized.,
It's really helping me to get things done.,
Love being able to assign ALL task attributes in a single action!,
This is just what I have been looking for to get me more organised. Simply awesome,
It's so useful that I keep asking my friends to buy me the premium version haha,
The best app for making a list of things to get done.,
This is brilliant. I had not realised how much I needed this.,
Let's you seperate tasks in category and it is very easy to manage.,
"Well designed, great for both work and personal life.",
The best app i've ever used. Thanks Todoist team :) you've changed my Life. :),
I love this app. Such an easy way to keep track of everything. And it's fun! (I'm a nerd!),
I like everything about this app. The best of all is that I can manage my tasks from Gmail.,
So good! Added to my phone and it's on my quick launch circle.,
This app is amazing it has kept me up to date with my work!😊,
"Love it,  i recommend it to everyone!",
Too expensive paid version tho,
Get this app and become a Todoist. Frfr.,
"I've been using this app for 2 years. It keeps me organized, motivated, and productive. Thanks Todoist!",
"I just need a simple app for to do and to complete, they want to charge 28.99 to see my complete tasks. This all is not worth that at all. Way too much. Even 10 might be ok but still high.",
I used Evernote for years.  I like this better and recommend you give it a try!,
Just wanted a list to check off with reminders. This app does it well.,
"I have been searching for a to-do-list app for a while, this app nailed it!",
Free version does exactly what I need. Good method for putting in repeat tasks.,
"Former Wunderlist user, found Todoist to be better designed, now a premium subscriber.",
Does everything I have thought of so far. Love the sharing features.,
Subtasks still seem a bit of fumble and I wish start/end times were a feature!,
"The best to do app I've ever used, deserves five stars",
Best to-do app out there. Very simple yet feature rich.,
Simple to use as well. Very much considering subscription!,
Very helpful for doing our daily base work by reminding and notifications ....,
"Using it for a year, daily. All is fine!",
Good app have used only the free version .Found it to be useful.,
Love being able to swipe my tasks off of an electronic list!,
This is not overly complex like other organization apps.,
"Works great, good features like secure notes and password history",
Love the simplicity,
Finding it really useful in balancing different commitments and ensuring nothing is forgotten,
I tried for so long to find the best task manager app. I really like todoist,
A little more for free users would have been great.,
"Good ui, the service providers a good level of reminders.",
Great app except the most important feature is a paid one...and kind of expensive too..,
I have tried several task management apps and Todoist is the best.,
Good to have something that reminds me on both app and email.,
"This app simoly does what it tells, and it do it well",
Its really helpful and easy to use!!,
"It's useful, unfortunately there's no reminder. The reminder only for pro :|",
I'm actually keeping track of task!,
"If everything needs upgrading to Premium, why have this free version? I prefer Google Keep",
Enough to make your day more productive,
It is incredible how facilitate my task and how it can be connected with others,
I've tried some similar apps but chose to stick to this one : ),
I will most likly get the full version because i like it so much,
Helps me to  do my work in more organized  manner.,
Like the application easy to use and I love the Outlook Extension,
"I use this app with my accountability partner, and we've been getting a lot done because of it!",
I do forget my tasks usually todoist helps me to remember me,
A really neat way to keep track of my tasks! :),
Easy to use and helpful reminder. Great app!,
So if your Premium function will become free then it is more fascinating,
Great app. Very helpful in organizing to do's.,
It helps me to get things done,
Very helpful in getting organised.,
My favorite task manager to date! And ive tried them all :-),
Functionality is great - works for me!,
For staying on top of the To-do list,
This is one of the best productivity tools out there.,
Not that much useful.ok.,
Helps me stay organized and on schedule with tasks and errands.,
Amazing UI and shortcuts,
Nuff said,
The best to do list app out there,
Love that you Can have a written time recognized,
Very useful app,
Very simple and straightforward. User friendly interface,
Well presented colourful it was very clear I could read it wonderfully well done Google+,
Free version absolutely useless without reminders,
Easy to use and keeps me on track!,
helps me orginize my life,
"Rock solid synching, gorgeous UI",
Helpful app for day to day activities,
Please add month view or a calendar view,
"Minimalistic, but a little lacking on features",
Its simplicity and ease of use is remarkable.,
Simple list and project App.,
This is the Best to do list.,
hate the paid subscription,
good app but not reminder available,
Great to do app will be purchasing premium,
Does a good enough job for my needs,
Really love this app,
Good but should integrate with email and calendar,
Simple design but very effective,
Great app to track my activities,
Good for increasing personal efficiency,
Thank you for better service.,

Productivity at its fullest,
First of its kind that i actually like,
Perfect for me,
So far so good,
"I like the emails to remind me about tasks,appts, etc....",

Needs FREE GOOGLE CALENDAR INTEGRATION.,
Nice App to manage day to day activities,
Todoist is the ooist app ever!,
"Easy to use, functional and simple",

Todoist,
"I really like this app for the simplicity and ease of adding a task.  I would have given 5* if the task display is a bit more intuitive.  Currently overdue tasks take most of the screen space and its hard to look at today's tasks.  Does it really matter if one overdue task is 45 days ago and another one is 44 days ago?  It will be much cleaner if there is an option to group them as 1 day ago, 1 week ago, 1 month ago and Sometime in the past.   I can reclaim a lot of screen space.",
"Minimalism and simplicity of interface, support of subtasks (tree), superfast adding of tasks and smooth desktop-smartphone data exchange is the main features I love in Todoist!",
The best :),
Lots of features make this usable not only for personal lists but project management as well. Worth the yearly subscription!,
"I tried many other apps, paid and unpaid, including Anydo, but they all seemed inferior to what I could do myself on a piece of paper or in Excel. This one is the only app that has its own programming and query language, which could be used to sort and prioritize tasks. If you know what you want, you should be able to achieve it with this app. Simple and extremely effective.",
"I tested a few other top rated to do list apps. This is by far my favorite. Simple interface with a lot of powerful features that you can choose to use or can easily ignore. This really helps organise my day / life for home and work. Tasks, jobs, things to purchase or need reminding about etc etc.",
"This app made managing my tasks and planning my day very easy. I find the daily summary in the morning very useful. I now use the app everyday. I love the Quick Add feature, especially since it now allows you to specify the project with the '#' symbol.",
"I'm using a one month trial of the pro app now, after 2 weeks of just the basic free version. I loved the basic but would have liked to have the comment ability included in it. As it is, the subscription fee ain't that much for my peace of mind so I'll probably continue once the trial is up.",
"One of the best to do list apps that there is, while not as feature rich as informant, it serves nicely on the essential features for those who don't want bells and whistle and just want a great cloud based to do list. It also has a unique karma system that rates you for completing tasks giving that extra motivation to complete your tasks.",
"So I had way too much going on and I needed to organize the tasks I had floating around in my mind and I didn't want to use the Google calendar. This app was exactly what I needed. I add a task and assign a day and boom, I had a much less troubled mind. I'd give it 5 stars if I could see a calendar. I would like to be able to see more than a week in advance without having to look through all my tasks.",
"Does the job smoothly, but I was incredibly annoyed by the app's habit of translating anything that looks like a day, date, or time and moving it to the due date ""for me"". I deal with a lot of events, and the info I put in is for me to distinguish among items, not for the due date. I haven't figured out how to turn this ""feature"" off. But there is no way this app is worth a yearly fee, especially not at the cost they are currently asking. A one-time fee, sure, but not repeated hits.",
I use this as a planner and task manager since I forget to do a lot of things. It's satisfying to cross it off and know that I'm on track. I also use this to manage my club board (who can also access this Todoist) and it helps us all visualize what we have done and what is still left do. I really enjoy this app!,
Todoist is a great productivity application. I really like the option to add in a specific time of the day. Todoist automatically puts the list in order with this feature. This app is totally worth it!     Side note: apps are great and I &lt;3 making list' but I constantly need to remind myself why I am trying to get things done. Sometimes I wish there was an app to remind me why I want to be productive.,
"Useless ""To Do List"" App, because you cannot even attach photos or other files to your tasks. I like to create lists of things to do around the house and that usually requires a reference photo for when I go to Home Depot or something. This functionality does not seem to exist and it seems you cannot even assign\share tasks with other users, which is standard with other apps, such as Wunderlist. I gave it a shot, but have to uninstall...",
"Features are easy to use with minimal bugs, only feature that doesn't make sense to me is that sub-tasks are not reset upon parent task completion/repeat... eg, I make a repeating task with 6 steps, but when it repeats, it still shows the 6 steps from last week already completed rather than needing to be done again this week.",
"Like it and better than other organising apps ive tried and love the projects and sub tasks, etc. I've upgraded to paid for version I liked it enough. Just find setting time and date alerts difficult. Or could be me but find myself tapping back and forth until I get there and I get the magic combo of date, time and notification type, whatever. For those who like lists and like that done it feeling, this delivers. But alerts and notifications and reminders could be easier to set and can be frustrating.",
"As a forgetful person Todoist really has helped me in my job as well as my personal life. In my opinion your really can't get any better than Todoist as far as GTD apps go. Beautiful interface, easy task creation, and a killer date engine. My only suggestion is to provide a way to return to the start page after you navigate away from it, as I have customized my start page heavily and need to use it a lot.",
"The sharability and ease of use is great. My main issue is the widget is not adjustable (at least for lg v10 marshmallow). The to do list is a big part of the app but having my agenda display (widget) from the home screen  conform to my screen size needs is a must. Right now there is only a 1x1 icon or a 4x3 agenda view, please add adjustability or other options like 5x2",
I've been trying out several productivity apps and this one has definitely been the best combination of design and practicality I've found. I did have a bit of an issue trying to add subtasks. I had to spend a bit more time figuring that out. It was the first time I tried to enter subtasks so probably is get used to the process here.,
"The best app ever. I am especially fond of the two ways to set up recurring tasks (after, every). Categorizing in projects, tagging, sharing projects with another person are all great features. And it's available in pretty much the same format across different platforms - Windows, chrome, android etc.",
I love todoist and their team. I've tried many productivity apps but none of them worked with my flexible way of working except todoist. I love the freedom within the app and the strong multi platform features as well as the teams regular social media advice of techniques to maximize the app. Love todoist,
"I love this app, I was looking for a to do app that would allow me to organize my tasks in projects, assign them to certain days and give them a priority degree and this app does that. The design is very nice and I like that all tasks are saved to am account so you don't have to organize them all again when you buy a new phone or have to re-download the app for whatever reason.                                      I highly recommend this app if you're into organizing and efficiency like I am!",
"I have been using this app for the last fortnight and have stuck after trialling 3-4 popular alteratives. It's easy to use, intuitive and well integrated with Android. Save your self the time and start here",
"Tried this several months ago,  but it just didn't work properly.  Read again  about all the wonderful features, so I was eager to give it another try.  Got an error message when I tried to sign up which said that I should try again in a few moments.   I waited a few minutes and then tried again.   And again.   And again.   And again.  Waited a few more hours and tried several times again.  Then a few days.  Then just gave up.",
"One of the most well thought out to-do list managers I've seen. Sure there are some features I would like to see like task duration and better predecessor handling,  but it's simplicity and superb UI keeps me using it more than the alternatives that do have all these advanced features.",
"This app helps me plan my day my, month and to some extent my life. Wonderful app by the developers. I have used the mobile as well as the desktop version, both are very very convenient to use. I haven't used any other application of this genre and never felt the need to try others. It is undoubtedly the leader. One suggestion include some tutorials as i am still discovering many new and very useful features of the app.",
"I'm way more organized, there a small learning curve but todist instructions are very easy to learn. The premium features are well worth the money and plus its does not cost that much. there are deals now and than.",
"For those that made the switch from Microsoft to Apple, it took some getting used to - This app is no different.  This app is great but it has its own way of doing things that takes getting used to.  Things like:  Recurring dates, rather than copy and paste, or typing the time rather than clicking via the calendar etc.  I would have offered 5 stars had the app incorporated some of the other methods of working.",
Not very motivated to purchase only one year of a task/goal list. Since it is an app if I am to pay $30 that should be mine to keep. I understand the people that put effort into this should get their money's worth and I would be more willing to pay if it was not yearly or kept any of my info.,
"Edited to add:  Reinstalled, which fixed sync but lost all my new entries and completed entries. I still don't know if I reconstructed my work completely and correctly, and I won't know until I run into a real world problem caused by the data loss.   And yes, I contacted support, which offered the same suggestion (after I'd already given up and reinstalled). The point is that I did not want to lose my work, and I knew that a reinstall would do exactly that.   Not happy, Todoist.  Original comment:  One star until you fix sync.",
Works really well. Has good subtasks feature which a lot of to do apps dont have. Also love the gmail plugin. Another thing i LOVE is forwarding my emails to Todoist. And the super customizable recurring and due dates feature is great. Most apps dont let you do schedules like every Monday and Thursday at noon. Todoist does.  I would like to be able to make filters that can exclude projects. For example i have a project i call personal and use two Todoist widgets on my tablet. I'd like see one widget with ju,
"Managing to-do 's quickly is an art, it cannot be boring but it needs structure. Almost by contradiction it needs to be 'light' to use but have a certain depth of functionality. This balance is just the hardest to achieve but TD have pulled that off and across multiple devices.",
the second i think of something i need to do i can quickly enter in the task and then review later what needs to be done. its very satisfying when i complete a task and get to check it off. i wish it kept a history of what i completed just to have a record but thats my only complaint.,
"Couldn't be happier.  Been using a number of Todo list apps on IOS, Android and PC for years and struggled to get one I was happy with; easy to use, seamless syncing across all my devices, nice interface and allowing me to group and arrange tasks as I wish.    Todoist has ticked the boxes.  It allows easy sorting, scheduling and grouping of tasks and basically does what it says on the tin very well.  Most importantly however it does so with a very slick interface that gets the trade-off between functionality and form just right.   The web interface is classy, as is the IOS interface.  The Android app (at least on my phone as opposed to my iPad)  is a bit more constrained but I suspect this is due to screen size limitations.  Finally, Todoist is well supported - there are maintenance updates to the web version occurring almost daily and a constant stream of new features.  So highly recommended.",
"Great organizational app! I love the use of natural language. Many features are accessible without a premium subscription, which is also a great bonus! You do not get SMS or email reminders about each task without premium, but it does send a reminder in the morning of how many tasks you have for the day, including any overdue tasks from previous days. I really enjoy the addition of Karma when you complete tasks. Integrates between my MacBook and Galaxy wonderfully, too!",
"Can we please have a filter query to detect having no child tasks, or is there some way we can currently do this? That way I can view all tasks with a certain label that aren't blocked by other sub tasks with different labels. Also, multiple parents would be useful for situations when several tasks are blocked by one task. 5 stars if that's possible.",
"I use Todoist only as a shopping list manager, even though it's loaded with features. You can completely ignore the things you're not interested in, the app doesn't care. It's sync reliability is better than Google Keep, which is why I switched to it. After having used it for a while, I find the mechanics of everyday use to be quite intuitive and delightful. Sharing a list with my family, it helps us mark/unmark items as completed with simple swipes. The widget is great too, comes in handy when shopping.",
"It has a lot of features for free and is pretty simple to use. I was able to find a way for it to do everything I needed. However, instead of giving you directions upfront ie. for setting repeating tasks & making headers, I had to find ""hacks"" that weren't really hacks because it's a real feature in a todoist blog. A link to this in app would be useful. It syncs btwn devices easily, but the Windows10 app is glitchy. The email notifications of undone tasks are a nice free feature. I recommended it often.",
This is a really nice app to use and maks planning your tasks a breeze. The yearly $50 to unlock all features is to expensive compared to other apps. Would happily pay the $50 once off to unlock all features but not yearly. Would be 5 stars if you change pricing.,
"Better than Any.do, Wunderlist, Google Tasks or Keep, and other planning tools I've tried. Feature request: I want to schedule things for ""Morning"", ""Afternoon"", and ""Evening"", without having to specify the hour. Otherwise, some priority-one 10pm chores are listed above priority-two daytime tasks, making my list order all dysfunctional. I made a complex workaround, but assigning broad time chunks would be nice.",
"It would be great if the notification feature was part of the free version, but beggars can't be choosers. Otherwise, it is a nice little app to help keep track of things coming up across platforms. Just have to remember to check it in the morning.",
"Love the cross-platform integration (Android and Mac for me!), UI, and the fact that the free option is all I need. I used to use Remember the Milk and was a Pro user but the outdated design and lack of a Mac app was a deal breaker. This is perfect.",
"I like the simplicity of the UI and its availability on all devices. Most of all, it is the only todo list that works for me. Thank you for developing this app! I just wish the free version have access to more premium functions like reminders. It is annoying seeing great functions but not using it.",
I'm the type of guy that does one thing at a time. I focus on one task and that usually means I forget a lot of other things that I need to do. This application tells me when one of my tasks are late and it helps to build habits and routines by allowing the creation of daily tasks. It also allows you to create recurring task ie: 'every Wednesday at 6' do this task. The app records and schedules these tasks automatically so you know you won't miss a deadline. This app helped me organize my life! Great app!,
"I am a total nut about organization and planning and planners in general. I have jumped around and tried so many different methods, processes, and products (mostly because I really like testing out new stuff to organize my life). Todoist is the only thing that has lasted throughout my crazy try-out periods. It is the single best app I have and I would be lost with out it. Take it from someone who likes to plan out EVERYTHING: todoist makes it so easy to rearrange when plans change. It's the best!!!!!!!",
"The free version of the app works great! The interface is amazing, it works with it a glitch,  and fills a perfect utility void. I would upgrade, but the subscription price is kind of high,  and not being an out right purchase is pretty annoying.  Also,  if there was calander interface or widget presentation, it would probably be worth it.",
"I have alot to do these days- homeschooling 3 kids, housework, working, keeping track of medications, appts. This is a great organizer  because I can make multiple lists with different due dates and  reminders. Then I can also bring up everything due today from different lists. I can name my lists and give them different colors and that's all for free! It's awesome! I'm going to see what cool stuff comes with their pro version! Great job!",
The widget is one of the best bits meaning this tool is constantly at my fingertips which makes it easy to utilise and committ too. As an advocate of David Allen's GTD methodology i love this app for a lot of reasons and highly recommend it to everyone.,
"Tried several and keep coming back to this one. Can't find anything any better. Easy to enter info, like the postpone button and the over-due function does not create hundreds of entries that I gave to go back, delete, and clean up.",
"This app gives you just what you need, a tool that keeps track on the things you have to do everyday and also has a rating that you progress as you finish tasks. That system makes normal tasks feel like quests that you have to complete in order level up which is just so fun ☺️",
"Been using this app for years.  I only use the free version now, however.  While I have had the premium version in the past, I disnt fr I used enough of the premium features to warrant the cost.  It would be nice if there was an in between free and premium as I don't need many of the collaboration options.",
"Great system and seamlessly links to all formats - iOS, Android, laptop. Only shame is that you can't add notes unless you subscribe, unless you add a ghost task to contain those notes. You give all the functionality but could I suggest not making notes a priced extra or price it a bit lower? Great app though!!",
I've been a GTDer for 7 years and recently switched over from Toodledo. Which I've been using the past 5 years. I've tried what must be dozens of productivity and to-do list apps over the past 7 years and Todoist has been my most enjoyable experience to date. To-do lists don't have to be boring or visually unappealing. But many are. Todoist has bridged that gap between high level functionality and elegant design.  The only fly in the ointment is the reminder and label input functions which seem buggy.,
"I would recommend a possibility setting a certain date so the event would start that day  and then it would go every day, for example, i want to learn german and french in holidays but i cant set the date on ,,everyday,, bcs i dont have time for it now, thus i want to start in upcoming month. Thank you",
"I tried so many to-do apps that never really helped me but this one is really awesome ; the way you view the upcoming days means you never miss something coming ; creating a task is intuitive on a whole new level with emoji supported labels and priorities. karma is nice because points 💯. It changed the way I plan stuff to do now I actually have fun doing it. Totally worth the subscription, high quality app 👊",
"I still can't get the app to notify me from the sounds I pick on my Samsung Note 5, how do I solve this problem",
Couple of things though for better functionality.  When moving something to a different folder a window comes up to where u want to move it to but with that said there should be create a new folder button on the popular just like how Google Drive has and if u want to place it under the main title.,
"I work a lot from my calendar and like to see appointments and todos in the same place. Loved the way it worked with Sunrise Calendar before Sunrise was taken over by Microsoft. Interaction with Google Calendar (or other calendars that work through Google Calendar) is not so slick. Tasks completed in Todoist do not show up as complete in these calendars. Incomplete tasks do not get carried forward. Synchronization seems to work only in one direction - from Todoist to Google.  I understand these issues have to do with the Google API (or lack of API), but the usefulness of the app for me has been diminished.",
I'm a developer and an entrepreneur. I own and read a book on productivity called Lifehackers Guide to working faster and smarter. This is the ONLY task app (and I've tried everything form Gmail Hacks to google wave and slack and this is it),
"Worth every dollar of the yearly  subscription. Cannot recommend highly enough. Meets every need I have, with a well designed and thoughtful material design update. Option to switch to old input option would be nice as typing is not always convenient or practical. I love the theme options and animations, so much attention and love not just a dumb port. Worth the wait. Third party integrations and api support, combined with so many platforms makes my life perfect!",
"I really like how clean it is and the best part is adding ""at 5 pm"" and the scheduler auto adds the time. Another thing is the todoist app is everywhere! One of my fav is the Firefox extension with full functionality of the app not just a list, where i can quickly add or tick off from list when i need to. Double Thumbs up!!!",
"I had the pro version then didn't renew because it was too tedious to manage from my phone. Now that there's a Web option, I'm happy to come back.",
"I use todoist everyday and it works quite well. I really like all the shortcuts available and the fact that the dev actually listena to users when deciding where to go next. Todoist is just enough of everything, but not too much of anything to works extremely well for me.",
Synch with 15+ platforms? Can't even see what platforms it synchs with. App description gives a few examples. Thought I'd download it to see what else. Nowhere in app does it say so. Just says upgrade to Synch with 15+ platforms. Great! So you want me to pay close to $50 just to see if you will Synch with a specific platform? No thanks. Uninstalled. *UPDATE* 1. So you expect me to go to website for info on a mobile app? 2. Hard to find. And then only 13 platforms. 3. It is $44.99 per year. Still BS.,
"I've used so many to do apps. Todoist rates among the best and it syncing with Google calendar, ifffit, and Evernote simplifies things for me. I just have to figure out how to use ""projects"" without all of them showing up every day. Great app.",
"I've been using Todoist for a while now and think it's great! However, I keep running into walls when wanting to use certain key (to do app) features, like setting reminders. There are too many features that are only available for premium subscription holders. There are certainly more feature-rich apps for cheaper and so I'll be switching soon.   I would've continued to use Todoist if I only had to pay a one time price for access to all the features; freemium is such a tease!",
"The basic version does not allow you to set dates for your items, so there is no way to see what tasks are coming up. So it's pretty much just a way to make lists of items.",
"I am not a very organised person but ToDoist definitely made me one. It's so much easier to remember things because it's easy to use and a reminder will pop up and tell you what to do for the day. The only thing is that you have to pay 28.99 for a year, but it's better than it sounds because I did the math you only have to pay a bit over 2 dollars a month. The only way to get reminders is paying but it's totally worth it and it's not just reminders there are lots of other features. This app is for everyone.",
"I love how this app works compared to other to-do list apps. It really helps me stay on track! The best thing about it, is its shareability. Because you can share your lists, this is a very good family shopping list app, if you're looking for one.",
"I like how this app has the ability to synchronized between multiple users. I've used this with building grocery list between my wife and I. Still haven't figured it out completely, but I'm looking forward to learning. Thank you so much guys!",
"This app works. It's not going to help you plan your entire life goals, but it WILL help you organise yourself before a flight, make sure you don't forget any shopping, or get everything ready for a birthday party. I think the app is very good for those sort of things. And I find it really annoying to see things go overdue. It encourages me to want to complete it!",
"I've only had this app for a few hours, but can attest, it is top notch. Does so much more than I expected. Combines several different features I thought I would have to utilize via multiple apps.",
It's really just a list if you can't add labels. You can add labels & comments if you pay $30 per year membership. So for me this is a bad app. At least let me try it with full features. I have tried Remember the Milk and they have all features for $30 but let me try for free.,
"Often i used to forget my tasks which i was supposed to do during the day or which i'd be supposed to do in future, but this app solves that problem. 1 star less because they are providing very limited features in the free version of the app.",
"I'm curious on how to integrate this more into my life, but am not always able to (so 4 stars). For university it was excellent. I'm curious if there could be a trial of pro before purchasing to make a sure decision! Thanks!",
"Sure it will allow you to make lists but charging €13.99 to set an actual alarm/reminder, that's gouging... such a basic function deprived by a pay wall. Shame! Sure go ahead and charge for the multiple users accessing the same list... that would make sense but locking us out of functionality is a good way to get people to drop your app like a hot potato for being utterly useless....",
"Easy to use, helps me keep track of things I want/ need to get done and it's fun.",
Like any application you need to be clear with yourself on how you are going to use it and be prepared to adapt. Took me a few months to get the hang of it for my work follow. Can not imagine work without it now.,
"Liking the app so far. ( 2 weeks in) But for some reason I'm having difficulty setting up the reminders via phonethe phone. They are very easy to program, but simply dont show up. The only time I got one was in a test scenario where  I set it up for 2 minutes after... Any clues ?",
"Todoist is amazingly well done to-do list app. Helps me keep track of little (like when a TV show season starts) and big things (some work notes), as well as all the things in between.",
"And makes me do what I said I would do! Only gripe is it doesn't seem to want to tell me what I have achieved by way of tasks completed today. Only tasks completed in individual projects. Real kama is how you feel when satisfied with a day well spent, not what an algorithm tells you you should feel.",
"Seems like everything I tried to do in the app required a yearly subscription, even setting deadlines for things, ridiculous. Not only that, it sends about 4 emails a day about your to-do list, in my case all these emails for the one test entry I made before uninstalling, totally excessive. There's better actually free apps out there. If your willing to pay a yearly fee it's probably a good app, but I have enough paid subscriptions as it is!",
"This app helps me stay organized in so many ways. I especially like the plug in in Microsoft Outlook that allows a person to create a Todo by right clicking on the message. The way I do this allows me to operate with a ""zero inbox.""",
"Everything's neat and straightforward. I like how it's set up easily. Not much else to say on it really, I recommend it",
Calendars were never my thing. Todoist is exactly what I have been missing for so many years.,
"I'm on the go a lot, physically and mentally. Todoist keeps me on track. Just wish I could remember to open it everyday.",
This has been the best digital app for managing my projects and tasks. Keeps my head clear from worries about forgetting stuff. Easy to use and simple to navigate.,
I like this app because it's simple and to the point. It gives me a friendly reminder to start my day off and then I get things done. This app definitely delivered what it promise.,
"I have use this Tool for a while. So, far it's does what I need. I have found a problem once in awhile. It may be due to my error. It has all the must do list.",
"I love this app so much. It has helped me get through school and with any other task that I needed to be reminded about. Highly recommend it if you have a bad memory like me, haha",
"I have this app on my desktop, phone and tablet and it has helped me so much! My time management has improved so much since I've started using this app. It's a must have for people with time management issues .",
"I have only used this app for a few days, but it seems to be very good and thorough especially with the attachment to email.",
"Seems to be what I was looking for, just a straight forward reminder list. It does a lot more than I need it to, but you are able to turn things on and off as you like. No problems.",
"Only extra thing I'd like to see is list templates. This would be a template where you can add a bunch of pre defined tasks to a date such as a ""packing for holiday""  checklist or ""backup procedure""  checklist etc.",
"It takes a little bit getting used to but once you learn how to navigate, pretty easy :)",
"I just downloaded and am now going to uninstall. It seems like a good app, until you want to set an alarm for a task, or enter comments, and discover that's only available for the PREMIUM version -- which costs you $29. And not just to buy it... that's the cost PER YEAR! Screw that, no checklist app is worth that",
"Sends my reminders, I definitely get more things done.... I like that  I can still see my list of things to accomplish,  and if I couldn't get to it,  it still reminds me...definitely better than old school carrying around a tab of paper",
I really enjoy all the free features. I don't know if I want to buy it though because I can't try all the features.  I wish I could try all the features before buying.,
"Works perfectly. I wish I had a check box on mobile like I do on the site for checking things off, but otherwise Todosit nailed it.",
"Used to use OI shopping list for quick lists, but this is obviously better due to cloud syncing and more robut options.",
"Good to-do app, but the widget is frustrating and wastes a lot of click able area. Very very annoyed that the widget cannot be compressed to a width of 2. Uninstalled, but I would reinstall and pay $5-10 for a better UI.",
I really love this thing. I used to have little notes to myself all over the place. I installed this on my phone and my Win7 PC. They are automatically hooked together so any changes made anywhere show up everywhere! One of the most clever features is the auto detection of priority and due date in context of the entered task.  Not to mention the daily email reminder of what you've scheduled for yourself that day.,
I really like this particularly the integration with zapier that send it to idonethis so I can keep track for monthly reporting.  The only improvement would be to be able to set you default project as I have to move them all.,
Sometimes moving list can be tricky from one day to next.  It will jump two days but only once in a while,
Works really well. I'm now so much better at tracking all my to do's,
"Once you get used to the interface, the app is intuitive, and certainly helps organize your day. It runs on all devices too. Very happy ☺ with it.",
"Great for repetitive & nonrepetative tasks.  Very easy to have multi level projects & group by priority.  Synchronizes among PC, tablet, & mobile phone.",
Now I can manage all my task efficiently. Nice material design.  Would like to suggest for the widget to have an option to change color to transparent.,
"Todoist is one app I rely upon daily to keep me on track with long-term and short-term projects, as well as specific and repeating tasks.  I love the ease of scheduling recurring tasks.  Syncing to all my devices is essential, and is handled beautifully.",
"It's a keeper, tho I would like to see more options for items/due dates etc. I.E. I was trying to make a weekly notice for taking my trash cans out to the curb but on Wednesday and it was Thursday...everytime I tried to make it weekly it changed it to Thursdays. This means I have to wait till next Wednesday to actually change it to a weekly chore. So, does that mean if I make a monthly errand I have to also create it on the day of the month I want it to repeat (or at least wait till that day to edit it)?",
I love having the widget on my main screen so I can very quickly check what are the next few things on my to-do list. Works great!,
Adjust the rate in which the active login sensors are scanning for new and active logins. Adjust facial security camera filters and focus. Once these two issues are resolved I will read examine the app and give it a fair rating.,
"I deleted the app and reinstalled the latest version. In the few hours I have used it since, I haven't experiences any crashes like I experienced with the previous versions. I'll keep looking out for any other issues as well. Thanks.",
Helps remind me what needs to be done and I end up feeling a little guilty when I don't follow through. Nice clean interface.,
Todoist has really helped me keep track of the things I need to get done. Everything has worked well and I would recommend it to anyone.,
"The app is helping me get organized. My only issue is that I need a way to go straight into editing from creation, so I can link the task with the project.",
It helps you track  and manage all the to do tasks with ease and on various platforms.,
"I have completed over 5000 tasks but my karma level didn't update 2 month's ago, solve it.",
This is a wonderful organizational app. It keeps me on track and the reminders kind if guilt me into getting things done.  Highly recommended.,
"I hardly do these.  This app is worth it though.  I've tried several task apps, and this one just works.  Simple or complex as you want it to be, brilliant design and I get things done.",
This had been a great tool that I used to rely on my calendar for which was not the right tool. This is.,
Flexible simple dependable.  Organize  personal and work tasks. Got professional version and use most of its features.  Still trying to figure out how to use geotagging efficiently.,
The GPS alerts is okay nut would be more udeful for me if they were able to alert further than 100 meters.,
"It creates a good work flow for teams. Usually generic to do lists are just for personal use. And I'd rather write it down. But with this, I can work with my team",
This awesome app helps me to keep my mind empty. Thanks to this i have never bees no productive bebore. Great storage for random ideas too!,
"Good. But a little bit not easy to set on tomorrow's things to do. It can be a problem of interface, I think. Anyway thanks for good app. I am enjoying it :)",
One of the best project and lost management tools I've used. It's exceptionally helpful that is available on multiple platforms.,
"Easy to use... BTW, could you change the icon of save button. It looks like send button on Gmail. That makes me confused.",
"Prior to discovering Todoist, I used to try to keep everything on a calendar. Todoist has a remarkably easy to use but sophisticated interface. Everything can be organized based on topic and priority and can be divided into minitasks.",
The free version offers just the right features. I'm considering purchasing paid version. This is an amazing to do list app,
"Helps me get stuff done and keeps things organized. The widget is a bit buggy though, won't let me add tasks from the widget, have you enter the app.",
"It's a fine program but they spam the hell out of my email. I installed it thinking that it would be a simple little planner, and it is, but they've sent me 12 emails in 2 days and not one of those emails has anything to do with my list.",
"I've used many to do apps in the past,  but todoist is the one I stuck on to. You guys have done an awesome job with the mobile Web and Mac apps.",
Very user friendly and very Quick/ convenient for creating tasks and sends reminders on mobile as well as email.  Good work indeed,
I am not a detail oriented person. I forget things and events a lot. Todoist helps me stay organized and it has helped me immensely!,
"Pleasant interface, the way the app understands dates automatically is cool (though sometimes frustrating), easy to learn, and the online support is terrific. Still getting the hang of it (I'm moving from Any.do, which still wins on the beauty stakes, though).",
Looked through many todo apps but finally got what I wanted. This app really makes me do stuff.,
"Very easy to use not very complicated, very applicable to day to day living whether you are a young student or a very busy professional.",
"The application is ok, easy to use but it missed basical functions, as reminders-&gt;you get them only with the paid version. I stopped using it.",
"Easy to use. How things are labeled by project and some other minutiae are a bit wonky and the free version doesn't allow descriptions of events but besides that, it's easy to use.",
"Its not flashy, its no complicated, but still brilliant. Im still learning its features but love it all the same",
I've been able to get all these tasks out of my head. The user interface is on point and very well written. We'll worth the price for premium.,
Nice app that has more features that I'm still learning to use. It's great for my busy schedule,
Really good organizer and versatile. I love how it lets me rearrange my tasks easily so I can keep a working plan every day.,
"Among the to do list apps I've tried, this is literally the easiest yet advanced. Complete, clean and easy-to-use UI. Really love the feature for occurence tasks",
"No-nonsense, gives me a nice space to write my tasks down, schedule and organise into sub-tasks.",
I think that any to do list should have a reminder and it's WAY too expensive to buy the full version.,
"The features of this list are what makes me prefer this app over other to-do list apps. No fuss, chronological, and easy to sort.",
This app is doing well but in Windows phones cortana will do all these even for reminders I don't need to pay $23 per year,
"Features that are free with other to do apps, like reminders, are not in this app. You must pay to upgrade for basic features.",
"Love this app. Seriously it is a struggle to keep with a todo list, however I don't find that problem with this one. Great minimal design and just overall great app.",
"The UI is very clean and not distracting. I like the intuitive intelligent where it understands when i type ""every week day"" :D",
The only todo app that I have actually kept using to keep me organized. Great interface. Let's me quickly record tasks and then get back to work as quickly as possible.,
"Does the job for me. With some motivational features, it could be better. Almost like Xbox achievements- for productivity",
"The commenting feature itself was a deal breaker. I'm never gonna pay that much h for such a small feature, when I can easily get it on any other alternative app for free",
I have been looking for better applications and methods to track actions and increase productivity. Working with this for two days now and I like it so far...,
Useful for organizing your task over the day. Clean and minimal UI with multiple platforms support. Labels and reminders are powerful but you need to pay in order to use it.,
I looked around for a to-do app and I couldn't find anything better than this app.,
Just started this week but I think we will get along just fine. Will go to 5 stars once I get the hang of the program.,
Great well thought out app. Needs a more compact UI option; gets a little cluttered with many tasks.,
"Great app and the lockscreen widgets are awesome for organizing multiple lists. Only suggestion would be to allow new tasks to be added to the top of a given list, instead of being thrown down to the bottom.",
"Gets the job done and better, I'm a really big fan of their text prediction (i.e. typing ""dinner on Friday"" makes a task on the upcoming Friday).",
"I've got so much more done and I'm only a week in, couldn't recommend it more. Looking forward to grabbing the full version the moment I can afford it.",
"I've never seen a task manager tool like this, that does not get in your way. Todoist is simple, yet very powerful.",
This is hands down the best app for organizing on the market. Would be four stars because the pro version is 30 dollars a year... but the fact that you can share lists with coworkers is amazing. Someday I hope it syncs with Google calendar. That would give me an organizingasm,
"Good app, I like all the built-in features for reminders, nice interface. They should add a calender. 4 stars for a gr8 app",
It would be cool if they could have more free Todoist premium give outs but otherwise it's good,
Please add sync button to app because my offline changes aren't synchronized until I do some action online.,
Easy interface and great that is syncs across multiple devices.  I Love subtasks.  I never understood why other apps make you pay for it.,
"If you're in sales this app is a must for following up on leads, setting appointments, remembering projects with deadlines for customers and just all around Organization.",
I've used it for two years now. It's minimalist and help me record and clear my tasks daily.,
I can honestly say that my productivity would hover around ZERO if not for this app,
"Tried a few other task manager apps. Clean interface, Gmail compatibility all work rather well. Minimal bugs",
It's an app made in heaven. It made my work so much easier. I don't miss any work to do anymore and always make my deadlines. I definitely recommend this app.,
"A lot of features to get head around at first. After that indispensible , love the filters and labels makes life easy. Works accross all my tools pc, tablet and phone. I use it for everything from investment portfolio management to personel shopping it's like a third eye",
"This app is great, I find myself being more productive when I get a reminder to complete a task. Also stops me forgetting stuff I need to do",
"Incredibly simple to use and blazing fast. Perfect user interface for a hand held device. Beautiful GUI, that is professional, and pleasing to look at every time you use it. And the app has enough basic functionality to make it worth while for every day use. The paid version has even more functionality that would be a bonus for advanced users, or team projects.",
"Switching from an iPhone to Android, the one thing I was really missing was OmniFocus. I searched a lot of alternatives but they all lacked something. This app comes closest to OmniFocus. I absolutely love it!",
"Great app for organization.  Works well with ""getting things done"" system.  My life is much more organized because of todoist!",
Lacks key GTD features like next action support. And start dates. But it's fine for most things and most people.,
"I like the functionality and interaction. Tasks are easy to set, link to projects, move around. Timing can be shifted effortlessly. Notifications make the tasks present and somehow motivate me to address them. Thank you !",
There are a few improvements that could be made but better than anything else or there.,
Free version is almost useless.otherwise i would have rated it 5 stars. You must be aware of hidden advanced hidden features to enjoy full potential,
"This is my favorite reminder app. It has a clean uncluttered interface, and is very easy to use. I decided to get a subscription, which provides additional features.",
"So far meeting my needs to help me remember all the little things that often slip my mind.  It's on me to remember to put stuff in, but once in it serves as a constant reminder.",
This app has the rare combination of power and simplicity.  It can be used in a complex and meaningful fashion and offer ease of use at the same time.  I'm glad I found this app.,
One of the most effective productivity apps I've tried. I have terrible memory so this is really what I need. I can't believe it's free!,
This is a solid app. It doesn't complicate things and is fairly intuitive. Learning how to use the various features came naturally just by playing around with different types of reminders,
"A little less than intuitive at first, but is awesome once you get the hang of the shortcuts.",
"Best to do app for my needs, super simple interface and very easy to keep organised",
Have been using this since the beginning of this year. I have been using it every single day and can't live without it👍👍,
Great to do list! Many I've used overcomplicated things while others are too basic but this has a perfect balance. Lots of extra features if you look them up too.,
"This is the wonderful effort of the team Todoist.  Although, I would recommend to buy the full version to explore its extreme potential.",
"I've used several apps that serve a similar purpose. This is definitely my favorite. The interface is so simple, and it allows me to organize my lists as I need to.",
Like how you just remember and type the stuff in and tick it off the list as you get things done. Easy to use and practical.,
Good app but it tries too hard in some ways and not enough in others. Not every list should need to be a project.,
I love todolist! Making my life so much easier. I've seen one tiny glitch once but that's it.,
"The dread is always that great apps like this, apps that we embed in our lives, that we rely on, get seduced by bigger fish, change out of recognition and abandon their users. Please be different. Stay. Thanks",
"Perhaps free version could have a little more features, but it's OK enough for basic tasks. Different modes do help out more than normal old google and android apps",
Just a little clunky and working your way through the menus takes a little effort.,
If you're looking for an app that will keep you coming back for more then this is the app you are looking for.. I've tried almost all of the todo apps on the play store and todoist is the oje i most perfer.,
"The interface is nice, but with this free version you cannot set remainders or add labels... there are lots of apps that do that for free",
Very useful app. No complaints. Helps me to stay organized and not lose track of tasks I need to complete.,
Would give 5 stars if I could mark tasks as complete from my Huawei smart watch. Was a really handy feature of another to do app I used.,
The latest features really make a difference for adding a task quickly. Project sharing is a breeze compared with using email.,
"This is a simple, elegant tool to help you implement the getting things done system in the form of a to-do list with amazing flexibility and utility.",
"You need to put time into setting up your system, but after this it's a portable reminder of what you want to do, available smoothly across multiple devices and browsers etc.",
"I tried many, but this one is the best task manager. Simple and minimalist. The most complicated feature is the greatest (input complex recurring events by writing). The way it should be.",
"Great tool for helping to keep track of things to do, be it at home or at work.",
Simplest app to implement GTD David Allen's organizing system. Great also if you'-e never heard of him.,
"I love the categories and how easy it is to associate tasks, edit due dates, and set up repeating tasks. Best work app I've used yet!",
Very few apps are able to build a service that performs equally well across platforms. This is one of them. Excellent Android app that helps you stay focused.,
The only complaint I have is their are a lot of good features behind their pay wall.,
"Todoist is great in that it allows you to prioritize and organize really well. I love how well the computer and phone versions work together. The daily reminders of what I need to do are nice, too",
"Good app, highly recommend. I was using excel, then switched to wunderlist, then this. This one's really nice for its simplicity and strong calendar / time settings",
"I'm all about to do lists on paper, so it's nice to have an app on my phone rather than forgetting which notepad I last wrote it.",
Helps me to remember the important tasks.  This is a great help for someone over 65 y.o.,
Productivity at its best! Easy to use and love its organization. Excellent reminders and a great way to get your crazy life under control. I have 3 going boys and am homeschooling so this tool is vital!,
"Couldn't be easier to use this at whatever intensity works for you. Quick to add tasks and set up deadlines, priority, then filter based on your own inputs.",
Free version very usable. Was able to quickly get up to speed with a small cross border cross platform team for no spend. Only feature I miss is to add a duration e.g. 2 hour long task so zapier could zap to calendar e.g. meetings.,
"Honestly one of the most useful apps out there. After I incorporated it into my daily routine, I found it to be one of the best productivity tools I had.",
Makes organization easy. I do wish there was a way to remove the daily or weekly thing since I just keep a general to do list usually,
"I am an all over the place person, and this app was given to me by my wife, and all I can say, ""if ts not written here, I will never t do it"" lol",
"The minimalistic look with powerful functionality makes this my favorite productivity app. It's one of the first apps I install on every phone, tablet, and computer I obtain. Constant improvements and updates, excellent customer service, and innovative approach makes this company and product one of the best.",
Needed something to help be more productive with my time and this app helps a lot. Use it to organise work study and home life,
"Exactly what I wanted, have to get premium for it to be worth it but excellent excellent app (after trying many alternatives)",
"Even the most important feature of a todo list is missing and requires pro, such as reminders,  useless piece of software",
"Love this app.  Love the notes, karma, etc.   It keeps me focused on what I need to get done.  Helps me manage my work and personal life.",
It is good but I wish it was free although if it had any ads pokign out it would look HORRIBLE. it organises my day pretty well I am very forgetful and this helps me remember very well.,
Awesome for organizing and planning but I kinda wish they would put maybe like times during the day instead of just the days.,
The free version has no functionality. Lot of freeware give better features. Uninstalling it.,
"I love it, Todoist allows me to keep on track of my scheduled tasks at work and see what I need to do; and what I've completed, it's incredibly effective and efficient.",
"Keeps track of everything i have to do and sends me morning reminders. I use it to remind myself to pay bills on time and to motivate me to do the daily routine. The only improvements I would like to see is color coded priorities and to make task input a little more intuitive. All in all, great app though.",
"I like this one. It's pretty comprehensive and practical, however the day to day items at a little hard to navigate.",
"This app is  just gorgeous, I can't even think of spending my day without it.",
I've tried a ton of to-do apps and this one has the best number of free features that I need and great support for all platforms. It also looks great.,
This is one of the finest app for any device or platform. Very easy to manage todos in different projects. Also has great interface and sync facility....,
Love todoist. It's great to use and does what I need.  There are some features that would make it 5 start but I'm not composing.  The app is great.,
"Keep is better for making to do lists, hands down. Uninstalling this",
Started using the Windows app and now I'm using this as well. The sync is flawless and everything works smoothly. This is a great service and a great app on both android and windows. Great job devs!,
"Really good app, it's helping me plan out my days very effectively. I run a small business, and it's invaluable. The free options are more than sufficient to get you started. I particularly love the repeatable tasks and how you quickly you can type in tasks, where it recognises the day of the week and inputs that independently. Fantastic!",
"Useful, stylish and very helpful. You can set the tasks only for a day or you can pick a date and time for it. You can postpone the tasks really easy. Love it!",
"Putting reminders as a premium feature is a bit silly, it's such a basic and fundamental feature of a to-do list. Without reminders it's useless, and users pay for extra improved features, not core functionality. The annual cost for premium app is ridiculously overpriced for what is essentially a list manager.",
"New UI that conforms to Android standards is kinda clunky. Super easy to add simple tasks, but worse to add complex ones with schedules and priorities.",
Tried to use for a large paper. Would have been much more helpful if it held me accountable for missing deadlines!,
Has always been great but even better with the Material Design update. Really love the new branding too. Many more functions than Wunderlist but at 3/5 the price. Love the ability to recognize dates and time when entered and the deeper integration with IF.,
"Thoughtfully designed, well integrated, and actually making a meaningful impact on my life. Helps me to stay organized, and I do believe that I'm more productive as a result of using this product.",
"Tried a few to do lists and always com back to todoist,  great integration  with Outlook,  cloud mail, ifttt  and many more,  as well as a stand alone app",
Best to-do manager I've tried so far. Filters are great. Only complaint would be that inputs and setting reminders can be a little unintuitive at times.,
I find I get things done with this because of its simplicity and ability to at minimum link to Gmail and Evernote for more info. I get done what I needed to get done faster and can get others the info they needed faster.,
"It's better than any other ""get things done"" app out there.",
"My favorite productivity app out there! I sprang for the paid version and wasn't disappointed, but I think many people will have amazing success with the free version! My only desire is to have the labels feature available on the Windows 10 app so that all of my info crosses onto all of the platforms I use.",
Undoubtedly it's one of those app which will definitely make u a organised person! Good job team.,
I have used this for years and love that you can share lists between accounts and that the website and the app work so awesome.,
"Once you create a task, you can't assign or move it to any category or a filter.",
Works well and makes sure you dont forget those important tasks.,
New user. Possible going to try pro. Not happy about the yearly renewal. Will keep looking awile for a all out purchase with this format.,
Easy to use.  Gets things out of my head so I can get things done.,
"Best todo-app I know, and I've tried a lot.  Great interface, flawless syncing, and all the functionality I need without becoming overwhelming.",
I used to use paper everyday for my tasks but now kinda addicted to todoist and manage all the tasks digitally. Helps me to prioritise the major tasks and I make sure they are done.,
This is the first to do list that I have clicked with and am using consistency. Super easy to use with lot of great features and I am only using the free version. Looking forward to exploring more of the features and functionality.  Thanks to the developers of todolist for making this app available - Good Karma for you!,
Been using todoist for 2 years now.  Seamless Co op between mobile and pc. Recommended!,
Used everyday to remind me when I'm slacking on being productive.,
This is a really well thought out time management application. I highly recommend it to others.,
"Overall a good app, for the following reasons: * clean design * fast and responsive UI * you can quickly add new tasks (requires a bit of learning) * pricing is imho reasonable * support seems to be good  some missing improvements: * app ALWAYS runs in the background (e.g. wunderlist only runs on device wakeup and from time to time) * not possible to add reminders by typing (e.g. ""do dishes remind tomorrow"")",
I am a full time teacher and student. This app helps me stay organized. I love the email alerts.,
"Todoist is flexible enough to handle my complex scheduling, and has helped me stay on top of my many projects.  The afirmation that Im done at the end of the day is perfect! ❤",
"I use lists daily and this app makes it streamlined and easy for me to create, edit, and share in real time with my friends and family",
Easy to use. I have not unleashed all the functions yet but great so far,
Use this app. Check out some systems online. Start with the smallest manageable system that helps you getting things done. Go with paid once you need to expand your system. Good luck and have fun!,
Just this one more feature is what I'm missing badly- the ability to add labels in bulk and the ability to move multiple items to a different project,
This app is intuitive and easy to use. They have a great system in keeping you on track with what you want to accomplish. I recommend this app over the other to do list apps for its simplicity and intuitive interface.,
"It's to pricey to buy,  but I didn't need the extra features anyway.",
"I like the idea behind the app. It has helped me so much, I just punch in what I have to do and it does remind me! It's my greatest help",
It will be perfect if it features report for reviewing what I've done,
Good app easy to use. I recommend this to anyone who needs reminders and likes to scrawl to do lists but looses them.,
Not 5 stars because it guilt tripped me into leaving a rating.,
Nice app helpfull and very useful but i just completly hate the premium for money.,
It connects to every device I have seamlessly.  Even has a calendar app connection so I see my todoist tasks on my calendar.  Wonderful and easy!,
Helped me grow my productivity. I can't see how it could be improved.,
It would be great if I could delete projects I'm done with without having to buy that possibility.,
Invest some time to organize this gorgeous task-manager app. You'll see the results immediately. Todoist have everything you can want from a taskmanager. Premium worth the price for sure!,
This is a great reminder app. I use it for daily work tasks that keep me on track all day.,
"I love it. Honestly, it's the best task list app I've seen. It is very simple to use and it reminds me every day of what I have to do, regardless of due date.",
"One of the apps I cannot live without. Clean design, support on multiple platforms, easy task entry, reminders based on time or location. It is excellent.",
"Clean look, easy to navigate, and has any feature I could hope for.  I use this app exclusively for my to do lists. It's easy to set and change deadlines, and organize your thoughts. But my favorite aspect is the flagging, so I always know what's most important at a glance.  I'd be lost with this app for sure",
I have been using this app for the last two years. It has everything that you might need to boost your productivity. I highly recommend Todoist for anyone wanting to achieve more every day.,
I run a business and a life with my husband and To-Doist helps us stay organized and in sync. We love it.,
Great task manager. It certainly helps keep me organized and on task. Without it I'm sure I'd forget what I need to get done. I like the integration between phone and desktop. Unfortunately they no longer support Thunderbird.,
"Been using the site for a while, the phone app only made me even more productive! A must have.",
Does what it says very well. Reminds me of tasks every morning so I can plan to accommodate those tasks comfortably.,
I needed an app that would help me keep up with things I needed to do for my accounts. This app is so easy to used. It helps remind me of things I need to take care of for my customers,
Very user friendly on mobile ap and pc. Just using in linear format right now but very helpful!!,
Beautiful UI and does a good job. It will be great if main task also has a due date and as subtasks are completed show a % completion of main tasks.,
Very pleased with this app.  Really helps me keep all the little loose ends together.,
Useful tool to get things done by organising and managing your task list.,
Todoist is extremely useful to stay organized and this app is amazingly well built. It has been worth every penny!,
Its the most simple and neat Things to do list I found. Thanks. I am loving it.,
I upgraded to pro. It made the great app even greater. I use it every day and it helps me keep my lists all in 1 place. Seriously amazing.,
"Very useful app with many interesting functions. It's going to take a little time ""playing"" with it to see all it can do.",
Most of the cool features are disabled unless you buy the annual subscription for $28 a year. A little more than I was looking for.,
"Excellent app, need to be able to use it with more than five emails/people. We use it for business inventory",
"Very easy to use. Can type '2nd Saturday in May' and it will add dates, times etc. Easy to mark items as complete. Great to do lost app",
U will start seeing changes in ur life once u use this app. Its like everday u get up and check what needs to be accomplished,
"Enjoying the app. Having an issue where I can't have two widgets at once on my home screens. They work for a while, then start rapidly blinking. Not sure why. Maybe it's an N issue on my N5X? Please check it out. No star reduction since I'm on a beta OS for now.",
This is my favorite organizer after trying several others. Easy to use and to share. Keeps you and your loved ones on the same page.,
"Developers have done an amazing job with this app, seamless between all platforms and greatly increasing my productivity",
"So accessible, easy, user-friendly and helpful. Do yourself a favor and get this app right now!",
"One of the better to do apps I've come across. It has a web extension, you can collaborate with others, and the interface is easy to pick up.",
"I use this app for everything. Organizing tasks into projects helps me keep track of work tasks, homework, home improvement, bills, groceries, appointments...everything. The app is so universal.",
"Todoist is simply best task manager I've found, and I've tried nearly all of them . It allows one to quickly add tasks, track them in an organized manner, and it's available across all commonly used platforms",
"Not overwhelming. Has great features, but not so many that you can't handle the possibilities. Perfectly balanced app!",
"With the help of Todoist, even an average Joe can become a guru of productivity. Shape and mold your to do system to work for you.",
"It's nice, auto gentle reminders and it's smart enough to register certain key terms, such as daily, weekly etc. Only wish I wouldn't get emails as a secondary reminders, that's a bit of a nuisance.",
My life is going with todoist. If I have not todoist I cant achieve my job promo n something. This app very useful,
"It just works for me.   I like the daily  digest,  the ease of adding and changing a task,  the consistency in use experience between mobile and desktop.  Try it out...a clear front runner.",
This is a great app to keep a rolling to do list on. I have been using for a month and found zero bugs. It's well-designed with the end user in mind.,
Very useful getting things done. Plan your entire day with determined focus,
Makes you pay for an alarm on your tasks which is unfortunate but great app otherwise,
Started using this app strictly to track actionable items. I'm using the system laid out by Tim Challies in Do More Better. Highly recommended!,
"Quite a nice streamlined to-do list app, allows you to categories tasks into subtasks, or sub-folders, perfect for organising schoolwork. Occasional bugs, but works across both android and apple devices and usually functions totally fine.",
"It's great for complex projects/tasks. However, it could be better with task  details. It forces you to create multiple entries instead of providing a checklist at the task level. It's  overkill for a simple task with a few steps.",
"A fantastic multi-platform to-do list with simple and very functional features. Desktop, Android, iOS syncing is seamless.",
Not really intuitive but once you get the hang of it it has really kept me on track with work and personal projects.,
So easy to use. It has brought order to my life! I especially like the invite/share function. Highly recommended.,
Didn't explore the entire but happy to the extent used,
"It's only been a week but I'm already more organized. Update: been using this for months now and I can't go back. Too easy to stay organized. I literally never forget anything I have to do now, I just choose not to do it.",
"Great to do list, but it's still not as user friendly as it could potentially be. A bit clunky, even.",
Not 5 stars due to the limitations (necessity to buy the premium version). In my opinion there are basic features that are blocked for this reason.,
"This app has helped me organise my chaotic work into projects. Getting all the information in one place that isnt my brain has had a huge, positive impact on my day to day life",
Keeps me on track especially coz I'm a person who needs lists to remember everything I need to do for the day.,
"The app works well, but it sends me daily emails. I turned off notifications, but I wanted those on my phone so it would remind me of what I needed to do.",
"Amazing app! Premium is perfect for GTD use.  Developers - When i hit the back button on my Android, it quits the app. It kills me every time. At least give me a warning - ""touch back button again to exit app"" or something.",
It's a great app and I use it pretty much every day. Though the paid version of the app is a little much.,
Just has every important feature with a clean usable interface.,
Nothing comes close to managing your tasks.. Am into productivity and GTD! Simply love todoist.,
"Tried couple of to do list, and this is the best. Omni focus is good but not available for android.",
Easily move due dates around and get notifications that aren't over bearing.,
It's great if it played an alarm when you set a time to something,
Great app.  Too bad it doesn't work on my Windows 7 computer.,
"I am an employee, business owner, husband, and father of 4. Could not do life without this app!",
"Finally a running list at my fingertips at all times, work, home, cell across all platforms. No more posits and cumbersome notebooks. Love love love",
Helps me get things done. It's a great productivity app.,
"I love this app, I only really look at the Next 7 Days and use the rest of the tabs to add tasks to my week. I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because a ""Move to"" other folders option would make this app run smoother.",
Was recommended by Tim Challies in the book 'Do More Better' and am happy have gone with it- it's an intuitive and very well designed app. Very helpful!,
"Interfaces greatly with other apps, mail, etc.",
"Great app if you're like me and end up with multiple to do lists on scraps of paper. Keeps everything in one place, linked to your phone. Easy to use. Love it",
"This app is pretty minimalistic, but it still has some cool features. My favorite is the ability to share your list with anyone. Good app, especially for those of us who are trying to keep our heads out of the clouds.",
"Very nice,  and easy to use. It's definitely helping me sort out my activities better. Great job.",
"An easy to-do app where I can categorise my tasks and see them per day, perfect for me!",
"Only downside is that for someone like me, the pro version is expensive for seemingly vital functions. Otherwise, great app!",
"Can't even change it's notification options, so many issues with this app",
I use Todoist with time sensitive items following the GTD method. Works great for what I need.,
"This app is so simple to use. I love that I don't have to take a lot of time figuring out how to use it. Yet, it still meets all of my needs for being quick, simple, and organized.  Thank you for delivering to your consumers!",
"Bad. Too difficult to understand. Kept taking over functions I was using. Keep it 4 PC,s use",
"I look forward to striking something off from todoist after I've done it, sort of serves as motivation at times.",
"No app can make you stop procrastinating, but this helps keep me focused anyway.",
Very nice app. Well designed UX. The Chrome app is very helpfull as I have all my tasks and task tools one click away.,
Love it. Gives notification of listed tasks so u don't forget until u check them off,
"This one piece is a Swiss Army Knife to do everything for your to-do list. Fantastically schedule, mark priority, labels and whatnot without leaving the text box!",
"The best feature is how it transforms title inputs into dates and other infos automatically.  Also the sync works perfectly as I switch between Windows laptop, phone and tablet constantly, it's fast and stable.",
"I really enjoy how easy this app is to use. As well as how integrated it is with all of my devices (pc, phone, watch, browsers). Thank you for producing such a wonderful task management experience.",
I like its ease of use and functionality. Have tried many To Do apps and this is the best,
The best project and task manager I've found. Once you start to understand how best to use labels and filters there's no stopping you!,
Does what I want/need without a bunch of unnecessary extras.  Still a new user but I'm thinking this will be the app to stick with.,
Helps me keep in track and if I forgot to write it down it's good to have a back up,
"Its great! I can separate my to do list from things i need to do today, to things i need to do next month. Linking it with a gmail is also really handy if you forget things often (like myself)",
"$30+/year for premium seems steep, but it's a great app",
"Easy to use, worth through upgrade for reminders, easily sync across multiple devices.",
Absolutely love it does what it says on the tin. Well not tin but you know what I mean,
"App is a great help and benefit and if it were able to integrate with calendar apps, or, have an internal calendar itself then that would be the ultimate. Otherwise, any user is stuck using *2* separate apps.",
Best GTD app in existence. I have superhuman powers of productivity and effectiveness thanks in part to Todoist. Definitely get and use. BOOM.,
Love this app. It is easy to use and does everything i need. I particularly like the support for hierarchy and scheduling.,
So that says something.  Only other app I pay for regularly is Evernote.,
Great to do list app with an uncluttered interface that lets you choose between different categories (like shopping and events). You can also add your own categories. Five stars from me!,
I hate apps that have NO helpful information. I have been trying for the last hour to find how to set a recurring task. Nowhere to be found! No help. Nothing! How ridiculous!,
"Awesome, easy, colorful, handy, access from phone, tablet, computer... can add people to tasks... I LOVE IT and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!! The team is SUPER FRIENDLY, kind, understanding, they get back to you super fast and they are generous. They are amazing souls, rare gem nowadays. You'll feel like you joined your new loving family who REALLY CARES for you.",
"I love this app because it's *always there*. No matter when I remember some random thing I need to do, I can put it in here right away. Then, later I can assign it a day and such. But I won't forget! Thanks Todoist!",
Planners and other kinds of things for productivity never really helped me until I started using Todoist. Thank you!,
Good at nagging me until I do something,
Functions like it's supposed to. Real simple and clean. Might help to have more flexibility in the due dates such as a task being due repeatedly on specified times everyday during the day. Or an option to read the list of the app's language through my phone?,
Waste i dont like it because u should mention about the premium first itself,
Too many clicks to change due date,
Premium rate is too pricey for me though,
Could use a few more features like locking to do list in the notification bar and setting times to be notified of tasks but great app over all.,
"Nice complement to the website app, works well online and in airplane mode too :D",
"If you are want to be productive this is app will help. I like the reminders, they really help me out.",
To easy work. But some time  cannot understand work .,
"I like the interface and cross-platform functionality. I also like the ""karma"" feature. But only the most basic functionality is available in the free version, which I find irksome.",
"Keeps my items in my face, allows me to reschedule, and it's quick and easy to record what there is.",
Love this app! Helps keep me organized. Great job syncing across all platforms and the integration with both Gmail and Outlook is awesome. Easily the best to do list app out there!,
"The price is the only reason for a 4* rating, the app itself is great.",
With todoist I have a place to be all of the things I do and need to do. Seeing everything organized and later out decluters my mind and motivates me,
I've tried loads of task manager tools & ToDoist has been the best by far. There are a few features I'd still love to see... a week planner in paneled calendar view 😃... but very happy overall. Highly recommend.,
I like the design of the app. It is very clean which is nice. You can also set exact times.,
Easy/simple to use and stops me forgetting stuff. Perfect.,
I've tried a number of To Do apps and this is by far the best ... and it keeps getting better with every update!,
"It's a great app, but I can't set reminders with out paying $30 bucks a year? I get paying for all the interconnect stuff and sync.  But I can't set the an in app remind alarm What good is that?",
"This app is what I've been looking for. When a task comes to mind, it only takes a second to add it. Helps me remember what I need to do.  Especially love when I'm driving,  I can ask Google to write a Note and it saves it in Todoist.",
I want to share onlycertain tasks or subtasks with my team. Where they could only tick of those tasks,
Constantly let's me know what I'm procrastinating,
Too many bugs in desktop app. I think I had enough.,
So simple yet so exhaustive. That's what I like about the app. Did I also Mention it's inviting,
"If it worked it would be great, but daily tasks disappear and re appear randomly, which defeats the purpose entirely.",
"In my opinion, in 'Projects' tab, i have a shared project. The problem is, if i add a task, the other person can't see the task i added, only if check the 'Projects' tab. I think it's because of the 'no due date'. I would make a setting for users like me that when adding a task to that project group, the date should automaticaly change to 'today'. I didn't saw any 'email us' section, so i wrote down here..",
I like the clean interface and the intelligent date recognition.  Would give it 5 stars if the context recognition could work like Google inbox reminders,
"I love the features this has, but you need the pro version to get reminders of your tasks and that costs $29 per year, which is too steep a price for me.",
I don't usually give feedback but this App helps me 😝,
Helps keep track of all those little and not so little things you might forget.,
"Latest(2021) I have never used it on my newer phones, I bought ACalendar+ and aCalTasks+. Old review (2016) Just seems that it's not really intuitive, to me. Also the notifications come as an email, it's set for 9am London time, but the damn things have been turning up at 06:20.",
I love the fact that everything is saved even completed tasks with all the comments and attachments. I can always review what's been done and retrieve information commented on the tasks. Smart dates is really smart. I don't have to touch multiple buttons to set my reminders. Just type everything. Paid for premium.. Really worth it. Wish there's option to change the font size or view page. Would like to view more on my phone screen.,
"I use this for everything, from listing items I need to get at the grocery store, to managing work projects. It's great for all of them!",
"I've even been able to create recurring to-do's! For ex.: ""Every Sunday do 'chore/etc.'"" And it pops up in my notifications which is also much more helpful than me having to access the app myself to even be notified of the to-do. As long as I have my phone, I'm reminded.",
"Wow, the app is brilliant and is a constant reminder for me to keep being productive.",
Neat little app look forward to further investigation!,
Great app! Love being able to access it on all of my devices. Very good user interface,
"It ia effective, integrates into google apps easily, and the ""karma"" aspect ia strangely encouraging.  It works!",
Why should I buy paid version for simple reminder,
I needed a tool to make sure my staff does the work I assign. Todoist allows me to assign tasks and is a record of assigned tasks with status updates. Makes my life so much easier.,
... most of the good stuff is in the free version.  Sure I am going to click the upgrade button at some point.,
Wish they would give u a few more options on the free versions however it's near 2 perfect 4 me. Love it paired w the IFTTT app thanks plz keep improving and giving us single moms out there as much help as u can w out that extra charge!! Awesome app!!!!!,
Kids will have no difficulty using this app. Very handy for the memory-challenged!,
It went straight to 90% downloaded then 100% probably 3 seconds later,
"Tried other to do apps but, can't find  any that beat Todoist.",
"Wish free version had alarm reminders, but other than that Love how quick, easy, and the optional constant ""quick add task"" icon!!!",
I believe Todoist is the best so far. I've tried them all or so. I'm comparing the premium versions of course.,
Last year Premium membership was £18.00 on your website or £18.50 via Playstore. This year Premium membership is £21.99. Why such an increase? Inflation is not 22% but your price rise is! What will membership be next year?  Time to move on.,
"As a Realtor for over 20 years, I have used dozens of planning systems. This is the best personal list I have used.",
Nice app that lets u maintain ur task list. Absolutely love it's simplicity,
Can't imagine life without it. Keeps me on task.,
I m such a forgetful person but this app is simply amazing it helps me with my day to day work al I Hv to do it note it down here. I m loving it,
Great app which will be soon kill by microsoft - are guys there insane? You spend a lot of money for awesom calendar and now you killing it ...,
Only 4 stars since i couldn't find a way to sync with my google calendar,
Free features are great. Would like the paid features but probably won't buy it,
I use the app everyday on my phone. It's incredibly easy to use and keeps me on track.,
Not had it long but already bought a year of the full version. Fantastic organiser.,
"Excuse me, is there any way to change the app's language? Is Spanish available? Will put 5 stars if posible. 4 if at least I get any feedback. Thank you very much!",
But the free version has to many restrictions,
I Like that it's there when you swipe down and you can note that thought right when you think it.,
"12-11-14 Been almost 2 full months, and i can say i am hooked. Jib well done developers!10-23-14 Gonna go pro tomorrow. Hope it is worth it!   10-28-14 Five days in and I'm hooked.  Worth it $29 for a year!",
The best part about todoist is ita simplicity which makes it easier to use is consistently.,
Tried many of these types of apps and this is the best most feature full app of them all.,
Keeps me on track without being annoying,
Love it. Helps you implement and continue the GTD system. Syncs across multiple platforms.,
"It could be the best. Without discussion. But, reminders just in paid version? That's the most important feature for every app like this one. It's kind of sad, the rest of the app is just perfect.",
Extremely useful but unobtrusive to do list. Suits my workflow almost perfectly.,
"Easy to use from my phone, tablet and the website. Help organize my to do's.",
Recurring task depending on completion of other task! Otherwise great!!,
Not sure where I would be without Todist. It does exactly what I need from a to do list...,
Keeps me on top of things that pop up,
As a stay at home mom with endless tasks and things to remember this program has helped me straighten out my priorities and give me much needed focus. Thanks!!,
"I'm really enjoying the free version of this app. I'd love to be able to use some of the premium features, but $26 annually is too steep for a to do list, or any app really! Still, the free version does all that I need it to.",
"Thanks, you did a good job by which I have a better organized life. :) . I have a comment, may u add an option for the customer to write his own motivating words next to the karma score? . Thanks",
It really keeps me on top of things and is always emailing me to do something.,
This app really help me complete stuff I totally forgot about !,
"From 5 Stars to 1 Star: Why did you remove ""Multi line input"" in Android? Now how can I make lists or points or one by one serial numbered tasks? Please reply me with a correct solution other than your Sorry. Please",
"I love it! Helps me organize, sends me reminders and is easy to use.",
Very useful application to remind you you planned work meeting and other schedules.,
Bestt app without it I would forget alot of stufff,
This is awesome for keeping track of my assignments and homework. Keep up the good work! 👍,
"Very good app, very reliable and easy to use and on all devices. Great job!",
Nice apo but am uninstalling it for spamming my email with my schedule that i can clearly see on the apps widget in my homescreen! And whats more i cant disable those emails,
I have a hard time living without my Todoist... Especially with my ADHD.,
"I've used pretty much all of The To Do List apps, and I'm convinced that this one is the best. What do you guys think?",
"This AP works. So far so good. Still learning all its,features .",
Helps to get things done. Payed subscription worth it.,
"Well designed interface. Works seamlessly across my Android, iPad, and PCs.",
Best I've used so far.,
Absolutely best to-do list app! Love the option to set up different projects and ability to use it on many platforms. A must have!,
I've tried a few to-do applications and a lot of them are good but this has got to be my favorite! The interface is clean and easy to navigate through. It never feels cluttered. It's quick to add new tasks and reschedule them. You can also add the deadlines just by typing them in with the task itself. It automatically detects it for you. The project management feature is good as well and it comes with the Free version! This app definitely increased my productivity 🤓,
"Having used it on my laptop, it's a great app for getting through busy schedules.",
Easy to keep track of daily chores,
Don't know what I would do without it!,
"Simple, straight forward. Easy to use from pc or phone. Just what i need.",
I enjoy being able to switch so easily between all the devices I need to check this on.,

"For me, it's the best way to keep track of my to dos.",
But where is the list of the things that are done... just to check,
It's a simply the best to-do app for me. Many thanks for developers,

At first I thought it was rather absurd to have an app for something a pencil and paper could accomplish. However I have seen a marked rise in what I am able to get done by using this app to keep myself organized,
"The interface is so simple, and the different features keep organized and motivated.",
Now I enjoy checking phone to check what my task in my jobless day in order. Thanks!,
"Very helpful app, I would give it 5 stars if it had a small alarm. Otherwise, this is an amazing app and I love it!",
Easy to use and great for only being the free version!,

This app has helped me manage a lot of stuff and I'm forever grateful.,
"Intuitive, easy to use and gets your task in front of you, so you just do it!",

"Easily and hands down best to do list ever, shut up and try it fool.",
"Would have liked more features but it's free, can't complain.",
"Only been a couple days, but I'm hoping I can sticks with it.",
Very useful as you can check list of things to do both on phone and your laptop,
There isn't enough of a preview of what it would be like with the full version,
Awesome app that really helps me keep my ministry duties and personal life organized! Premium well worth the cost but free version is great too! Highly recommended!,
"Compared to some other services, it holds back on features it can offer for free",
"This service offers nothing that Wunderlist doesn't already provide and for NO COST. Why would I pay for the most basic feature of a todo app (reminders, attachments, etc)?",
Simple and clean interface! It contains all features I need! I can manage my daily activities easily!,
Great app. Easy to use. Our family's choice #1 for organising day to day life.,
I wish I had the opportunity to keep the projects bar open instead of it automatically being closed when I open the app.,
Makes it easy to organise and gives reminders for task undone,
"I wish it had a list function, so I could create a grocery list or supply list.",
It needs more robust formating in notes - lists and numbering.,
Todoist helps me keep work and personal tasks in order and on track. Love it!,
"It is organizing my crazy life well! The only problem is I think they need a ""just didn't get s#! $ done"" section.",
If theres an option to turn off notifications from email that'd be great,

I don't care what it does... charging $40 per year that rises based on exchange rates?  This is a very bad trend and I will never support subscription based apps!,
"Lots of fun, quick to enter new tasks, integrated well across platforms",
Great app. Simpler UI would be a bonus. And maybe a tick list,
Google calender does it for free... Rest the app is awesome,

やりたいこととやらなきゃいけないことがハッキリするから時間を上手く使えるようになるし良い。システマチックなんだけど割りとちゃんと可愛くて予定立てるのが楽しいです。〆切管理とかも出来る。カレンダー系のアプリよりも良いと思えたTodoリスト系はこのアプリだけだと思います重宝してます。,

"It does everything you want it to but sometimes you have to guess things like shortcuts (drag right to mark a task done, left to reschedule) or the fact that you can schedule repeating tasks. A tutorial would go a long way but the interface is so user friendly that if you have experience with these kinds of apps you can intuit a few things.",
"Great app. Love integration with IFTTT. I have it tied to my Amazon Alexa, so when I add a to-do item verbally it shows up in my Todoist list! Still on free version, but might consider paying for it if it becomes my go-to app for list maintenance.",
"It's the weekend and I can finally take my wife to the movies, only we forget that movie that we saw in the coming attractions ast the last movie we went to that we HAD to go see. Or I finish reading War and Peace and I'm ready to start the NY Times new best selling political history book, only I forget the title. Well never again! With Todoist I keep track of movies I want to see, books I want to read, projects my wife wants me to do, restaurants I want to try, funny quotes from my breakfast club.",
"This app and the desktop version are essential to my daily life.  While there are a few additional features I wish were available on the desktop and web versions, the Android app is perfection.  One wish for Android: an option for a dark theme. Thanks Todoist!    UPDATE:  I need start dates on non-recurring tasks. While I still love Todoist, I switched to Remember the Milk just because I must have start dates.  Implement start dates on non-recurring tasks and I'll come back, Todoist!",
"Due to years of pushing myself to sleep too little, I have a terrible memory.  I am new to this app but finding it awesome so far.  Karma makes it a game and the score makes it competitive.  I installed the app on my android, the chrome extension and the add-in to my work outlook at work as well as the windows 10 links at home and at work.  ONENOTE FOR WORK AND EVERNOTE FOR PERSONAL for files makes this supercharge my brains potential to get things done...",
"U can keep it in sync using phone and Chrome browser. Just disable some nagging notifications and u are set.    Annoyance: you write something like May 6 or 8Pm (any date/time) and it wants to tag or make it in a sort of due date.time.. Stop that please ?   Otherwise, recommended.",
Extremely well done. Been using it for a few years. Makes creating systems very easy. Could have a couple more features but they already have a ton so I'm not really gonna hold them accountable for that.,
"I was looking for a a good all-in-one calendar and to do app. I did research before selecting this over the other Google recommended one. After playing with it for 20 min I'm not impressed. None of these apps have any way to plan beyond a week. If they do, the interface isn't user friendly. I have little difficulty remembering my week. It's beyond that where I need help. Delete.",
"I have executive functioning issues and Todoist has been by far the best app for me. I use it to organize all my varying projects and use labels to create a hierarchy for individual tasks to keep me focused and on schedule. The widget's customization makes sure I can't forget my task list and again, is great for helping me stay on topic. It has exactly what I need but is lightweight enough to be immediate and super easy to work with. Works perfectly on both my Android devices and my Macbook. Literally the best app I could have. Thank you, Doist!",
"I paid for full after a day or so playing with it, and am well happy. Also, impressive support with replyable email contact. Finally, my system is perfect(ish)! Update - lived with it for a good while now and it just gets better - tbh I forget it's even there, it's just how I gtd without having to over think it! xo",
"This is a good app. It makes my life a little easier by remembering things I could forget easily. I think it's a little over priced at $28 a year, but probably at the end of this 1st year I'll have changed my mind.",
I really enjoy the ease of use of this application. It's very user-friendly and has made prioritizing my tasks much easier. As far as keeping you on track it's also an awesome tool to use. I love that it sends you reminders when you submitted a project to be done at a certain time and you haven't completed or put in that you've completed it so it reminds you to either get started or 2 mark it as completed. LOL overall great app!,
"Still has some bugs with respect to the web app. Particularly we're unable to select ""no due date"" for certain things i.e. books to read",
"So far, I am keeping up with my tasks; my bouts of organization usually last a week, but the cross-platform client is giving me more staying power.",
I have tried so many to do apps. I have to say this one is the best its simple yet it has all the functions I need.,
I wish I could rate this app higher. It couldn't be better and has helped me loads,
"... but I cannot for the life of me get the reminders or notifications to work in this app. And yes, I've turned notifications on within the app and given permission in settings but they still don't work. I turned off my third-party lock screen too, but nothing works.  Very disappointed. Not much point in a to-do list that can't notify me of anything. I'd like my money back please.",
I'm so disorganized and this helps me so much to keep track I of stuff to be done in an easy access app. Love it.,
Great app. Have installed Todoist for Windows now. Only thing it doesn't recognize dates properly. The 7th of April will be the 4th of July. I would like to see this bug fixed for Todoist for Windows.,
Find that this app has helped me be more organised and is quite easy to use. Like that I can reorder tasks through dragging.,
"Easy to navigate and do exactly what I've been searching for a to-do list app to do. Haven't gotten into the premium features or sharing, but the basic functions and layout are nice.",
"Great simple app that is easily accessible and user friendly across all platforms. I haven't figured out how to receive text reminders yet, despite trying several times, maybe this could process be improved",
This is by far the best To-do list application I have ever used. The user interface is simple and intuitive to use.,
"It is a really simple and great to do list app, with great features like intuitive date and time setting. I wish I would be able to assign one task to multiple people. Otherwise even the free version is plenty good for everyday life.",
"I have compared several task apps and found it's the best of the kind. Versatile functionality, elegant layout and easy to use.",
The Definitive Productivity Tool  I have been using the premium for about a month now and believe me when i say this . Todoist + Google Calendar can work magic for you :),
"It's simple, free, and I use it. Well done for not irritating me with adds to make me buy it. I may even pay for the full version.",
uninstalling. .. for free one they could have provided few features other than adding and deleting the task. Even for adding simple comments it's required to upgrade.  Never install such apps,
"The app has a excellent design, but the usability can be better. Some actions require too many clicks and there is some bugs in labels using the website",
"Very simple to use, but has all the needed items. I had tried many to do app before, never satisfied like this",
"Todoist does all what I expect it to and then some. And it integrates well with my fav calendar app Sunrise. Finally, finally a to-do app that does not leave me disappointed.",
"I use todoiat for daily cleaning tasks, personal reminders and business todos. It syncs flawlessly across all my devices and has every option ive looked for yet.",
"Definitely love this app.  It makes it so easy to manage simple tasks, or just needing to add an item in a rush so I won't forget later on.   It's definitely saved me more than once with work and my wife!",
I love having all lists in one place and checking things off.,
"I'm pretty bad at managing my time, this app is great. The way it works across different devices and formats is a real win. Well worth subscribing to get the premium version.",
I tried a number of apps and Todoist is the best for many reasons. Try it fir a month or a single project and you won't regret it,
"All around intelligent and efficient to do list app. Available on any platform, truly can work for anyone anywhere.",
"I needed something that would allow me to track tasks on multiple devices and platforms, and to share tasks with others. Todoist has been great for that. I'm still learning features and how to use them, but so far Todoist has been a great help with getting organized and improving productivity.",
This app offers so much to help organize life. Makes it easier with the paid version but you can still use it all the time with the free version.,
"This app is great, very easy to use and has helped me stream line my task management at home and work.",
I used to manage my daily goals here quite simply. This is very helpful app.,
"You'll get my 5th star when you combine location and time based reminders. As it stands now, I either forego location reminders or get them even when the due date is days away. Overall though looks like a fine product with great potential.",
The notifications are not too much like other apps. Very easy to use and gave a sense of accomplishment when completing tasks with their level system.,
Integration with email app cloud magic works very well. Nice and simple way to hold all your to do list at one place.,
Its nice to compile daily lists with and voice recognition of event dates and times is just what i needed.,
Top notch tool for organizing tasks. Google calendar integration is good and will be great when synchronization happens faster.,
"Great integration with other devices / platforms. Powerful task manager, great logic engine for recurring tasks and for scheduling. Great app.",
"As a chronic procrastinator, this app has helped boost my productivity considerably !",
I use it daily to keep myself organized and avoid procrastination. Easy to use and convenient. Love it.,
"Easy to use, neat, nifty and pretty feature packed with all the right bits and pieces. Love the natural language recognition. One of the best task managers for both Android and iOS. But I wished they packed more for free. Even basic functionality requires a premium upgrade.",
"The best taks app have ever owned! And I have had many. The damn thing works like I want it to, across all the devices I use!",
"Pretty neat app, buuuuuut the USEFUL features are restricted to premium, which is worth mentioning that it is almost $30 a year! Way too much for what it offers. That may sound cheap but it's not worth it. Uninstalled.",
My whole life ison todoist. Work and personal. The only big feature I'd like would be the ability to put in task durations.,
It us a good way of keeping track of your to do's and it is satisfying to tick them off but why oh why does it not recognise Priority mode of Android? If the app is not set to be a priority app it should not make noises when the phone is in priority mode!,
I usually have that one thing I forgot to do and this helps avoid that,
It's just a list without upgrading to premium. I didn't see in an easy way to repeat items.,
"It's nice to have an app with decent subtasks,  priority, and sorting. Wish the widget was better at smart adding tasks into the right list /day /priority like the PC and Mac client is.",
Womp womp.,
"Works beautifully. Except, these notifications that occasionally don't bother notifying me.",
Its so useful.You can never miss any important task.,
"This app is EXACTLY what I've been looking for! I'm a single mom. I'm in school. I work multiple jobs, and I just started my own business. This app helps me prioritize with ease. And I love how I'm able to collaborate with my graphic designer via our shared project. I use it to ""remind"" my sons of what the need to handle too! My mom always said I was a good supervisor. I think this app was built just for me! Lol",
"I love this app, it certainly enables me to stay on top of all my daily dutiez",
I really like the simplicity and functionality of this app. It's really cool and keeps you on flick.,
Thoughtfully created programme and app. This is the best task management programme I have ever come across.,
"I use this every day for all my tasks. Work, study and home. It's so easy to manage. Works perfectly",
I love todoist for personal management. Also it's a perfect fit to track with toggl,
"Excellent, easy to use, email feedback helps keep me on task. I am getting more done now than ever before!",
Great to do list app.  Use the shared list regularly.  Simple as shopping or errand list or for simple project management.,
Best app to organize task as an executive assistant to 3 c-level executives.,
"Interface is a bit finicky at times, but overall covers my needs.",
A really useful tool and app works well.  Running on Android 6 with no issues and very stable.,
Like tje sub categories. Would like to be able toreuse items. (say for a grocery list),
When will you have your power app and Evernote integration sorted currently using a third party app to do this. This would make this an awesome app and definitely then worth 5 stars,
Works great cross-platform. Android version is flawless.  I pay for premium; it's well worth it.,
"All I wanted was a simple to-do list app, got so much more.",
Productivity booster,
Easy to use and very helpful. Please add feature to move list from one category to another.,
"The simple design speaks volumes for its complex functionality and style. Thank you, Todoist, for making my life easier AND a little more eco-friendly!",
Would give 5 stars if more things were included in free version!,
After I got this app I started to get more organized with my to do list.,
"This is the best to-do list application I've used so far in years.  I only wish the paid version weren't as costly, but totally grateful the free version has no ads!",
Simple elegant and focussed on getting things done!,
How effective any application is going to be for any user depends upon how well that particular app syncs with each user individually. Now all users use gadgets differently. I use these task mgmt apps for reminders. Atleast give a 3-day trial period so that I can make sure how well it syncs with my way of managing an application. Even a paid one-week trial would do. I m in india. 1800 rupees is spmething. With no idea how the reminder function works.. I csnt go ahead!! Sorry!,
It's been terribly helpful to me,
Fantastic application that helps me organize my everyday life that I simply couldn't live without!,
"Love this app, has helped me get organized so much!",
"Superb app, it's completely changed the way I organise my work!",
Super helpful app. Really helps me stay productive and track my weeks productivity,
"Amazing UI, great functionality. Happily paying for premium.",
Todoist is great. Would it be possible to be able to set a duration for a task and not be one hour by default? Thanks and keep up the good work!,
"Love it! Use it all the time, really helps keep my life organized.",
"Just what the doctor would order to get things in order, and get them done...",
"Fantastic app, well worth the subscription!",
Not even google can beat this app. Amazing,
The perfect app to keep track of a zillion things,
Best personal task manager I've used so far.,
Love it so far.  Would like an easier way to delete tasks however,
Works as advertised. Really keeps me on track.,
Needs work!!!include recurring note possibly!!!! Per day. Also need to sync with Google. Tasks!!!!  Also no feedback option so u can't email them. Also how do u remove all completed apps???? Once it's been dome it's still there,
"Almost complete , still missing one functionality : task duration",
Neatly organized thanks tho the app. Great design ..,
This app has been very useful. I have recommended it others already,
"Guys, it's totally awesome! The best I've ever seen",
Syncing todoist with IFTT and Google calendar makes remembering events and tasks simple. Thanks!,
Just what I was looking for to write down quick to-dos or ideas during the day :) Great app!,
Great app to help you remember your daily tasks.,
"No bugs at all, runs smoothly, and has helped me navigate my day!!",
Great for keeping organised and remembering what I have to do,
Best task tracking app I ever used,
An invaluable app that I use in my business and for my personal tasks,
"I use it every day. It's simple, and I love the notifications.",
Now you can note and check very simple,
A great app that can turn out to be your personal secretary,
I'm liking it.,
Yayyy!  No more paper lists.,
"Have been using any.do for a couple of years. This seems to be way more better, kudos!",
Love the ability to access my list on my phone and laptop!,
Still learning how's to use it.,
Make it so my lists refresh automatically across devices,
Very well thought out and functions awesomely!,
It's a great app.  It has all the options of the website.  It's great for teamwork.,
Use on a daily basis for work. Essential app.,
"Have it on Windows, Android, Outlook, Chrome. Works great everywhere.",
Unless you pay and upgrade to premium. Uninstall right away!,
Love it. Please continue to better it.,
"Simple, clean, useful...just the way I like it! Like the new material design",
Very good. Should put option for hourly reminders or timely,
Mobile and Web both function flawlessly.,
Love the IFTTT integration,
Very useful to handle my daily task. Quick task add... Quick check Mark.. And more. Thanks team.,
Finally found the to do list app that works for me.,

"Приложение красивое,интересное.но нет списка выполненных задач а без него любое планирование - не планирование, а черт знает что.",
Зручно!,
Todoist,
Ok,
Yes,
"I think by coincidence Todoist 9 was released on the same day I received a reminder to renew Premium. Of course I was already planning to renew, but seeing the new features definitely reinforced that wise decision. Somehow they have made the app more powerful while also making it faster. One of my favorites, by far. Happy to have it and use it everyday.",
In my opinion it's one of the To-do apps with the best free version.  Also it easily works cross platform so that no matter what device I'm using I've always my to do list up to date.,
The last two updates (so called material design) have disrupted the data entry process and the auto correct disallows you from use day/week/month descriptive text in your tasks.....very very frustrating.  And there is no override (like the check mark in most texting applications) This program used to be a 5 star application but it now takes me twice as long to enter and correct my entries.  Please address these issues and ask your user base what they want.  I am considering not renuing my premium subscripti,
"Great productivity suite. If you are comfortable with Outlook they this should be familiar. Organizing my tasks took a while to think of but the app helped me get it all out. The following day, what could have been very stressful ended up a breeze. Thanks Todoist! (I want to spread the word that your premium service was well worth it! ..and I don't usually write when I rate.:)",
"Hands down the best task app out there.   Intuitive, and easy to use with good integration into other apps that I use.  Latest update had pretty much everything else that I had wanted from this app like projects in the quick add function.   Nice work!",
You pay for basic functions. Free app is VERY basic. 1y subscription is twice the fee of Toodledo. Very limited features of free app compared to other apps.,
I love how simple it is to add and manage tasks in Todoist. It's also easy to postpone tasks to the next day. And I like the positive reinforcement of karma and calculation of daily streaks in completing tasks.,
"Although there have been times that I haven't liked some of the app's aesthetics, I haven't been able to deny the functional beauty of this app. It has always been a simple, clean app, whether on iPhone, Samsung Tab, Google Chrome or the website proper.",
I love this app. It's simple to use and has improved my work flow as well as the amount of what I can accomplish in a day,
"Nice design, fairly limited unpaid functionality. I'd change the 'send' icon to a tick on the event creation. Is a bit confusing",
basically moat of the features are locked and require premium upgrade. basic setting such as alarm/reminder should be free,
"My Note 4 was able to update this app just fine but on my Note 8.0, I press update, hit the accept button and absolutely nothing happens. It's been that way for days meanwhile I updated over a dozen other apps on the Note 8.0 with no issues. And I have a paid subscription.",
"No reminders unless you pay. I understand holding back on reoccurring reminders, but single time reminders is a little overboard.",
"So far I love it. I'm still learning how to use it. I like it's simplicity and functionality. As soon as I downloaded the app, my productivity visibly increased. I was accountable to the things I need to get done and I can teach how well I've kept up with those things.",
The app is clean and simple yet full of features and the ability to edit projects and change hierarchy is great. The premium plan was a great purchase.,
"Regular issues with syncing and errors with dates/time zones.  Solution provided is to clear cache... Hardly ideal when dealing with multiple users and platforms.   Minimal android updates (still cannot sort tasks by date due in android and no ability to search in a project.). On a wider scale, the removal of the todoist votebox has minimized user engagement.  Mac apps are nice but when will a chrome app with local notifications that I can actually use at work be developed?",
"I've only had this app for a week or so, but it's worked pretty well so far. The ability to nest tasks within folders within folders is great, as well as the ability to customize folders.",
Très pratique. Je recommande. Une petite suggestion cependant : pouvoir régler l'heure de la notification quotidienne serait parfait.,
I love this app. I use it in conjunction with the outlook add on. It keeps me super organized and accountable without wasting a bunch of time setting it up.,
"Preparation required, Dependencies, Actual date completed and Reasons columns would make Todoist complete and great. Hope you guys release an update soon incorporating these suggestions. Thank you.",
"Very impressed with the new features, this is definetly one of the best apps on android.",
There are apps that can do many of the same things FOR FREE.  A good presentation might have made me willing to spend a few dollars.  not 3p bucks for a year.  Disgusted with this greed here.,
I found it so overcomplicated to begin with but now I'm learning how to use it properly I'm starting to like it a lot.,
"I really like the free version for a basic to do list app, and it meets my expectations.",
When trying to open Completed Tasks in Karma. Premium account.,
"Does everything I need it to. Lacks a few of the more useful items on the ""free version"" because they are stuck behind the ""full version"".",
"I love this app. It really keeps me on top of things and let's me rest easy. I can put in new tasks whenever I want, so I never forget to do something on my to-do list! :)",
"As someone who requires a surrogate executive function, and who has tried many different to do/scheduling apps, I am finding this app to be one of the most helpful for me. I particularly like the ability to add sub-tasks to a larger task.",
"I'm not the biggest fan of to-do lists, as they tend to accumulate junk over time, but this app makes them easy to manage and I do seem to get more done.",
"Seems great for putting down tasks necessarily associated w a specific date/time, etc.,   but what if i need to write down just a simple note/idea/thought/memo that cannot be assigned to one particular day only ?  Wasn't able to this simple task within the app...",
"This app is simply the best, most useful, most beautiful task manager available. One of my favorite aspects of it is its cross-platform ability. Todoist is available on almost any OS/platform. I love Todoist and use it all the time. It's an easy recommendation to anyone.         Todoist is the only task manager I've used that makes me get stuff done.",
Using IFTT its a great service I love it it's soooo cool well done guys,
"Tried a lot over the years, this one is by and far the best out there. Very good as a free version, fantastic if you pay to get the advanced features.",
"And I tried them all... It has all the features one would expect, the premium plan is definitely affordable and the extra features are worth it. No complains for now.",
"While the free version of Todoist is more limited than the free version of Any.do, Todoist is much faster on my phone and the actions are more intuitive. The Todoist application in browser is also better optimized and more practical. If I end up buying either one, it will be Todoist.",
I like this application because it continues to remind you until u complete the tasks.,
Bonita e simples interface. Minimalista mas completo! Meu único incômodo foi com o fato dos lembretes serem um recurso Premium.,
The best productivity app available with great Outlook integration and access on every device.,
"My wife loves it. She can put my honey do list on and prioritize them too. Personally, I'm not fond of it, (I don't like list ) but it makes her happy.",
"It was missing some key functionality like sorting by dates but developers listened. Trust me, Todoist is worth the price!",
Wish I had discovered this 2 years ago! Makes things easy to organize and keep track of things long term.,
Unless you pay the substantial yearly fee for premium some very basic features are missing.,
"Plays well with a number of my other apps, especially Sunrise calendar and Amazon Echo.",
Used it to keep up with my activities so I know what I need to complete. Perfect for keeping myself accountable. I do wish it could notify me on the times that I set a note for (call Adam @ 5pm; Todoist alarms at 5pm). Thank you developers of Todoist.,
Can't really think of any other feature that needs to be added. Does a comprehensive Task Manager job for me.,
Very smoothly designed application. Letting me know discreetly without me forgetting about what I need to do throughout the day. Very busy and use my phone for everything ?  This is the app perfect for the stock Android look and feel.,
"This is one of my most used apps on Android. Great app, thoughtful design, excellent functionality.",
I like karma points. They provide motivation. Wish i could see done tasks for free,
"""Text Joseph at 8am tmrw""  And it knew what to do. Perfect app.",
Helps me to get things done and I think that is what it is supposed to do.,
Es imprescindible para un ritmo de vida profesional o estudiantil.,
New to this app and love it! Really helps to keep track of things you need to remember. Keeps you organized!,
"What works is great. But as others have said, basic functionality missing from free app (no reminders?) and $38 a year is a lot to pay for something that other apps offer for much less.",
It keeps me focused and on track!,
Brilliant app that is so simple to use but with all the features i require,
A personalized blog post on the todoist blog about seasons and getting started upped my productivity just when I needed it so rather than  just four stars this app rates five stars from me.,
Love this app and the latest update. Good speedy support if needed as well.,
One of the best task managers around.  Good looking and efficient.  Plus it's on every platform and syncs perfectly. Awesome Web and email clippers. My one wish is for faster priority editing on mobile.  It's easier on a desktop but on mobile it's 5 taps.,
Haven't explored every option. But works for what I need,
Easy to plan daily things but not well ahead.,
Fantastic app!!! It does everything I need.  A must have for any GTD enthusiast! The Google/Gmail integration is perfect!,
"I don't wanna pay, that's all",
Easy to use and helpful. No trouble with crashing.,
"I love being able to assign tasks from a to do list, communicate with the assigned person to answer questions or notate the work finished with my work colleagues. The ease of making a family project to keep track of lists besides groceries and gifts lists, but big pirchase goals. Some of my favorite features is the Karama points, which makes completing tasks even more satisfying. The email alerts, suggestions and daily digest is an awesome reminder without being too pushy. Love this app. A mist have!",
I love this app and readily upgraded to premium within three days of downloading it to enjoy it fully.,
"A no frills, feature packed app.  That delivers.  Keep it up",
A week in and so far fantastic. Far better than Trello.,
The best I've ever used. Free service covers all I need for now. No ads. Perfect.,
It's very easy to use and it helps for planning your tasks with other people.,
Love it. And love that it connects to my browser at work.,
Allows me to fully categorize Mt to dos.,
"I wish it didnt email me. Other than that, I love it.",
The perfect app for busy people on the go.,
Love this apps!,
I started to use it recently. Very practical and well thought. Only positive feedback so far.,
All what I need to manage my tasks simply and easilly.,
A good mix of performance and practically useful,
"It's so worth it! With all of its integrations, widgets and power, I love it.",
Bought a year cuz I like it so far,
"Need to upgrade to premium just to get reminders? Really? If that's the case, I'd rather use a basic note taking app than this.",
Keeps me on track and focused on what matters.,
Excellent app to manage tasks...especially reoccurring ones,
"Best app to schedule my daily activity, love it!",
useless app - no reminders!,
The app nagged me into rating it,
Spoiled. How can I now manage anything without Todoist?!,
Limited without purchasing. Expensive,
Great tool for organizing and tracking tasks.  I use it for home and work.,
"Great design, awesome features.",
Clean with enough functionality to use for a variety of tasks.,
So handy and easy to use . Do recommend,
Meets ALL my needs.,
Looks interesting but needs sign-up to work,
Using it all the time to plan business etc,
With Todoist I better manage my tasks.,
"Pretty good, supports GTD well",
Very nice but  need the history to feel the process !,
It's available everywhere,
Its a great app.keeps me on track,
Great app helps you to stay on track,
Easy to use and contains subtasks,
Keep it up,
Great app! Helps keep track of what needs to get done....,
What kind of task management app requires a subscription for reminders? Better options out there for free...,
Reminders are the basics of a to do app,
So recomended,
But notifications not working,
But huge  scope for improvements,
Just perfect,
You cannot set reminders without premium. For me that means uninstalling for something free.,
"Great app, super helping",
Really efficient organizational tool.,
The best to-do app I've ever had 💪❤,
It's very easy to use.,
Love this app!!,
Best to-do app!,
annoying,
Best app for GTD users... EVER!,
Really love it :),
Great app!,
Great app!,
Not simple enough,
Absolutely marvelous.,
Best todo app.,
Keeps getting better!,
"Love it, need it...",
Good job,
Very helpful,
Awesome task manager,
Essential,
Have to pay to just add comments ? Come on!,
Ow do to do 👍,
Love it,
Nice app,
I love it,
Great app,
Good application,
useful,
Amazing,
Удобно,
"I only miss a semi transparent widget, I like to see my wallpaper",
The app is amazing. BUT.. reminder notification is a premier feature?,
But unfortunately I share OmniFocus in apple's family plan... So I have to give it up. But I do love Todoist. But it sometimes makes me crazy with all those tasks coming after you. In OmniFocus you can defer or simply hide something not available now.,
"This app gets it. Has everything you need to be organized, and access to everything everywhere you need it. I use it specifically with the gmail plugin and chrome app on OSX, and Android app on a Nexus 5X. Never an issue with keeping everything in sync. Being a project manager that deals with a lot of software that manages projects and tasks, and has been exposed to a number of task managers, ToDoist is still the app I continue to use because it just works. It's perfect for what I do.",
"I have tryed several different to-do programs and was about to give up. Then on a last try I download this program and was simply amazed. This does everything I was looking for. And much more. The fact that you can input a task on one android device and it will update all your other devices, is too good to be true. I have finally found a simple easy to use application. I would urge everyone to give this a try, you will be amazed.",
I am able to easily add new tasks and view my tasks.  Works consistently between the web site and the app.  The overdue and postpone features are handy.  It would be nice to have configurable lead in time based upon project or priority.  I.e. high priority starts to show up 4 days in advance.,
"A very functional app with very sleek and responsive interface. Absolutely loved premium features, shame it costs a lot now in Russia. Widget offers great functionality giving you ability to instantly add or manage tasks. 8 of 10 friends and colleagues on facebook use it too, so I would totally recommend it to anyone.",
"It's super convenient and efficient, but there's always a reoccuring bug that puts a negative on its productivity/efficiency. I use it as a widget and when I try to complete a task by tapping it, sometimes, the options do not come up on the bar. I have to open the app then complete it when I usually can just tap it done on the widget screen. Even when I go to the app to clear the task, the widget still shows the task. When I add a task, it doesn't appear. I've already tried removing and readding the widget.",
"I just started using ToDoist a few weeks ago, and now it's a huge part of my workflow. The organization structure of the app is fantastic and overall it's super useful. I wasn't terribly thrilled about having to pay money for a couple of the crucial features, but it is worth every penny. The way filters get created also sortof threw me off, but once you get used to the way their queries work, it's super easy.",
"Great app, could use a repeating dates feature I.e. Set a notification up for every Wednesday in a month other than that no issues p.s I think some of the issues raised in other comments have been adressed, so if they put you off check to make sure",
"I love the idea of todoist and the functionality provided, but sometimes I experience bugs where one part of the screen will get covered up by something else or pushed off the screen.  I've reported it once and was told it was told to use a work-around.  I'm not sure it has totally been resolved in all cases, but I appreciate the personalized response from support.",
Works well across all my devices and sync is absolutely flawless. Better handling of subtasks would be helpful. The auto date feature is more of a hindrance than a help. Great to be able to look back at completed tasks and the notes facility for a task is well implemented.,
I like the system. Very intuitive. You can have a full page on your phone...or not.  They have sort of karma point system...which i dont care about，but if you like giving purself motivational points then maybe it will be useful for you. The one thing i find missing is a recurrence option... I.e. if i know that i need to do something every 3 weeks... I have to separately put that in.,
"This one may seem better than most, but you still have to subscribe for basic to do list-esque things like reminders. I'm not paying 20 bucks a year so I can be reminded to do the things I need to do. I'll pay a one time fee for something like this (which feels like DLC), but I still won't like it.",
"I have used any.do before and while that is a good app, this app / service simply blows that away. I am much more productive using Todoist and simply cannot live without it. Paid for the premium service and never looked back, will definitely be renewing again and again. Keep it up guys!",
"I have been using it for almost two weeks and I notice I'm starting to get more things done. Start small, set dates and times, and don't worry if you can't make it all. If you want something done split it in small task and schedule it. Excellent tool.",
"Todoist has been helping me to be more productive by easily showing me what I need to get done in a day. It is easy to quickly postpone tasks in order to keep your list for the day manageable. Very slick interface and natural language parsing for task due dates. You can even do weird recurring events (every Tuesday, Thursday, sunday).",
"Using the premium version for a week now. Was previously using free version. I think it's a fantastic app, but only the premium version. Has lots of integrations (like with the CloudMagic email app, and a chrome desktop add-in). Very intuitive and seamless. Use Evernote for keeping reference material and a digitital file cabinet and use todoist to manage projects and tasks. Was previously using Asana, which is good for teams but a little clunky for individual users compared to todoist.",
"I've used this app for a while. I'm generally satisfied, but there is one thing that is really bugging me. Once I've completed a task, it disappears. I really want to be able to see tasks completed as well as tasks to do. I use the free version, but I can't see that paying for the pro version would make any difference. It's got the the point that I'm now looking for an alternative. And that's why I've downgraded my mark from 5 stars to 3.",
"This is one of the best list apps.  The screens are clearly laid out.  The interface is fast and intuitive.  I really like being able to prioritise my tasks and have priority flagged by colour.  The only changes I would suggest is that on entering new tasks, it would be better if it took you straight to the edit screen.  Also, being able to refer to dates in the subject line without automatically setting the task to that date.  But really, this is a great app, well worth a look.",
"Well designed, cross-platform app that is helping me gain a small sense of control over the things I have to do. This app stands apart from others in its ability to easily show what has been done (a critical element when used for business related activities).",
"This is the first to do list app that makes sense for my organizational style. Dig the recurring reminder (weird others don't offer this), plus the ability to integrate the app with other people is outstanding. I now have my boss trying it out for our company. Thanks for the Outlook add-in too. Keep the improvements coming!",
"It took a bit of time to get used to but now I love it. Learn the gestures for completing a task and how to move task to a different day and then the app is golden. Type in the day you want to put the task and p1, p2 etc to give it a priority on your list (out of 4). The karma rating in the emails are also kind of cool for tracking how productive you are at completing your tasks.",
"It has been a life saver for getting organized, especially at work. I love being able to create reoccurring tasks and not to have to rely on paper lists that get lost. And because it syncs across devices I don't have duplicate lists anymore either. Excellent app!",
"After trying a bunch of apps like this (including any.do, wunderlist, swipes), I chose this one for two simple reasons: it's good for teams, so you can assign tasks, and very good at scheduling, with the right level of obtrusion to make you more productive. IFTTT integration is also a remarkable plus for. If you need a little more features, you can try Producteev.",
"As ridiculous as it may sound for this app to be ""life changing"", it really has been lol. I have tried out a number of different programs to try and sync my calenders, tasks, etc. so that I would remember everything and be more organized between work and my personal life and nothing in my opinion has been so convenient. The ability to do what works best for you, combined with the simplicity of the app is why I love it. I could rant about it all day. Take a little time to really learn its capability,worth it",
"Don't listen to the bad reviews, give it a go, its simple, intuitive and really lifts the load of huge task backlogs. With various other apps to view your todoist tasks and Gmail integration even on the free version, it's the best task manager I've tried. Great for shared projects, and personal tasks, and and surprisingly good for shopping lists!",
"I've never been good at keeping lists, but this app helps me not only because it helps divide tasks into particular projects and gives prioritization ability, but also because it gives me points for completing things. I'm definitely more motivated when I can see my progress.",
"I'm a full time college student, and this app seriously has saved my life by helping me keep track of which assignments are due and what days/times they're due. I also love the cloud syncing of it, so that I can add tasks from my computer without having to worry about them not showing up on my phone. Two thumbs up!",
"Very easy to use app and extremely useful in keeping track of the different tasks I have during the day. One drawback which has to do with ToDo model in general is that tasks are perceived to be of interest on the day of use. However, often tasks require a considerable chunk of time to accomplish. Doing so requires looking ahead and although we can do this with ToDoist using reminders and the search bar, that methodology is not too user friendly. Better would be to have a countdown for specified tasks.",
"App has helped me a ton in staying organized and getting things done on time. Highly recommended. My only complaints are that scheduling a task for a specific date seems like it takes one or two steps too many, and the in-line parsing uses too common characters like hyphens. Features I'd like to see are pinned tasks for big tasks a few weeks in the future that I'd like to keep in the back of my mind, and the ability to apply a set of notifications to a label, instead of individually.",
"Haven't used the full paid app but not impressed at all with the ""demo"" of the free app. It doesn't even do the most basic things without asking you to pay.  I'd rather know what I'm paying for first thanks.",
"I had comments but Google play deleted my long responses, unprompted, twice. It boils down to reminders, $29 every stinking year just to unlock my much needed reminders, I don't need the other junk! Give me a $5 option for reminders only or something please! Otherwise. Great app in a very competitive market",
"I like the priority numbers we can assign to tasks. It wasn't easy for me to figure out right away, but within the day I got it. This new update is also very good. It is more straightforward now. I just would like it to be more straightforward to add subtasks while editing projects.",
"A bit more advanced and intuitive then Wunderlist! Pro version pricing is a bit steep however - even now more so! Maybe a middle pricing tier should be looked at, I don't use a lot of the pro features but just enough to make me purchase it. However $47 seems a lot of money for a years subscription (AUD)",
"I can get by with just the free version, but it's so awesome that I can't wait to see how well premium works for me. It's great to finally have a to do list with sub-tasks. I love the color coding options. I saw a previous review that said the app was ""life-changing."" I thought it was an obvious overstatement, but I completely get where this person was coming from now.  Having so many options to organize my thoughts has reduced my stress a lot over the last few days... And I'm still on the free version☺",
"This app has gotten so much better since the material design update, which led me to buy the full version. The only improvement for me is if the organisation of sub tasks could be made easier. Other than that, this is the best To Do app out there!",
I love this app. It syncs to all my devices and I can share tasks or make notes on them. The trouble I had was getting the app to work on Windows. It wouldn't open and still won't. I have to use the website on my PC. Works fine on all my other devices.,
"I've been working a GTD workflow for a year with this app and have found it useful and reliable. It isn't bloated with features, but the main things are solid: multi-platform, sync, versatile reminders. The home screen widget is a critical feature for me. I also appreciate that Doist values my data as much as their own: the nightly backups are well worth the premium subscription. Any Sync/DB issues seem to be resolved. The UI is clean and easy to use — the material design update really improved that.",
"I've been a long time customer and the app has improved significantly over the years I've been with Todoist. It's clean, fast and has all the features I need. I look at other apps but always come back to this one",
"This app is well designed and great for keeping track of things you need to do. The only improvement I would make is to add a way to create recurring tasks that repeat daily, weekly, etc. That would make it 5 star.",
"There is just so much missing in the basic free version that i don't think, its an app i'd invest in long term.  Some must have features of task management are only available if you pay for it. Reminders, labels, etc are options that mandatory for a to do list. Then there are bugs. New Sub tasks cannot be added to tasks to first tasks if there are other tasks in the web app. So I add tasks and sub tasks on web app... Then go to app on phone and then move the tasks. I don't think ill use this much longer.",
"Have a filter for sub tasks. You've been asked this for a very long time and have had to take down the feedback forum owing to the volume of complaints. We know the official line very well - sub tasks may get missed; let us, the customers decide if that's a risk worth trading for a nested and neet filter view. JUST GET IT DONE TODOIST!!!!",
I literally use and rely upon this app every day and overall it is very good. Recent months have brought increased stability and sync reliability among many bug fixes. I do wish they had not closed the support forum where users could interact and learn from and help each other--I quite miss that and my engagement with the app has tapered some. But I continue to use it as it is the best option out there for me and it's really quite good. Try it!,
"I had it at 5 stars, but after my free trial expired it wouldn't let me use comments anymore. That's fair, but it also blocks me from looking at my really important note comments I had written.   Edit: They replied and said that I can access them via the web so I've remade the 5 star rating!",
"Great interface, powerful features for organizing lists of to do's. Easy to use, syncs with their cloud service so it's accessible on all your devices. Lots of apps or add ons for various operating systems and programs. I like the quick entry of tasks with recognition of time/date. E.g. ""Buy milk after work tomorrow"" ends up on your tomorrow list. ""Put out recycling every other Monday"" ends up recurring every other from the Monday within the current week. Adjusting due date is simple if needed. Liking it!",
"The app is beautiful and is extremely user friendly, more so that the competition like wunderlust, gtasks, and others in that same category. However, even though this app is stunning, it's flawed. To unlock the most basic features you will have to pay $28.00 sub fee per year... Why would I do a sub when other apps can offer me the reminder function for free? Try again and maybe if you allow users for a one time payment it'll take off.",
"It helps me a lot in getting organised.  I have a terrible memory, so I just write any errands, books, shipping, anything really, that comes to my mind.  This way I never miss a detail. I recommend it for busy people who have to keep  lot of small errands in mind.",
"I think it could use more step-by-step instructions.  It is assuming that I know more than I do.  Maybe younger people with more tech savvy sail through this learning curve, but I am having trouble finding documentation on how to upload the program.",
"To me it's still the best to do list management app out there. Simple, clean and efficient. This coming from a geek with his finger on the pulse of tech and apps. Always looking if for the next best evolution. To me, not other app can compete on Todoists ability to quickly input a list of tasks. It's essential for be to insert quickly and have the task categorised and scheduled. Also, Doist should really write a book on how to properly sync data to the cloud. It's second go non.",
I have always had difficulty keeping track of everything I needed to do. I have tried other solutions before and it took too much effort that I stopped using it. This system is great and I have it loaded on all my devices. I recommend this to anyone looking for help remembering all the tasks of the day.,
Good app to get myself organised. Not sure if the karma points are necessary though. You can categorise your tasks and design your own categories too. Haven't tried the premium version or adding other people into my tasks.,
"All the features so far are very satisfying. I must bring to the light the fact that Todoist allows completed tasks to be displayed upon search  queries; something Wunderlist doesn't (and probably never will)! However I am hoping the Todoist customer support team to be much, much more active in responding. Feature request: Please allow indexing within the completed tasks and subtasks so that subtasks do not lose their index level upon completion. 5 stars rating awaits you. Thank you!",
"I chose this to do list because it can be very detailed, and I find that very useful. The only improvements I would think it needs is setting defaults for tasks, like what inbox it goes to, and who it's assigned to, it gets annoying having to choose all the settings every task I make. But this is still my favorite to do list!",
"Love the ability to sort your lists with priority and also with different labels which are available with the premium edition.  The repeating task functionality is great, although it helps having programming experience to use it.  Best To Do app I've used so far out of Trello, Any.do, To Do Reminder and Google Keep and is way better than paper or using a doc :)  Although I do still like to use Any.do for things I need pop up reminders for.  Also I like how much u can see at once with Google Keep.",
"Works as it should on all platforms. I have two missing features: 1) batch operations on many tasks is clunky because one needs to shift-click on every desired task - can't select a bunch at once; 2) I'd like easier access, review, and management of completed tasks. Otherwise, an excellent app.",
"I've reviewed a lot of to do list makers, but this one takes the cake. I can even use it as an add on to chrome which I love. The only thing I'd change is that uncompleted tasks become ""overdue"". But that's a personal preference :) great app",
"I have been using this app for a few years now and love how intuitive it is to use and how beautifully it can clearly present information in a small area. Some things I'd like to see are perhaps a workflow/pipeline mode where you can switch your tasks between the current ""classic"" view (I.e. listed top to bottom) to a left to right ""progress view"" where you can define progress stages in columns and drag your tasks to the appropriate stage you've taken them to (a bit like what you can do in trello).",
So fast the best task manager I came across. Simple and easy to use. The only thing that disappoints it it's a little too money oriented. The free plan is very limited compared to options and features offered by other similar apps.,
I have had so many to do apps and I never seem to be able to actually get anything done because I would never open the app up. But not anymore with this app is check it daily and actually can set goals for how many tasks I want to complete each day. Then I have the chance to reach different levels by consistently hitting my daily goal of completed tasks. So not only am I finally getting things done but I get to challenge myself at the same time. This app and my Erin Condren planner are LIFE SAVERS.,
"Hate the super sized fonts and not keen on the changes to the layout. The fact that new tasks have pretend text in them is really distracting. I use to like it's simplicity and functionality, this version is step backwards. Sad that the developers don't seem to care about users views.",
"The best to do app I had so far. It can be very simple for not high demanding users and also can be used by hard users like me (keyboard shortcuts, creating many sub-projects and sub-tasks).",
"Pros: Best to do productivity app I've found. Quick entry, easy to organize.  Recommend company's blog for information on organization and tips. Installed on mobile, desktop and chrome plug in. Syncs nicely between platforms. User interface is clean and intuitive, well designed. Cons: Few problems with reoccurring projects dissapearing after marking off. Sub-lists seperating into new projects/projects being duplicated after altering sublists (user error?). Doesn't play nice w/Zapier & IFTTT recipies.",
"The app is a good complement to the desktop extension for Chrome.  UI is simple and intuitive.  Most of what I want on a smartphone. It integrates perfectly with my laptop, the laptop UI enables to link emails to the tasks.  A good buy, as premium is recommended. Something missing is the ability to link a contact to a task, as currently this is limited to emails and websites",
"Was always hesitant to try a monthly subscription for a tasks app - got 6 months free thru a third party and so far am thinking might renew. Solid task manager, and integration with other apps is quite good (and seems to be getting better.) Sometimes maybe you do get what you pay for?",
Great app exactly what I wanted....I just wish it had alarms to remind me of the tasks I have set that have a time ...notifications become lost with all of them and do not continually remind you until you complete your task.,
"I just wish that some of the tabs that the premiums have were free. But I still love the app so far, today's my third day using it so I'm kind of pretty hyped-up about it. 😁👍💯",
"I've had a Todoist account for over a year now. I used it 3-4 times originally. I was recently beginning to get overwhelmed with law school and I was tired of adding simple tasks (reading for a particular class, a particular assignment, place to be, etc) to my full calendar since it was very time consuming. I relaunched Todoist and I am able to keep everything so organized and on track. It has been extremely helpful because it works across Android, iOS, and Windows. Thank you. I highly recommend it!",
"Love the shortcuts, labels, and prioritization tags. I've added my own time tags so I can easily see if I have more tasks than time on a day. It'd be nice to be able to hide tasks that are recurring or scheduled into the future when looking at a ""project"". The list gets long. Not a deal breaker for me. Great app and great web interface! Migrated from Simpleology which was very effective but ugly.",
"I am enjoying this app so far. Quick, simple and very clean processes without any extra raff and the perfect tool for getting things done it's improved my productivity by quite a bit :)",
"A ""to do"" list with no reminders? Free apps like Wunderlist, Google Keep, and Evernote are cross-platform and allow reminders and recurring tasks. Todoist looks beautiful, integrates with Outlook, Gmail, etc and the pro version looks really inviting. However I don't see enough separation to justify the relatively high price.",
"Having bounced between a few alternative to-do list applications, I've comfortably settled down with Todoist. No other app I've seen thus far has all the features I would consider mandatory: list sub-items, sync between devices, and an Android widget. I'd have happily paid for these features, and you're telling me they're so basic that they're FREE on Todoist? Dang, son. You crazy kids must be some kinda new-age philanthropists.",
"Use it everyday.  Very practical and so easy-to-use.  Very little learning curve.  Good reminders.  Lets you group tasks by project,  comment, and share.  The project organization works well because you can have subprojects.  Not a complicated project manager but more powerful than just a to-do list.  Only drawbacks are that you can't assign tasks and there are only two choices - completed and pending.  It would be useful to have ""in progress,"" ""canceled,"" etc.",
"Much faster. I can set recurring events really easily; I typed in ""mow my lawn every other Thursday starting tomorrow"" and it totally worked. However, I have one big suggestion that will make the difference between me using this app for everything and using this app in addition to others. I think time periods need to be integrated in. The app is fantastic now, but if I could type in ""work tomorrow, 1pm-10pm"" and then it goes up as a time period rather than a single task, this could replace my calendar.",
Fast and simple. That's enough of a reason to use it. No clutter and overload on features. Just add swipe add swipe. It's Great. Though I'd like it if there was an easier way to adjust the priority of tasks without having to enter the full edit window.,
"Been using prem vsn for years.  As a possessed list-maker, I love the seamless usage between tablet, laptop, smartphone, iPad.  Does everything.  But recent ""improvements"" are not so great - wierd colors on priorities, changing text into due dates, search function change.  Still, cant do without it.  Thank you!",
"This is by far the most user friendly to do app that I've used, and I've used plenty. My favorite thing is how easy it is to enter tasks and due dates. I can just type in 'due tomorrow' and it'll set it for that day, instead of going through the hassle of flipping through a calendar for each task. It saves so much time when entering a lot of tasks. I paid for premium, and I think it's worth it. I love being able to sort things by label and filter. There are so many combos of filters that you can create, it lets me customize my lists for my own needs. Your app is great. Keep making awesome things!",
Been a subscriber for a year to the premium. Really love the design. One problem I have is the inability to enter projects when a new task is created. I use projects heavily and if I create a task in the inbox I need to go back into the task and assign it to a project. Kinda annoying. Other than that it is good. Not sure I will renew subscription yet.,
"Nice and friendly, and I appreciate the little shots of dopamine this app encourages, it makes completing the mundane a little more interesting. As a result I'm way more organised. Oh and the karma levels make me feel like the Buddha, that's always good too.",
This is a great task manager that works nicely with other platforms and apps. I was searching for a task manager that works great with Evernote and Toggl so it streamlines my GTD process. It also integrates with Outlook and Gmail so I can quickly create tasks based on emails and attach them  without having to leave the email client! I took out 1 star because I had to buy the premium subscription to be able to use some of the features that I believe should be in the free version.,
"I understand that to do list keeps you organized, but you can get all the paid features in free apps. True it takes some digging around, but its not worth 1800 for a year. Uninstalling now",
Lack of elementar features. Bad designed. Hard to make any simple action. No date selector. Unavailable add subtasks. Unavailable see more than 7 days ahead.,
These jerksoff spam your email!!....edit: i did not op-in! What the heck type of attitude is that? Dont spam me man! Got it? You sent me multiple unsolicited junk mails to me within hours!! That is the definition of spam. So.. stop! I deleted your app. Me downloading was not an invitation to spam my mailbox. If i could give negative 500 rating i would for this terrible attitude. Thats like thinking its ok to steal a car because the owner didnt say you couldn't..  stop being spammers. Thank you.,
(Subscriber) super satisfied. The most functional way to manage tasks with plenty of ways to organize your tasks plus time based and location based reminders and psychological points system to keep you motivated.  Difficulty of Use: Medium,
"Need to spend a bit more time sorting out the notifications, great to be able to set location specific reminders in the paid version, but don't seem to actually remind me when I get there! Very useful in general and is proving a valuable part of my daily work flow. To be able to link Evernote notes on reminders would be great, could add the Evernote email address every time but a bit long winded process.",
"For what it does it's a pretty good app, but the reminder functionality (one reminder for all tasks daily) is next to useless for me. Give me per task reminders that can be customized or snoozed and I'll be thrilled!",
"Either the desktop/web version is too amazing or the app is not so great cause I really don't like using it. I wish it was more intuitive, everything is too many taps away and there's no drag & drop.",
"This app is BEYOND what I expected. I am sitting here in disbelief. I was doing homework, and it popped up. This the best app for keeping your life together!  Go ahead and download this NOW, I promise you, it will not upset you. The app is PERFECT FOR ME.This whole App is perfect from the name of the app, to the way it is set up to use, EVERYTHING! It is like an ideal to-do list that I would make if it were me. I will be thinking about purchasing the premium!!!! Thank you Todoist!",
Beautiful UI. The UX could be better... for e.g.. two clicks to enter a custom date/time for tasks. What is annoying is that some really basic features like finding completed tasks are either hidden somewhere I can't find it requires a premium upgrade.,
"Very easy to use app. Started using it at the recommendation of Tim Challies in his book Do More Better. However, I miss the feature from TeuxDeux that automatically rolls an uncompleted task over to the next day. I would love to see this option added.",
It actually took more effort to ignore my task than to do them. Fantastic tool. It's the only todo list app i now use,
Too many spaces to ad your to do list. I felt confused on which area to keep my lists. Could just be me. I hope others who currently use this app understand it and those who are just beginning to us this app have better luck then me.,
I just loved this app. Free 1 month premium trial. However paying 30$ per year just for an app is little expensive to me.                                    Had it offered premium for like earlier WhatsApp rate I would have straight away bought it for 5 years.,
Coming from someone with ADD this has changed my life in terms of time management and productivity further then any other app I have tried. Simple to use but keep digging and you will find tones of features to use.,
My favorite task management app. It's efficient and easy to use with alot of features that make it a prime chose for daily use.,
Best of all the apps that I've tried. Simple to use and segregate work/home/shopping so it's easy to keep on top of things without getting unnessary information. Highly recommend.,
"I can't survive without it. Not always intuitive, but once you've used it for a week it will be indispensable. They are always improving the interface and it is way better than 6 months ago.",
Couldn't ask for a more lightweight capture system. I mainly use Todoist quickly capture tasks and information throughout the day with ease and speed. It works wonderfully offline as well which is the biggest thing for me.,
"Natural language input for dates and labels,  all my devices,  seamless sync and powerful filters",
"It is great to be able to just type and add to do items, and then tick them off once completed, on any of my devices.",
"Although it is super simple, it's nice to be able to make a list of things to do effectively, and even with the reminders of overdue tasks, it pushes you to do them; which is great",
So I had a little bug and rated it 2 stars... within 24 hours I got an email from todoist on how to solve it step by step. I love the app and also it's awesome creators 😉👌,
"Great app, i really enjoy it, but, i do not like create new task interface. It is not convenient to slide up and down with changing text size in order to find reminders option or due date option. Therefore, i give 4",
Notifications could be better. Anydo has much better integration with Android. Plus I can't schedule nothing for repeat,
I've used a lot of todo list apps and have settled on Todoist for its simplicity. It has just the right blend of flexibility and function.,
I appreciate the easy to use interface and the satisfying swipe to complete tasks. Would like the ability to skin the widget to match my calendar.,
"I'm uninstalling this disgusting App, which don't have any good feature for free. Every basic features need you to upgrade the app, it's sucking too much battery as 🔋 consumption is 9-11%. And also this App expands to bloody 65.5 Mb & consuming 200mb of RAM …!!",
"Only thing I would add would be that when you select a Level 0 project, it shows you how many tasks you have in sub-levels / total number of tasks, WITHOUT having to use the labelling system, which just takes extra steps.",
"Still getting used to the scheduling keywords... but since they have an article explaining it, thats cool. I have used it all week and love mostly the ability to create repeating tasks, and to sort all of your tasks by day... or by project.",
The best for actually doing things. Karma system motivates you. Adding notes and being able to set as done activities in the past would be great.,
"I can finally see all my mental to-dos on one place, and when I see how overwhelming they are, I can easily spread things out over a week or month. I'm actually getting stuff done rather than being paralyzed by always having too much to do.",
"There are only a few premium features I have to have. The rest are all extras that clutter things up for me. Because of that, the price is uncomfortably high. Would love to see ala carte premium features.",
Has allowed me to track actions of multiple deliverables and keep track of progress. Helps keep me from letting things fall through the cracks.,
it does exactly what it should without making you walk the extra mile to do it... the notifications based on location are awesome,
I use it everyday. Nice for organizing multiple events. The free version of this is perfect. No need to buy the paid version unless you are extremely busy.,
This helps extend the infrastructure of Todoist to perhaps its most useful platform. Bug free so far and intuitive ux.,
Todoist has basically replaced my short-term memory. It can be used in so many different ways. Find a workflow that works for you and you'll never turn back.,
This is most likely the easiest app of this class to use. The interface is intuitive and the multiple platform support is awesome.,
"Exactly what I wanted. For a free organizer it really gives a lot. The karma feature is a nice motivation. I would like an option with a status icon that permanently shows the progress of the day, with this the reminders would be unnecessary.",
"I've used premium for a few years now. It is an excellent product. I am not a power user, but I understand all of it's features. It is available on many platforms. It is powerfully simple.",
"This is a fantastic, simple, clean task list app. I like that it syncs between the app and computer desktop, browser, etc. Nice intuitive features include recurring tasks, delaying a task until tomorrow or next week with the click of an icon, and many more. Great app!",
This app is among the best productivity apps I have used. Be sure to read the manual to figure all the neat little tricks.,
"Really amazing app. Increases personal productivity and never lets you 
forget about important things. I started off with the basic version and 
have recently upgraded to the premium one and I have to say it's been 
surprisingly good so far.",
I love this app but I really wish we could change the spacing between tasks. There is way too much and it doesn't feel minimal when it could be.,
"I've tried several time management systems and tools, but none seemed to work for me, until I found this one. I love that I can access my task list from all the devices I use, whereever I go, that I can group tasks by project, and assign priority levels.",
"Does exactly what it says. The free tier is a little nerfed IMHO, but the IFTTT integration makes this a no-brainer.",
"Multiple platform use is seamless, layout is so easy to use. Entering an item to do in advance is difficult. So if I want to get item for Wed and item for Tues done on Mon my list  items are auto corrected away.",
It's great on all my devices and my computer. It also works for me better than the Apple To Do List,
I really need a to do list manager because I'm involved in multiple activities that are time intensive. This app handles them all with ease. Well worth the price.,
"When I first installed this app last year, it was bothersome. They have found the balance with reminders.",
"So useful, and intuitive. I constantly use it, all day. The widget is one of the best I've ever seen. It's pretty unfortunate that the paid version is monthly though. One solid payment would be more attractive, I think.",
"The interface is simple, so it works just fine. I like using it but tempted to look elsewhere because the upgrade to a 30€ per year is just exaggerated! Upgrade for what anyway? HOW CAN I STOP app from sending emails to my account?",
I like this app. I still have to figure some things out but either way it's a good app.,
"The website is good - lots of functionality. Unfortunately the app is awful. Most of the useful features are missing. I have no clue which functions work or don't. I just tried to drag a task to be a subtask of another in the app - somehow it ended up deleting the other 5 subtasks instead. This is the last thing you need - there's certainly no way to retrieve them on the app, fingers crossed I can find them on the website. Other obvious missing features are a way to sort tasks (again I had to sort on web)",
"Cannot view tasks that were checked off... I accidentally checked some off and couldn't add them back, or reflect on the day and what was accomplished. Won't use this app mainly because of that.  I was using the free version",
"The application really is helpful simple to use and helps alot, wish there was less menus like today this week and stuff like that just cause with the projects folders it starts to look messy and over complicates things but other than that really worth it.",
"Great app. It was easy to get started and has plenty of features for power users. Support were nice, quick and helpful.",
Everything awesome. Moto e. My phone never been so useful before. Even with virtual assistants.,
The best to do app out there. keeps you going with some innovative features.  Premium gives you a lot more features for a very reasonable price.,
I used omnifocus on my mac for a long time but had a Nexus 6p. I realized that I needed something that was multiplatform. So todoist was perfect for that. It's simpler than omnifocus but has all the power. Great app 10/10 would r8 again.,
"There are things that I love about this app, like the karma bit. However, the subtasks are not as easy to follow on the app as the desktop or Web version. I wish it were easier to see the hierarchy on the app.",
The projects feature lets me be even more organized but dividing my tasks how I want. I struggled to find this option in other similar apps.,
"I've tried a bunch of todo apps before,  but none stuck. Thanks to the amazing widget,  I'm still using this one weeks later.",
Even the free version has no annoying nags or adverts.  Very good.  Thanks.,
This has really helped manage tasks between my manager and me. The only thing I'd like to see is more automation to set tasks based on email content.,
"Very intuitive and easy to understand interface, and syncs well across all devices. A can't live without app.",
It needs an option for deadlines and add things to do in events in Google Calendar. Give alerts too.,
I am still a new user; but i like that it reminds you you with an email with a daily listing of uncompleted tasks. Will download onto my tablet and hope the cell and tablet sync.,
"While it has a few quirks, I find the free version pretty good. I just moved all my tasks out of WorkFlowy and left info and far future projects there. I like the 7 day view.",
"I honestly couldn't function without this thing, I remember so much more and achieve so much more thanks to todoist!",
Best task list app. Just a suggestion. Maybe make different priorities or projects more obvious such as changing the colour of the whole task instead of just a small dot or the thin colour bar on the side.,
Helps me schedule future items I need to complete. I like earning karma points. I wish it Would let me categorize different areas of my life.,
"After trying Trello and Any.do (and a couple of ""lesser"" apps), and trying them seriously, for months, with dozens of tasks I find Todoist the best one for high volume, fast processing of tasks in demanding environments where prioritisation is unpredictable and highly changeable.",
"Overall good, but when clicking on the back button of my phone the app closes. It is really annoying. Please fix!",
"All the different views, lists, by date, projects, etc. No wonder I could not stay organized before. This app keeps this unorganized person very organized and on schedule!",
I have been waiting a long time for a to-do list program like this. It is really well thought out and works seamlessly between platforms. Well done!,
"If only better RTL languages support  (like Hebrew), would have given a 5 star ranking",
It's really helping me track my days. I am much more organized than i was before this . I am getting a lot done.,
"Some apps better than this. According to your reply, you want to know the features... Firstly, while scheduling, I need to touch screen 7-8 times. Second It's showing that you are done for today but what's next? For that i need to go for next 7 days by 3 touches!",
"Excellent, intuitive and effective. I love this app. Simply amazing for organizing. Especially bc you can upload documents and tag emails",
"The premium is definitely worth it. If you're into GTD, this is a great app that syncs seamlessly between platforms, is useful, and very intuitive.",
Prefect. Just bring your price down ALOT for the premium service,
"Excellent ecosystem of apps. They have the simplest UI, and do exactly what you want them to do. The natural language processing involved is sophisticated and smart. Excellent app - I kinda feel handicapped without it.",
Best todo app. I use the Web version for work and the Android app at home. The karma points makes it even more interesting to use.. :),
"All the features you could ever need - at a price. I use this app all the time as a student, it would be great if you could offer an educational discount.",
"I like it, but the free version is lacking some of the most basic components...like Google calendar synchronization. A notification reminder that I have to pay for? Puh-leeze!  The premium version is almost $30 PER YEAR???  Nah...definitely not worth it. Just to get some color options and a notification? Nope. If anything, should be a flat cost to upgrade. Better options out there.",
I think subscritption for a year is pricey. Id prefer to try it for a shorter period.,
Works well.  Had some difficulty getting it to do what I wanted it to do at first but then I figured out how to use filters.  Also had to ask support for help with something and they got right back to me.,
"The project feature helps to organize your personal tasks. Also I love the priority feature, it reminds you the most important things to do first.",
"Just starting using it and I love that it's cross platform. From my desktop to my tablet and phone, all synced up. Awesome.",
Started using for not only simple tasks to do but family projects and reminders as well. Handy lists synchronised on all our devices. Thanks.,
Couldn't go from day to day without this app to organise my life. Just needs an easier way to move todos into projects while creating them and it's perfect.,
you can make a task but cannot set up reminder for this task unless I upgrade to pro which makes it useless.,
I have been using it for over a year now.  I am so grateful o he team for the awesome work. Todoist is helping me reaching my goals everyday. I love it.,
Has easily categorised groups and shortcuts. You can have things on repeat in unique patterns and it totally gets it!,
After some time of usage I would say that balance of free/paid features is a bit unfair and I missing reminders in free version.,
Overall a good app to help u organize and remind important tasks. However couldn't find a feature to set recurring tasks which is needed sometimes.,
Just an app to keep myself organized. The aesthetics aren't bad but nothing about this app makes me want to shout it from the rooftops.,
Just works and its free. If you want more advanced features you have to pay....but the free version is plenty capable.,
"Easy to use while keeping several projects going at the same time, from groceries lists to work projects to errands. Quick to note  something when you think of it and reordered it at a later time.",
"It allows you to personalize the way you want to, has a great widget and the notifications doesn't interrupt whatever you're doing.",
Great app to keep everything organized. I love that it integrates into Microsoft outlook in windows and works across all platforms. Also easy to share lists with others using the app so you can have a family shopping list for example. I wish some of the premium features were available for free but the developers gotta eat I guess.,
The app is good but it's a little inconvenient. I have to add the task on today's date and then manually change it in details.,
Wish the reminder (alarm) feature is available in the free mode. Other calendar apps have similar memo + reminder features.,
"Lack some features like start date, task/project description, but works well enough.",
App is useful for keeping track of tasks. But daily emails are a bit nagging. Not sure I've familiarised myself with all the features yet so may be a better app than I think.,
"Can't repeat routine tasks automatically without paying, but this gets the jobs done.  Can set up to 4 priorities.",
Nice and decently versatile interface. I really like the multi-level task tracking and the different notification systems. I would suggest allowing for military time when putting in due dates and reminders though.,
"I should give this 5 stars, but selfishly, I'm still waiting for the Evernote integration that was in dev a while back. Still...ALMOST perfect!",
Great simple lists and can be scaled up for larger projects using gtd methodologies. Been using this for over 2 years now and can't go back.,
It's great and I love how it syncs between my phone and my laptop. The encouraging notes when I tick off tasks are my favorite feature!,
Love that it is pretty much cross platform making my to-do list accessible everywhere.,
I'd pay for pro but feel the price is a bit steep. I'd much prefer a monthly payment option,
The free version doesn't even have basic features such as setting reminders.,
"This is the first to do list that has actually assisted in my productivity. I never thought I would give up my paper lists, but I think ToDoist has done it for me.   It would be awesome to see some different views available, like a tile view of the projects to quickly see a few at the same time. Also, a quick notes area could be nice.",
Great to-do app but some features like notes and tags that feel fundamental require sub.,
"Need to move items from one list to another. However, I haven't figured out how to do that yet. If it were more intuitive, assuming it can be done, I would give the program a 5 star rating.",
"Finding it very helpful in keeping me organized and having it on my Windows desktop, Android phone and my Chromebook makes it perfect!",
"Perfect for the procrastinator type.. Add a due date, or not, how you handle your to dos is your business! Lots of options in the free version. Definitely gonna buy the full version soon!",
"I wasnt able to keep up with anything. Ive tried sticky notes, notepads, calanders. Nothings works as good as this app!",
If you are like me that need a little nudge to get things done then this is for you. Also it work as a place where I stores my quick thoughts and ideas that I could work on later.,
"Amazingly design, but basic features intentionally crippled in favor of the premium app.  Reminders are an incredibly important feature to any app, especially one where notifications are hit or miss.  I have yet to get a notification when any task was coming due.",
"I've been using this app for over an year. This is one of those apps that has become an habit of mine. This is revolutionary. Not the idea, the implementation",
"This app helps me remember, order and check off what I've done. Recurring tasks are really helpful too",
It the best app to remind and keep things on track. Very very strongly recommending for reminding day to day task with option to share it with other concern people related to it.,
This app is really great and helps me coordinate with my boyfriends better. Easy 5 stars. Would recommend to anyone,
"After trying dozens of todo apps, Todoist ended up as the absolute winner for me. It has all the features that is needed for managing tasks, works on every platform with a slick UI and comes with a very reasonable price tag.",
No qualms about the app so far except for the steep price for premium. I definitely would buy the premium version if it wasn't  $20/year,
The app seem simple but I have had hard time and still couldn't find a way to delete a project. This should be easy,
"Just helps me get stuff done, because I love checking things off",
"Why can't we carry out tasks in batch. Change priority levels in batch, assign to projects in batch? These should be what you should focus on first",
"Love that it gives me feed back, I can make list with sub lists, color code and label. It gives me reminders each day..great app",
"I like how I can track my tasks at the level I want and can spread  them throughout the week and tap-n-drag to reorganize them. I also like having overdue tasks still be visible, and the options for reminders.",
"Looked like a great app. However, I thought the whole idea was to have reminders so you didn't forget important tasks.  For that you have to pay $29 per year.  Uninstalling.",
"Room for improvement in ui ux. Looking for completed tasks by date. Uniformity across platforms, I use it on Android, Windows, iOS.",
"I like to use lists, they take worry away. Put something on a list, act on it when you need to or are ready. Organising with projects, filters and labels is great.",
"I just got the premium version and loved it instantly. Notification system and reminders are exactly what I needed, plus labels that add additional level of organization.",
"I'm a scatter-brain, but I try to use this here and there.  That's a lot from someone who prefers pen and paper",
Really enjoy and function is great.. just not sure paying for further functions is worth it.,
Use this a lot for simple shopping lists to more complicated projects. Powerful filtering and labeling plus task sharing make it good value for the premium subscription.,
"Fairly easy to use.   I gave up trying to get Google Tasks to work,  even with GTasks.",
"Easy to use, no ads, quick to understand,and it never breaks down.",
"I honestly use it very simply. But for having my todos subbed everywhere and in a clean, non-distracting format, it works quite well.",
"I've tried most of the major to do lists and this is my favourite, so much so I've gone premium. It's beautifully designed and very powerful.",
"I wish there were a way to set how long you will work on a project, so it shows up well in advance of the due date when needed.",
Clean and easy to use interface. Convenient. Would be better if integrate with calendar function to assign existing tasks to specific date & time or in daily agenda view.,
"For the person who wants a simple daily to do list, give a check box that shuts off sorting by days and just leaves a long to do list with no date ordering but still sortable.",
It does exactly what I expected and then some. I love that I can use a chrome plug-in on any computer to edit my list.,
"Overall good but i would like to have a event calender function as well. Therefore, i no need to switch from one app to another app.",
"Used to use this daily, trying to watch security and the app doesn't allow you to use it unless you give it access to your google acct OR sign up with them. No way for local use only, there got to be a shady reason for that. Left for a open source version",
When i read it say that i can share my to do list with another person after i done it say i have to pay for it to get those features...,
"As robust as it gets. I do wish that the process of creating reminders was a little quicker, but this is quite a small nit.",
"I use todoist all day long and it never feels like it gets in the way. Quick, intuitive and friendly even in the free version.",
This app is just a joy to use. It's the only todo list app that I've actually consistently used for weeks. Has everything you need and works like a dream.,
"I usually forget or procrastinate many things but with the help of todoist, life's been much easier.",
I have used it for a couple of weeks now and it faithfully reminds me of my promises to myself.  Love  it,
Great app for organizing your everything in your life! The only thing I would change/add is a calendar overview (e.g. weekly or monthly),
I love the fact that you can share lists!! Highly recommended for anyone who wants to get better organized.,
"Helps me keep on top of my day-to-day life stuff, and plan things for the future.  Only which the back button would take me to the inbox and not exit the app.",
"As a very forgetful person this app is a godsend, really easy to use and very helpful with keeping me organised.",
I have tried them all. This works best for me. Available on multiple operating systems ans devices. Easy drag and drop tasks and projects. Premium user. Works across multiple platforms.,
Just right if you're semi-anal and just need to jot down some overall tasks to work through. Big picture thinkers unite.,
"Seems pretty silly. A beautiful app, but I'm not diving all in with a $30 payment so that I can view my completed tasks.",
"I love that I can sync between ios, Android and desktop. Wish I could get some of the features without recurring fees like labels. How about a one time upgrade for a few handy things?",
"I like it that it keeps prompting you if you do not complete tasks. However, putting in future tasks is tricky.",
"Love this app, finally found an app that can manage ALL my projects in the one app across all my devices and platforms. Really useful to be able to add other people to specific projects. If it was able to sync with Google calendar it would be 5/5",
This to do list gives mange just what I need and presents it in a minimalist way that never gets in the way of just doing it. I especially like the location based reminders and the flexibility and natural language of the recurring reminders.,
"Loving the ease of use, the alarms/reminders on my phone and computer. I've even suggested it to a few coworkers who are loving it as well :)",
This app helps me wake up in the morning get stuff done this is an app I'm recommending,
"Moreso than with other to do apps, I feel like this one hides a lot of features behind a subscription. Which I understand, but am not fond of. I really only keep using it because IFTTT integrates better with Todoist and Trello than other options I have available.",
This app helped me to remember small details. Very useful app.,
Todoist is the best task manager out there.   I have tried many of the apps offered and finally found a keeper.  Thanks for helping me keep my life organized.,
"This app helps me, I use to text myself everything in order to keep track of my day to day tasks, or I'd have post-it notes everywhere, with this app I don't waste paper and I can check tasks off as I go along.",
I'm finding myself using this more often as time goes by.   Soon to be indispensable...,
Like the app but the widget is way to big considering it only allows me to see three tasks at a go. Reducing the fontsize (or enabling an op to on to do this) would allow it to become actually useful.,
"I used to use wunderlist, but like this better.  The outlook integration is awesome.",
"I'm type A but I'm also ADD so this is perfect for me. It's quick, easy to use and it builds in to my life.  I'd love for there to be more flexibility on tasks that are dependent on each other but do not repeat.  Would love to incorporate more daily project management with daily To-Do aspects and IFTTT variables.",
Keeps all of your stuff straight in a fast and easy platform. Also has a fun edge to it with your KARMA SCORE making it have a game or competition element to it.,
"The free version works well enough, but it gets annoying to have to re-enter things multiple times.",
"Easy to use.  I like the fact that I can start to type ""Saturday"" and it enters the task on Saturday for me.",
Doesnt deliver in the follow through factor.  There are better more comprehensive apps out there.  I don't recommend this app for task management,
I have the premium version and the reminders feature makes me considerably more productive. This is a fantastic app for managing business and personal to-do lists.,
"One of my biggest aggrevations for years has been to simply use Outlook tasks from my desktop and sync it to my mobile devices without clunky third party apps. This is slick, automatic, thought free, with a great interface. My tasks appear on todoist exactly as they appear in Outlook on my desktop and then todoist adds additional management tools. It's really great.",
Congratulations to the developers of this program for a great interface that truly helps you stay on top of your tasks. I have increased my productivity with Todoist. Keep it up!,
I am using this app for 6 months on my pc laptop and one plus and I would say its a great app beautiful ui and nice feature.  I thinking about buying pro.,
"Great product, the best personal to-do list that I've found. I tried several others. Has all the features I need to organize my work projects and personal errands, easy to track. I paid for premium and highly recommend it.",
"Todoist blog & support helps to learn other features and gives useful tips. The label , filter, , assign task, add a task features are easy to use with many extra functions. I can click on  the app from my tool bar & a drop down box allows me to add , edit a task or whatever I need to do . Finally just what I was looking for , thank you ToDoIst. Team",
Fantastic integration and extensions. I wish the interface was cleaner like anydo.... but I use this with sunrise calendar and it is everything in one place. Love the labels for the tasks.,
Have been using it for a week.  So far so good.  5th star reserved for after I go premium.,
Absolutely loving it and it is so easy to organize tasks in it. Not to mention the actual phone reminders too. Keeps my life quite clutter free and now I know how my weeks look like.,
"The premium version is ridiculously priced! If I could afford that, then someone else would be running my to do list.",
"Handy for everyone up to the busy professional. However an option or button to designate something as your ""next task"" without changing anything else such as priority or due date would be really handy.",
Simply and great for work that have a lot of tasks like daily operation. This app can set priority in 3 levels and create sub tasks so it really done best in their job to help us get work done.,
Many options r included in the paid version & blocked on the free version that made it a little bit annoying,
"Awesome app, easy to use and teaches you via the Karma tracker how you are performing with time management.",
"While tools are only as good as the person using them, if you use this app with purpose it will definitely make you more productive.",
"This app is great for personal and professional productivity. The best feature is probably the ability to email tasks to the application. Also, the experience is very fluid across all devices and platforms. The natural language processing used for scheduling tasks is pretty slick too. I've upgraded to premium.",
"Great interface, looks beautiful, constant updates, syncs across all my devices. This is the best to-do list app out there!",
My favorite organization tool. I couldn't find an app I liked since Astrid was sold. This keeps me in line! It's worth the upgrade.,
"I've used Todoist on my iPad, on my desktop computer, and my new Nexus 6P. It works flawlessly everywhere. It's simple and never fails. And the design is wonderful. Good work, Todoist team.",
This app has been super helpful for me.  It's easy to use and it enables me to organize everything I have to do.,
"The best thing, you're able to access your list from any device.",
I love this app and all the versions it syncs with like the Web version. Keeps me very well organized and on track.,
I am more productive than ever before. Simple to use. Gives an elegant view of your whole week. I can plan my week better now,
Very good I just want a list I can refer to whenever. Don't really need reminders every day. I know what is on it and I erase as I go along.,
"Amazing to keep organized, especially as a college student. I used to add tests/quizzes/homework on Google Calendar but this app allows for a quicker way to add tasks and have it sync to another app, Sunrise Calendar.",
This is an awesome app to help you stay on top of tasks. No fuss or clutter just clean and efficient.,
"This is the first to do app that I find myself consistently using. It's probably due to its simplicity, availability on all devices, and  reminders.",
I have used this about a week now and love it. It was definitely worth it to upgrade to the premium version.,
I've used a lot of the task management apps on Android and this is my favorite.  It's easy to use and portable. Sublists are a not easily implemented on mobile though.,
"I am happy to use this app, really help and motivate me to do my tasks",
"I just started using the free version and it seems fine. It's very basic without the premium features, and the price is right on the edge of resistance.",
"Everything you need and nothing you don't...perfect app for organizing thoughts, ideas, projects and tasks across multiple facets of business and personal life!",
App is crashing when I drag an item to another date. It is always behaving like that.. please have a look.. design wise it is good and clean..,
This app is easy to use. Great for having a backlog of projects to do and then setting due dates,
"Use it almost every day. Have the plugin in my browser at work, so I can update it anywhere.",
"A really useful electronic to do list. Simple, functional and grows with you to help track all your needs.",
I use it every day and it just keeps getting better and better!,
"Works well across platforms, easy to use projects and filters, best to do list app I've tried.",
I've found.   Use the widget and your task list is always quickly available. Register and you can also access from your PC. Functional without the pay-to-use features.,
"Name is missing the L, and notifications on email are unnecesary but avoidable.",
"I'm always looking for the ""perfect"" task manager and I think I have found it with Todoist. It's easy to fill out and works on multiple platforms at no additional cost. I love that I can set projects,  tasks, and subtasks, and color code them! Also, it doesn't break the bank.",
"I've used a lot of organization systems, physical and digital, but I always kept wishing that the system had one (or more) of the features of another system. Todoist has brought all those features and some cool extras together in one simple, elegant, product.",
I was looking for a simple application to store my TODO and alert me when not done on time. This perfectly works for me and meets my requirement,
"App was easy to learn and easy to use.  Already improving my productivity across multiple platforms (PC desktop, iPad, Android tablet and Android phone).",
"does everthing I need it to do, would be a little nicer if it were easier to make recurring tasks on a different date, but it basically handles everyrhing",
"Honestly this is just another todo app. But wait, a todo app needs to be enjoyable to use too! And here's where this excel. The",
Keeps me organized and send me little reminders each day. Way better. Than a little notebook- I always have my phone and I can always use my to do list.,
"Its a good app, lots of integration possible. Great reminders, post documents, comments, share features make it a great coordinator if working on team tasks. Also great if you just have a lot of tasks that need organizing/prioritizing/reminders",
does its job but it only does really bare minimum things that other apps do without asking to pay. I like the minimalistic design but thats about it.,
"No fonts to change. Can't set it to show a particular screen on launch, on phone or desktop. Sometimes obtuse and cumbersome to complete adding an item to a list. Long gone app called ""Catch"" i still use blows this out of the water for UI.",
"Waited for wunderlist to deliver on the Outlook Integration which ended in dismay, where this app has had it going on for years!",
Easy way to stay organized. Simple to do list interface with easy integration with calendars and Google chrome. Best to do list app I have used!,
"The Zen of Productivity Maintenance:  I use Todoist daily, and it has really increased my productivity and organization. I prefer using the mobile app over the web version, which is a real ""mobile first"" compliment to the Todoist developers. Loved it!",
I loved this app...helped me organize my daily activities  a lot...cant imagine my day without the organization of todoist now,
The free version is pretty good. I wish the paid version wasn't 28 a year.,
"My Todo-App of choice, owning the premium version. Love the clean design and the ""due date recognition"". Due to its offered APIs the app also integrates well with automation services like zappier and ifttt. 5/5 Stars :)",
"Before todoist I was an un organized slob. Now with the help of todoist , I don't forget to take showers, feed my dogs or any other tasks I may forget. It's amazing!",
"Cannot imagine a better project and task management tool. It is simple, clear, and intuitive. Highly recommended!",
I am on top of all of my classes because of this! My only Critique would be have a separate tab for papers. Other than that great app!,
"I would give it 5 stars if reminders were free, and/or if the premium version was more afforable.",
Only for extremely busy people- love that it syncs with Outlook and my phone. You won't miss another thing - and I've tried them all!,
Been using it a long time and it works great with good granular controls if you want them.,
"I find it easy to use, well laid-out and free of fluffy over-design. Works well on my Samsung Note. Recommended.",
"I love being able to list my daily activities then check them off as I go. If I overlook a task, move it to another day or week. This app saves me time.",
Use it after reading Do More Better by Tim Challies!  Quick read worth the 4.99 on amazon kindle.,
"Not stellar for in depth notes, but fantastic for tracking tasks and creating a task directly from gmail.",
With the reminders and shopping list my organization has never been better. Feeling like a super mom. 😁,
"I highly recommend this to-do lists app, I've tried almost every single one available in Google Play and this is the best one!",
I have tried lots of task apps and this is the best. If you have a small team to manage or just want to organise you home life this will help. Adding a task duration field would be the icing on the cake!,
"Decent to do list app, and having a desktop version is nice for cross platform task management. But not being able to see completed tasks is pretty annoying. So I'm switching!",
Holding out for the premium version.  Loving the free version.,
"Can use it across multiple platforms easily, but Outlook app sometimes struggles to sync",
Helps keep the average person stay on track & organized. Keeps Motivated to be more organized & Goal oriented through Success! Thanx,
"the app is the best i have used so far but it lacks the ability to copy and paste tasks and subprojects, I'd by premium just for that feature",
Bye bye... Useless app for non premium users!,
"Love the simplicity, yet powerful features. Enjoying getting organized. Would like more reporting.",
"I think ToDoIst devs. must see the app ""Click me - Reminder in a click"" in order to take ideas an do an easy and fast mode to create a note/task, thanks, God bless u, bye.",
"This app is pretty straightforward. It's like a to-do list you'd write, but you can access it from your phone and not lose it in a stack of papers. I love it. Without this app I forget everything",
"Perfect, simple. Does everything I need and is very easy to learn and use. Couldn't ask for anything more.",
My only complaint is the auto date feature. A lot of times I want to put a date reference in the task description but that date is not the due date. The Todoist program recognizes a date and  puts the task  on that date and this has messed me up a few times,
This is a great app provides you pay for the upgrade  and dont use the free version.,
Not very useful if you use OneNote for tasks and notes.,
It does a good job at keeping task and reminders. Also love the email notifications. It gives the task a sense of urgency.,
This app is the god of all to do and tasks app if you are paying and becoming the premium member. Excellent!,
"Used it for over a year. Apart from a couple of features, it is everything i want in a task list manager.",
"Easy to use, versatile, and sufficiently detailed.  Could use better sync with other calendars.",
Helps me accomplish things on a daily basis and is a good reminder. Very intuitive,
"Easy to use, helpful yet not annoying.",
This app is easy to use. The reminders are great. No issues or concerns.,
"This app is the things dreams are made of! Easy to use, versatile, multi-platform.  Serious winner.",
"Serves its purpose perfectly well, woth reminders and all.",
"I'm a big list fan, and I've tried out several applications before this one, and this one is by far my favorite.",
"Most complete, best functioning task app I have found, and I have tried a lot of them",
All the basic stuff is there. It works. I don't know how the paid process is.,
Have been using Todoist for a few months now. One of the best and easiest task manager to use. Especially like the cross platform functionality. Keep up the good work!,
Very simple way to organize things to do. It doesn't make you waste your time with unnecessary functions. I'll probably be using this daily!,
"Free version is very basic, more features only in premium, no trial etc. Also, don't support Android &lt; 4. But sync, tools for each platform and sharing is very good!",
Still learning how to organize the task lists.Would like to be able to move tasks from one list to another.,
Todoist is an AWESOME to do list/organization app which has vastly helped me achieve more and become more organized in my day to day life and professional endevors. I highly recommend!,
"One of really helpful apps I have on my phone, always reminds me about planned tasks ..",
"Multi-platform, easy to use, highly customisable. It's one of my most used apps day-to-day. paid for version will worth having",
I use this every day and it is a great complaint to the desktop app,
"Quick add button can't deal with multi language support and notification settings (Hebrew-English) . Pervious UI with a separate line for notification settings worked, now it is hidden in some sub menu.",
My team and I just wrapped up a year long web redesign project and stumbled onto Todoist as we were going along. Productivity shot up tremendously with Todoist. Thank you for such an awesome tool.,
Cannot see completed tasks by Label. By Project I can only see them with the Time shown: not the Date!,
"Excelente herramienta para organizar, planear y llevar un tracking de tus tareas! Excelente compatibilidad con Google Calendar, Evernote, IFFT, no le he encontrado ""pero"" alguno...",
This app would be even better if the cost was a little lower,
Easy to use and minimal distractions. Just what I need!,
"Great app, like that there is a chrome extension as well. Has made me so much more productive",
This app has really helped me to get organized and better yet prioritize and complete my workload. Still learning about it but loving it thus far,
"Have tried a number of todo apps but keep coming back to Todoist, it has all the features that I need and is clear and concise enabling me to concentrate on the work rather than managing the application.",
"I'll give you 5 star,  just give us task reminder in the free version.",
Only manages to-dos. I need to be able to see what's on my calendar in order to be able to schedule my tasks for the day. Useless with no actual time-blocking capability. Uninstalled.,
Fits perfectly with the getting things done methodology. Loved it from day one.,
Need a new update. If you can make it give a more effective reward system .,
This app is very useful. Help me a lot in organize daily tasks.,
Use it daily for all my productivity needs. Some aspects of the interface could be tweaked to make the operation smoother IMO e.g. a dedicated button to remove date and time,
Started using this app recently and so far have found it really useful ans very easy to use.,
Has got nothing for free users.  Waste of space.,
"Love it, covers 90% of what you'll need from a TODO list in the free version, the premium only adds stuff for hardcore TODO'ers :)",
"Trying this out for the first time... So far does what time it to do. Could make it easier to snooze a task as the reminder comes up, like, maybe a more could snooze action on the reminder pop up?",
"It's just a nice, simple and useful app that helps me to get stuff done and somehow it's motivating me to be productive!",
This is a great productivity app and I use it daily to list my tasks to do. The app regularity comes up with updates and also if I have any questions then I get response fairly quickly from support,
"The amount of integration with browsers, apps and the operating systems supported make this great for anyone managing tasks across multiple platforms",
Hands down best to do list app on play store..After trying all the apps in this category finally I have found the real to do list App...Best UI/UX...Thank you Todoist team for this wonderful app..,
It is because of apps like this that I am reminded that good design and respect for Android users isn't just a fantasy.  Basically puts the competition to shame.,
This app single handed got my life prioritized,
Daily I add tasks and when it's complete delete the task. It's simple and easy I love it,
"I mostly use this for IFTTT functionality, which is sound.",
A little hard to figure out at first but works great and easy the check off completed items!,
"Keeps me on task all the time, undoubtedly the best application for time management.",
"Totally awesome! Use it on desktop (pc and mac), outlook, and android. Syncs beautifully with premium, and I am beyond bappy with it.",
I do not have premium and it so sad for me. Anyway better apps I ever use to schedule,
"Bought a premium account yesterday, but cant log in via Chrome or IE . Please advise, as I cant submit a support request without logging in...",
Works a charm and flawless. Very good UX on Android and seamless integration with my Mac and iPad.,
Easy to use and contains all the features I need (and more) for my todo needs.,
Tried all the other similar apps but got back to Todoist.  Definitely a tool that'll help you be more productive. Totally recommend! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,
This is very helpful with my schedule bu t there is on thing I don't like about it is the premium upgrade you have to pay for but the rest I love it you should make the upgrade free,
Granted I do not us all the features but I have tried several similar apps and this one is the best!,
This application is really helpful to help you organize your work or your personal tasks. I have try several tools to manage todos but this is the only one that really work for me as it is simple and efficient ! Great app ! Please continue the good work!,
Is a great to do list.  I have been more productive since installing todoist.,
This is the easiest and most streamlined GTD app I've used. I love it.,
"Has a ton of features, yet is simple enough not to get in the way of your productivity.",
Even the free version has organized me. The premium one should be more helpful.,
Too few features in the Basic version for it to be worth it. Love the overall app though and I'm sure that Premium is great,
I have searched high and low for a To Do app I can live with and this one is it! Easy to use and as powerful as you need it to be at any level. Great!,
"I just want easy recurring tasks. Please.,",
"Great App. Excellent interface work sync to the website and desktop apps. World great, no problems.",
Has kept me motivated to get things done.,
"If you need to help organize you day, then this is the app for you.",
"In my opinion this thing is absolute junk.  What it does actually? Without alarm / reminder what values a to-do list ?  OMG super priced, this much for a todo service? ??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Date and time picker is the horrible(est) I seen on my life. You need to know exact keywords and formula to add task on a specific time. And that much price for this SHI*..... JUNK.",
"Didn't want anything too frilly and this delivered. Everything you need, nothing you don't.",
Always been a great app but the widget does not work on my new Note 4.  It worked fine on the Note 3.Any idea why? It won't update anything.  As of Feb 2015 the widget still does not update. Any ideas?,
"Without it I'm almost useless! It keeps my life organized and at the same time, flexible (unlike a regular calendar). I hope they bring soon boards to other platforms!",
"Constantly improving, simple yet feature-packed UI, and support for all your devices. Pro membership is well worth it, even if just to support these amazing devs!",
"Easy to use, features are exactly what I need to manage my todo list",
It's a great tool for me. Helps with staying on tasks as well as reminder what needs to be completed,
"Works really good. Fast, and clear. I miss a good overview of completed tasks.",
No way I'm not going to pay almost $30 a year to use an app! The free version is was too limiting you can't even set up reminders!,
I use this app daily and it's one of the most valuable and reliable app on my phone.,
Can't wait to see what else they do to make this an even more robust organizational tool,
I love the app buy it just really annoys me how it's not on the Samsung gear store if you could do this I would be so happy,
No the most intuitive and not much for free but ok,
"Finally a to do list that is cross platforms, I can share with others and collaborate on! Helps huge with all my work!",
"This app managed to replace 3 other apps. It does it All. It has a good balance of ease of use (novice) as well as more styles of usage (and those with more needs are serviced here, as well). Well Done !",
"Only if the most simple and easy to use to-do apps I have, and i use this one the most",
A little confusing on how to pick the date you want to make a list for,
Well thought about developing this app...good work..would like to buy the  premium version...But too costly to afford,
Sometimes what you need is not love but simplicity,
"Now I am a head I schedule for all my project, great reminder and flexibility",
"Keeps calling me a novice,  and generally labeling me,  which is in turn a judgement,  so one point off for judgemental programming,  but otherwise pretty awesome! Reminders by email to keep me reminded!",
"For enhancement, on the pick up date please make it more easy to pick up the time.",
"29 dollars PER YEAR to be allowed to do anything beyond what Google Calendar already does for free, with an interface I like better? I don't think so.",
"Excellent for planning and remind everything, it is too Easy to use, and funtional. It's my favorite one!",
"After only three days, I am in love with Todoist. Unique balance between simplicity and power.",
This made lot of things simple for me,
Great little to do list with reminders. I have it sync to my phone and my chrome browser,
Nice to do application. Love prediction phrases when we want to add to do list.,
Fantastic for getting my lazy self to do more things in a day.,
I'm actually getting things done!,
Feature requests: 1. Better resizing of widget. 2. Easier integration of voice dictation. 3. Calendar with custom task duration.,
Syncs well! All i ever needed. Just needs to go premium which is ok.,
Design really helps me stay on track and the points and awards encourage me to get things done!,
for alarm .it say we have to upgrade to premium..stupid app,
Any.do has more features in its free version.,
They really get it. They get the simplicity and ease of use people need.,
It's good app BUT every useful tool is not included on the free version :/,
The premium version is perfect! However I think the free version should have more basic features,
Great productivity platform. I feel the app's usability could be improved though,
Really boosted my productivity. I used to lie about on the sofa. Now I run the UN!,
Was searchin for this kind of app.. So much bettr to use..,
"An excellent tool, works very good on Samsung Galaxy S6. Thanks for your creative work !",

I'm a list person and todoist really helps me keep organized.,
"Just needs two more things: 1. ability to take notes in paragraph form, for projects, subprojects, etc, and 2. a little toggle for each task so that it can be labeled as ""active"", ""future"", or ""waiting"".",
I use this as a cross platform app. It does the business!,
No option to opt out of spam email,
"Keeps you organized, some features are behind a paywall.",
This is a great app for a great tool. The app works just as effortlessly as the website. It has got me keeping track of what I need to do and actually using my lists. Keep up the great work!!!,
Widget runs smoothly and app is clean looking and unobtrusive. 10/10!,
Great app with great portability. Use it everyday to keep track of my life.,
Great app to get things done and really inspires.,
Even better than Remember   the Milk.  Love it!,
"When I am sitting at my desktop Todoist and need to check off some tasks, I find myself reaching for my phone to work with those tasks with this app! That folks, says a lot!",
"I think the issue about the delay on sync with google calendar has been corrected, so I give you 5 stars.  Good job. 😃  ——–——–———— –——–———— –——–———— –——–————  I gave 4 stars bcos I noticed that it didn't sync with google calendar. Please check",
Best thing I've ever found for dealing with ADHD.,
You have to pay for reminders and other basic things.,

Easy to use. Minimalistic interface. Better than Any Do.,
Love this tool! No complaints whatsoever.,
Very intuitive software design. Clean interface and useful tool for improving productivity,
"Straight forward UI, Just needs a little bit of more controls and actions",
The app is great. However I wish the android app looked more like the chrome extension.,
It is a good app makes me organize my time and not to miss anything i will not pay the free version is enough,
"If it can show popup notification, it would be perfect.",
This is one of the best to-do apps in the market. Simple and it works.,
"Great app, easy to use, emails reminders, excellent",
From a todo app. Love it!,
"Fantastic app, easy to use, really helpful organizing tool, especially for freelancing!",
For an overbooked 20something with ADHD todoist is indispensable.,
The best productivity app on the market. Would be even better with evernote integration!!,
The best app I've used in terms of writing lists!!! It even auto-manages and categorizes the lists when you make them and you can also link it from your phone to your browser and email!!! Awesome. If I could rate,

In free version u can add reminder but WITHOUT actual notification. If you want to add notification you need to pay 34 dollars per year which I won't.,
"You can't even set reminders, if you want that option you have to pay monthly. I would have been okay with a one time payment.",
"Muy bueno para empezar a organizar tu día, estaría bien poder ver el calendario completo para ver todos los asuntos del mes.",
It works.,
Perfecto!,

:),
The usability is very good.  The email style to do handling is new to me but turns out quite effective.  If have to blame I wish there's more feature open for free version.  But without them it is still the best to do app I've used.,
"Tried many task app and I've found to doing to be the best. Synced online gives me the same updated copy anywhere. It has the 2 different recurring date feature ""every"" and ""after"". Postponing recurring task works as you think it should which is a constant pain point in other to do app. Tried the premium version for  year but the free version I found was sufficient for me.",
"So far I like it. Suggestions: I don't like the way the indent feature works on android and I would like an improved interface for scheduling recurring tasks instead of having to type out the whole keywords ""every"" and day of week. Right now the ios interface is better than android although I am on my android more often.",
"I've been using this app for almost a year and having the premium version, made me love it more. However, since I got my new phone(samsung galaxy note 5), the notification alerts stopped popping up unless the phone is being actively used. Reminders are very important in a to-do list app, if it doesn't get fixed soon, I don't think I'll be renewing my premium  account.",
"Overall i like the app a lot. Todoist is the only solution I've found that syncs with both my phone and my macbook, and also with Google calendar.  However the Android widget needs some work.  It wastes a lot of empty space and there's no way to show upcoming tasks without dividers (date, task type) between each.",
"Have used various cloud solutions for syncing task lists across different devices, all of my devices use different operating systems which has proved to be an issue with other cloud based todo lists. None even come close to offering the same features and simplicity that todoist has",
"This is one of the best ""to do"" apps I have found. The free version works just fine for my needs and there's no way I'd sign up for a subscription for this. That's crazy & too expensive. Really nice interface though, except the scheduling part. Its too complicated to have type in each day I want it to repeat. Just give me plain old checkboxes with each day of the week. Also a pull down that I can assign the task weekly, every 2 weeks, monthly, etc. And a scroller for the time. That would make it a 5 star.",
"Simple user interface but gets more in depth if needed.  The desktop/mobile combination is incredible, and one of the reasons I switched to Todoist. $30/year is a lot of money, but for right now, I'm willing to pay since it has made organizing for big events much easier. It would be nice if it had a little more flair, but I'm glad they got the app right instead of focusing on the look first then leaving the app a little weak like Wunderlist. Also, I love how I can add tasks right from my watch, huge plus!",
"Still working to learn the system to make entering subprojects, tasks,  and subtasks efficient. Not as simple or intuitive as I'd have hoped, but a solid app with great functionality otherwise.",
So far I'm loving it. I was looking for a to do list app with a simple yet usuful widget that shows my to do list simply and so far this seems to be it. Great. Probably the best to do list app out there right now.,
There are still few annoyances.           1. For example a label can not be changed/edited once you add a label.     to a task.                                                   2. Location based reminders do not work every time.                                     3. No category wise view available,
"Well designed, simple apps that have power user options integrated should you needed it. Best of the lot so far, and I've tried alot",
"I rely on this app to track my tasks at work on outlook, on my personal Gmail account and on my android. Works seamlessly across all platforms.",
For me the simplicity of this to-do list app is a real time saver allowing me to manage all aspects of my busy life.,
Would love a place to request features however. Like a monthly/weekly calendar display of events for project planning.,
I just started using it last week but it's extremely efficient to have a to do list where each item can be updated individually.   Started reading Getting Things Done and this is the perfect companion app so far.,
I've used a few applications of this kind.  I like Todoist because of all the features I get with the free version - especially the reocurring tasks.,
The app is easy to use I like how I can work with others on projects with this app.  It seems stable and looks nice.  It is all I want in a todo list.  I am not really a fan of subscriptions and would like to be able to just purchase it but that's OK for me.,
Love Todoist. I've tried tons of others but I always want to come back to this one. Well done.,
Helps me keep track of every the.  Despite a hectic schedule planned the task list always looks neat and is easy to read. Gentle learning curve. Very user friendly. Great job!,
"I've been using the app for a couple days now, not user friendly, have to fumble through to figure out how it works.  Wish it would automatically sync to watch.",
"The free app is great. Doesn't complete your tasks for you, but it's the next best thing. Wish the premium was a one time purchase or that there were levels of purchase. Not sure if it would be worth it for me.",
"I've used a lot of todo applications, abd this is by far the best. I even paid for the premium account, and I rarely spend money on apps :)",
"I download this before. But i deleted cause i think i can't. But now, it's time to change myself. I believe that i can do this. Thank you ToDoList.",
One thing its missing 4 me. Googlekeep lets you paste a paragraph and convert each break line to a new todo. Is great when wife messages you a large grocery list and dont have to input one at a time. Other than that I like the app. :),
"I love to try different apps and saas and I have very high standards, but this one is really one of my favorites.",
A very useful app that helps me to accomplish and not to miss my goals. Together with the web access provides a clear and effective view of my tasks. I love the Today view - the other apps miss that basic but absolutely important presentation of the todos. I bought the premium and now I have a complete life changing software.,
"I like how easy I can add projects and change its order, hierarchy and keep up with everything. I love to sync with browser version. Clear visualization helps task assimilation. Well done.",
"Good app, and my only current complaint is that if I don't pick a default reminder time it takes a while to set that. Otherwise a great app.",
I live the simple to use interface and the ability to scheduled my tasks. The email reminders are a nice added touch.,
"I really want to like this app. The widget is good. But I really don't like how difficult it is to view completed tasks. Maybe paid version is better, but will try others first.",
Overall very useful app. My only suggestion for improvement would be to reduce the steps it takes to add reminders etc.,
I love this app. It keeps me from forgetting important tasks large and small that I need to do now or later.,
"Not the most intuitive, it's a bit if an acquired taste :)",
"I looked at many other apps, which are confusing and take awhile to get used to . This app is very easy to use. Love it!",
"I love the simple, but powerful interface. The cross-platform support is also very nice. I switch between an Android phone and Outlook PC throughout the day pretty seamlessly.",
Great app for highly effective people! I wonder if this app can connect to google calendar so the tasks will also appear in calendar. Or maybe the the calendar display :),
"Great app, nicely designed and implemented. Keeps you both organized and motivated. Too bad the price tag for premium is a bit too high for me - and the free version too limited",
"I enjoying using it over numerous app for the purpose ... even the Free ver is ultimate, easy n user friendly",
"This app helps me keep organized and helps keep me on the right track daily. I highly recommend going Premium as the price is fair and the extras such as notifications, notes, email attachments, and labels are all wonderful tools that enhance user experience.",
The process of creating a sub task is burried quite deep and does not encourage the user to use it.,
Read above notes,
"Love that it syncs with my amazon echo using the website ""if this then that"" and that I can have multiple lists",
Have to create an account just to use. Wouldn't use if you want a simple to-do list widget,
"Easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and persistent reminders on varied platforms helps to keep me on track...and that's just the free version!",
I like this app for the most part. The areas that need improvement is when adding a task there should ask for what day. The home screen would be more useful if it showed the upcoming week and finally not receiving emails every day!,
Helps me stay organized and on track. Had some issue with the pc version but they seem to be resolved.,
"Simply said, the app may even be awesome, but forcing you to pay to get simple reminders on your phone is simply too much for me to handle. C'mon! This is a basic feature for any sort of task list!",
Its a cool application and i think if the notification feature is free maybe this app kill all the others apps. good job,
"Google has introduced an equally good if not better reminder system, integrated into its calendar, exactly what I need. I have no need for this app anymore.",
"Am using the free version. Very fast on phone & pc. Syncs instantly. Very easy to change order, categories, and due dates. I use it to keep track of everything.",
"Breaks up texts into subjects for easier search and tracking. Great work flow, mini CRM , and tasking too!",
I would not mind to pay a one-time fee for the premium features. I do not want to start a subscription and without premium the app bogs me about it all the time.,
Look no further than Todoist for the ultimate productivity tool.,
It's also changed the way I interact with my email. Highly recommend.,
"Always loved the simplicity / feature balance of todoist, and this app has that same level of care - a great UI on top of a fantastic tool!",
"I like that I just have to make one entry on phone, iPad, or computer and it carries over to the other two",
"Great way to organise my goals, daily planning and get myself organised the night before",
"This app really assist me to do daily tasks. Simply plan it, write it on app, and add reminder if necessary :)",
"I used a paper based GTD system and it was great, but cumbersome, and stopped doing it. This makes it easy. Great, clean, easy app. Only loses a star because of the subscription based premium feature! Who can justify that!",
"It's a good app, but many limitations it have. Set alarm for to-do is inapp purchase!!",
"It works fine as a to do list,  but the program management function is way to simple.",
Subcription fee instead of a simple one off fee is too expensive and forces me to look at alternatives,
Really makes one more productive. Easy way to track what you need to do.,
One of the best apps once you get into a routine of using it! I don't think i would go back to any others. It's universal on so many platforms which makes it very handy! Especially the add on with Outlook.,
The pretty design and useful function make it the best note app I've ever seen.,
It's simple user face makes it very simple to input task and complete them conveniently,
Great interface. Lightening fast sync. Super helpful customer support.,
"I'm trying it out, I'll let you know if I find it helpful after using it for awhile",
"I really like ToDoist as the functionalities provided are all made very easy to use and access. All. Shortcuts and methods to create activities, mark them done, time them, group them, etc, are all very well thought out. Great UX!!! My favorite to do list.",
Too many clicks to do things. Real estate hog.,
Has everything I need in a simple to do list a day more. Very user friendly and practical,
"Can use with echo, Motorola360 and Gmail all work smoothly. Can't live without it. Great job!",
"Best task and ""to do"" out there.  Easy to use and keeps my days and projects organized",
What could be more basic to a todo list than reminders? Every free todo app out there has reminders! Why would I use a todo list that forces me to pay a ridiculous annual fee for basic reminders?,
Very helpful and easy. Also it has several  ways to remind you.,
Let me start work next week and really see if this is for me..,
"I. Just. Love. Todoist. It has an beautiful UI, integrates well with sunrise my go to calendar app and it has amazing features even if you're a free user. Helps a lot and I like it very much. This is the first time I wrote a review for an app just because I want to support the developers who keep the app up to date and integrated with all the new apps and services. Thanks folks at Todoist this one is for you: ❤️",
The Gulf between the paid app and free app is too wide.  Perhaps a full-featured trial would help but I'm not seeing the cost justified yet...,
"This app is so easy to use. I place ""to-do's"" daily and check them off as I go! It gives you a kuddos at the end that makes you feel accomplished. Totally recommend!",
If you're going to cripple the single-most important feature of a ToDo list why have a free version at all? Reminders are a $ feature. A Todo list with no reminders is quite useless.,
This has changed the way I work. Many thanks!!,
"My favourite planner! It's the best one I've ever used, very simple and convenient",
Awesome app. Been looking for something like this for a long long time.,
I wish the price point on the more advanced features was less,
"I was searching along time for such an app,great gmail integretion!",
Excellent all round.,
Pretty simple to work.. Easy to. Seggerate different aspects as work or personal.,
Really good.  Could use some more features like weekly tasks with no deadline.,
My right hand man whenever my memory let's me down!,
It's very easy to use and technologically outstanding  application.,
Can't multitask,
I use it and so should U.,
"Great application, wish I could add pictures, but still very useful",
"Goos design, good UX, just works.",
Make it free or a bit cheap.,
Really like the simplicity and flexibility. Needs ability to sync with Outlook,
Even better now that I figured out how to integrate it with Tasker.,
Too bad experience,
Please add the ability to see the parent task in a subtask much like you do tags and projects,
"Well worth the price. Use for work, home, and my hobby.",
makes life easier with easy tracking of tasks,
Simple easy this use best one ive found,
Helps me easily and efficiently stay on top of tasks,
Very Helpful for getting my many jobs done,
Simple and appealing interface with numerous options to improve your productivity,
My productivity has increased 100 fold after downloading this app!,
Best list app.,
I especially like the fact that you can share projects with other users,
"Poor design, a labor to use. Uninstalled.",
Asking premium subscription for reminder on android device.,
I use this everyday. Thx Dev.,
"One of my favorite apps. Beautiful, simple design.  The latest iteration is absolutely wonderful. Simple but powerful.",
Great for organizing and scheduling.,
Super easy to set up.  Keeps me on track.,

"Lightweight, flexible and simple.",
Lots of great features. More than just a simple list.,

The app is extremely helpful,
I really liked the simplicity and the ui,
This app is really cool,
Excellent design and program,

Have been using app for a few days now. I like it so far but have not used all of its features. I love being able to sync with other devices.  Update: it has been nearly a year now that I have been using the app. I have upgraded to premium version mainly in appreciation to the developer.  I now find I use the app more than my calendar.  I receive reminders which are not annoying and it is easy to add items quickly.,
"Absolutely love how flexible this app is for to dos. You can keep things really basic and simple or get as complex as you like with adding tags etc. Would love to be able to change the priority, project, etc. of multiple selected to dos at the same time. Changing these properties on each individual task at a time can get tedious.",
"As many others, I like simple surface and it feels like the app can make me get my things done better than other methods I have tried. I am on trial for the premium version and think I might go for it when the free month is over, mostly for I do not want to have any limitations, and also because I think that paying for it will make me use it, and that might pay off quickly. Some things can be improved, though.",
"Still not perfect, but the best solution overall for my daily doing and it's constantly improving. Shortcuts and autocomplete are real time savers and sync across devices is flawless. Subtasks are still not handled well, though, as these are sometimes not directly connected to their parent tasks, which may lead to separation when changing due dates.",
"I was looking forward to using this app and exploring it's potential. Unfortunately, premium functions are unavailable to even test.  Instead of trying them, liking them, and deciding to upgrade... I feel as though I've been forced to go with a different app simply because I don't know how this one would help me. This approach really doesn't serve them well at all.",
Talk about organization and productivity. I love this app! So accessible and it can load on my google chrome and anywhere else I need it. (Ex. Just in case my phone is occupied by my daughter watching movies I can still see and complete my tasks.) My to do list can never get lost on a scrap of paper i used to write a quick note. The more I use it the more I'll know about all the features it offers to increase my productivity.,
"I think that is the thing I like about Todoist the most: it's a perfect tool for capturing items on the fly GTD style, but scalable enough to take on major projects. It has a wide range of applications: I use it on my android, inside my chrome browser, and even on my Windows desktop. Sleek, fast, and very easy to use.",
"Amazing app. Easy on the eyes design and the ease of navigating through the UI is what makes the app the best. It's just the best To-Do app that I've mange to find. There are a few problems that I personally have such as making tasks that have no date nor time appear somewhere I can remember. I'm sure that the premium version has a solution for these kind of tasks. Other than that small issue, the app never fails at making my day as productive as possible.",
"I've tried other ways to keep track of the myriad tasks I need to get done each day. This is the best, by far. It's easy to jot a note when I notice an issue I must address or an action item I have to do. Then, it shows up where I need it on the device - MacBook, Windows desktop, Android phone, or iPad - I'm using at the moment. It's interface is intuitive. Even better, the tracking features make it easy for me to get and stay motivated.",
"The biggest benefit to the app is its simple, light weight but comprehensive enough to meet the average Joe's needs.   I use it daily, love the quick add pull down. The plain English date setting feature is also a plus. Only thing I want is more evernote integration.",
"Works seamlessly across Mac and Android devices, updating within seconds. Nice scheduling shortcuts to speed up setting deadlines. Adding sub-tasks can be a bit clunky and awkward in the Mac app - no direct way of adding except new task, then indenting (much better in Android app). Overall pretty good.",
"I've been a Toodledo user on iPhone for years, but recently switched to Android and found the Toodledo Android app to be completely unreliable. I'm actually glad, because Todoist is far superior to Toodledo for task management. I've not only replaced Toodledo for personal tasks, but also Asana for collaborating and Outlook tasks at work. Todoist does it all, and it does it beautifully. Totally worth the annual fee.",
"I was using Google Keep to stay on top of tasks at work, but using this is a bit better in a few ways (in particular, the Windows program isn't just an embedded Chrome application, meaning my desktop arranging software knows how to open it correctly). Great alternative. Does all I need it to at this point in time. Being multiplatform is also a huge plus.",
I haven't used it more than a week so far but it seems to be doing what I wwnt - reminding me of my to do list. It is pretty simple but I almost wish there was a tutorial because some things like 'karma' don't make sense. Otherwise it's nice!,
"Works flawlessly. Because it syncs so quickly accross my three devices (android tab, iphone, pc)  I use it not only for tasks, but also for reference data (using ""Notes"")  that i might need quickly on one or another device . Very easy to customize and use. ""Labels"", Filters"" and Search cababilities are especially useful.",
I love using this app! However I'm currently using a OnePlus X and every time I try to add a task it tells me that projects can't have more than 200 tasks. I've never end encountered this issue before on other Android or ios devices. Not sure if it's an phone specific bug or not.,
"Great job on bells and whistles, but comes up short on fundamentals:  all tasks must be assigned to the inbox or a project (special purpose lists must be projects); no bulk edits; data cannot be exported.  This is just a front end to the web app.  The free version is useless; you will have to pay the annual fee.",
So far this app has helpedme keep track of the myriad of day to dayy tasks I have to do. Not really into the karma points system but I suppose it can be a motivator... I'll upgrade shortly and see how the full package works,
"This is a great to do app. It has all the functionality with time or location based reminders, reoccurring tasks, projects, lists and possibly best of all, if you do get stuck, find a problem or just need a hand with the app, the support you get is first class. I'm on my second year of premium subscription now which probably speaks more than me banging on about features.",
"I hardly ever take the time to rate an app, cause let's face it, who wants to take the time? I had to rate Todoist because it really is that good. I've used a lot of to do type apps over the years and never keep using. It's been a couple of years, so thought I'd try again, with one major requirement, it had to work across my iPad, Android phone, and Win desktop computer. I paid for Todoist to get at all the features and wow! So quick to enter a task. You can just type ""sign contract tom at 5"" and its done!",
"Clean, powerful, cross-platform and actively maintained. The android app (one of the many platforms, and they all sync seamlessly) makes full use of your device abilities. You may attach photos to the tasks, use location-based notifications, or display a widget with a certain view of tasks.  I used to rate it 5 stars, but now I think I would look for an alternative if I was to start over again. The company in recent months introduced features that break the functionality (like the input control in web interface that have problem with long descriptions or heuristic metadata recognition that works poorly and can't be turned off). Also, they seem to ignore the voice of many customers on the support forum. The product is still nicely engineered, but I'm not sure if I continue my premium subscription with this approach.",
"Started using TODOist a week ago after six months with Evernote Premium.  So far I find it easier and more intuitive than Evernote. I haven't abandoned Evernote yet, but TODOist is definitely on par if not better. Will rate TODOist again after 1 month trial.",
"Superb app, backed up with web access and chrome extension. Have been trailing for a week or so. Evernote compatibility is great and flows well. Will keep investigating but will probably upgrade for the extra tweaks in due course.",
I like the app but when 9am comes around and it chimes every morning and I can't get it to stop. I sleep during the day and I hate when it wakes me up. I could turn off the phone but then I wouldn't hear my work calling me. Kinda stuck with what you got. If I could mute it then I'd give you 5 stars,
"Had trouble keeping track of tasks and organizing them. This really helps a lot. Love the multiplatform application of it as well so it's always with you. :) great job guys. If we can see a history of tasks completed though, that'd be cool! Other wise great stuff!",
"I have tried lots of todo  lists,  but like Goldilocks,I think they are either too simple or too difficult. Todoist strikes the perfect balance: all the features I want, and very quick and easy to use. And it's available on everything that I might want to use it on.",
"Looked like a good To Do list app at first but is wrought with shortcomings. 1) Any feature that matters is a premium feature which requires an expensive subscription. 2) YOU CAN NOT EXPORT YOUR DATA!!! Its another ""PREMIUM FEATURE"".  3) Dont try using the Mac desktop version of the app from the countryside. The desktop version of the app is nothing but a container for the browser-based web app. Thus, when you try to see your list from , say, a ski house, you will not see anything at all unless you have an internet connection.   4) The Android version of the app does not use screen space in an efficient manner. If you have a dozen items in your list, you wont be able to see whats coming up without scrolling.   5) Every time you press the wrong button, you get a pop-up window telling you that it is a premium feature button. The premium buttons are  annoyingly located next to the  buttons you actually need! 6) You can't type in a date due to the apps mandated ""intelligence."" Make a note to buy a christmas gift tomorrow and it pushes out the due date to December 25th! There is no user option to turn this off. They tried to be smart and became stupid!",
"Great app! Very easy to use and I love the fact you get that Chrome extension for desktops too :) My favourite to do list app. It's simple enough, yet not lacking in features. I found Google Keep too much of a note-taking app rather than a to do type app.  The recurring reminders here are very easy to set up! Just type ""every weekday"" or ""every sat"" or something along those lines!",
"I started using it for work but then added my personal errands and then Girl Scouts projects, etc. This app can help organize your entire life and minimize that chaotic ""running list in your head"" experience. You do have to use it religiously, adding *every* to-do item to it& adding a date, a parent task, &/or a priority. But once you're in the habit it works like a charm.",
"I've tried a lot of to-do apps but keep coming back to this one. Just enough features to be useful, not too many to over complicate things. Latest version of the Android app has a great interface.  Only con, the inline parsing in the web version is finicky and annoying.",
"It's a good idea, but it's an idea already done. You can achieve the same purpose this app does by using Google now or Google keep, quite simply and seamlessly as well. I'm lost at how this app sets itself apart from the rest of the market.",
"It started out great and I used it constantly. But about six weeks ago I tried to put in a new item and it wouldn't let me. I thought it needed an update so I made sure it was up to date. Same problem. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Same problem. I had if.tt connected, it is no longer connected. I'm disappointed that it won't work.",
"I've been a long time proponent of Outlook tasks, and hadn't tried anything else for years. Graduating to Todoist is like going from a tricycle to a spaceship. Mobile support, date processing, task assignment and sharing, etc. are all much better on Todoist.",
"This App looks good. But I think the below problem need to be fixed. I created some task and assigned to some one else (collaborate). Though I have created and assigned the task, it shows up only in another person's device in the next 7 days list but not showing on my device, I too have equal responsibility and want to see what is planned for next 7 days",
It doesn't tell u before u download that u have to pay 30 for a year of the extras. My paper note pad will do much better. Rediclouse! !!            Reply to reply..... look at the tick tick app or gtask. Or other apps. Can get it cheaper and alot of other apps have ur paid features  for free.,
"One of my have-to-have apps. I love the reminder by location feature. It makes it much easier to remember to do something when I arrive at home or to work, compared to traditional time controlled reminders which tends to be dismissed if delays. Keep it up!",
"I have ADHD, and I've always wanted a tool exactly like this. I thought I would have to create a to-do list tool myself because nothing else ever worked for me, but this is beyond what I could have designed specifically for myself. I can finally think with a clear conscious again. Thank you!",
Although still finding my way around this app it is helping me remember important things. Havent been able to effectively plan ahead. If this doesnt exist it needs to added cos i cant find it. Otherwise great app.,
"I used Remember the Milk for several months before this, but kept having buggy things happen with my repeating tasks. No issues so far after a week with Todoist! I'm loving the interface. Keep it up!",
Don't know these apps are getting high rating. Google must do something about this,
Really like this app and how easy it is to use. The videos are easy to follow when setting up. I've used both basic and pro versions. My favorite list app I've ever used... and this is probably my 5th or 6th one.,
"I started using this app 5 days ago, and can already feel that the app and I are going to have a long term relationship! I have a forgettable short term memory (pun intended!) and todoist has helped me plan and follow up more effectively, and really, get things done.",
"Todoist has the best combo of features and simplicity. Flexible enough to allow for customization, but simple enough to keep you focused on the tasks. It also has a great accessibility from any device. I have tried quite a few task systems and I always come back to Todoist.",
"Greatly polished experience. Sometimes a bit resistant towards my preferred mode of work. Delete date action hidden behind three taps? Omg, dislike, uninstall. JK, excellent work guys.",
"I use it everyday. School work, work work, shopping lists, projects, and checklists. The interface is minimalist yet functional and is the best task manager I have used after a very long time searching for something that works this well. GTD compatible.",
Its ability to sync across multiple platforms is awesome (e.g. web browser chrome extension),
Todoist is by far one of the most intuitive to do list applications I've ever worked with.,
The desktop version is miles better but at least it syncs up. The mobile version has all the same features but it's awkward to use,
I am an organization freak and this has solved so many problems for me. The outlook integration is a life changer. And the quick add tool makes it seamless to add tasks. So user friendly and intuitive.,
This is a very good way to do it. The more I use it the more productive I am.,
"Easy to get started but seems like most of the really useful stuff is behind the paywall. Still does what I need it to do. I also like the ""karma"" gameification element. Makes it a bit more fun to run my errands and get stuff done at work. If only there were perks at the different levels?",
"Love this app.  What would make it perfect is being able to EASILY turn my emails into tasks.  If I use the share menu, it puts the whole email in as the task title.  IMHO, it should put the email subject as the task name, and the email content as the comment.  Any chance this can be fixed?",
"Todoist app (unlike Web version) somehow lack of an important feature (sort options), quite surprise why this hasn't been implemented after so long. Otherwise, 5 stars in future when this is implemented.",
What good is a to do app if when you have more than a few items but there is no way to sort anything by date or by priority.   Widget just displays items in the order you entered them.  Not very useful.  Disapointed.,
"I love the app. The karma feature is a neat incentivisation for coming back to the app which differentiates it nicely. However the app crashes more frequently than I would like, particularity when accessing the aforementioned karma feature. (Samsung Galaxy S6).",
"Has truly become a lifeline for getting things done, particularly with calendar syncing and outlook extension. Just brilliant!",
"Wish the reminders and more themes were available in the free of charge version,  despite being very limited, it's still satisfying",
I'm forgetful. This helps me forget less. Or re-evaluate the time scale of my work.,
This is worth a download. Easy to learn and the email reminders are helpful. The only downside so far is that the interface for making sub tasks is a bit awkward but you can easily make sub projects instead.,
"Relatively easy to use, nice interface too.  I can't tell the difference between the free and the paid version",
I always downloaded multiple to do list and never keep up with it.  This one is easy and smarter than all the rest.,
"Sure they have some features missing, but the things they have are powerful. They are on every platform. This is the only task manager system in the game that has all the features it has.",
"Love this app, it's so easy to use and has been invaluable to me. As 8 have THE worst memory ever.",
By far the best todo app. Available on many platforms and has a lot of features. I only wish they can add pomodorro support with a timer.,
Great app.  Love it's ease of use and colour coding. Looking forward to the free month's upgrade to premium. Some personal niggles with reminders behaviour but it's early days for me wit this app and my new phone.,
App was a little bit difficult to use at first. Once you figure out the process it is very handy,
"The only to-do list that has ever helped me to do what has needed to be done,  so perfect.",
Have begun to use this app as a start to get my life on track. The journey has been good as of now . Please incorporate option of viewing completed tasks.,
"Great app for tracking tasks, improving productivity and getting things done. Cross platform support is excellent for managing tasks and productivity at any time and on the go, at home, or at work.",
"Overall, I love the app. The home screen widget seems to have issues updating from day to day, but it's not a deal breaker.",
What a waste of my time.  Could just use a paper list.  This app just wants you to buy premium where all the good stuff is at.  Incorrect description in app profile.,
"Great app, very useful! I only wish that the widget allowed for more tasks to be seen at once. The blank space around the text for each task is excessive.",
"Good. It got me going.  But i want my widget to display all tasks, regardless of what category they are in.",
It's a todo list i like the most but you should add scheduled tasks(task that repeat each week for example) and the option to assign a task to multiple collaborators inside a project. This would really distance you from your biggest competitor any.do to do list,
"After using multiple task lists (Google, outlook, Yahoo), I always come back to Todoist because it's the one that works best for me.",
"Love it, but wish it was more aware of me completing tasks on other devices, the Android app is often out of sync. And gutted that Thunderbird is no longer supported on PC. Is a good reminder of my day, right on my phone.",
Before using a planner I struggled to keep up with the workload I have in a day. But while using todist I was able to know what I was supposed to be doing and exactly when I was supposed to be doing it.,
"I used to be  Remember the Milk & Wunderlist user before I tried Todoist.    Not only is Todoist available for anything I use, all the apps look great!",
Only issue I have rt now is the widget stops working. Have to keep reloading it.,
It is complicated. Major options available only if upgraded. Need internet connection to function properly. All in all the last thing i need to further complicate my life,
This has all of the things i have been looking for since my out of milk app went belly up with an update last year. .,
"Very useful, use this all the time. Only complaint is more of a personal preference: the premium-only features are still visible on the free version, and are somewhat distracting. Not a big problem though.",
Todoist has the easiest interface and the most intuitive mobile and desktop personal project management that I have found.,
"It's a great idea, and task manager app, but it would be great if the widget wouldn't take up all of my screen and had more content, or at least I could resize it. Having only 3 tasks listed wastes my screen real estate.",
"Just like the description, super easy to get in and out of which for me makes it relevant for daily to do's.",
I'm not paying $40 PER year just for an app that works a bit better than the free one that comes with my phone.,
Very handy to set recurring reminders at set intervals. Also super simple to split between work and home so I don't have to worry about the two groups mixing together.,
"Seriously. I can organize by project, set deadlines, and also rearrange tasks super easily. So awesome!",
This app has everything you'd ever want. It manages and keeps track of everything perfectly. The coding is really well done too and it basically keeps track of your data over the website too. This is really cool.,
"I used Todoist a while ago, and found it clunky and not convenient.  I had the opportunity to get a free premium subscription through AppSumo, so I tried it again.   Wow, I am glad I did!  Todoist has greatly improved for my usage, and I now love it, using it every day.  Fantastic app!",
"Every platform supported which is great. I have it on my phone, windows, gmail and chrome. All fully functional so there are no compromises.",
"A good app that helps you set tasks, priorities, and achieve them. Could wish for better connection with google chrome and gmail apps.",
Love this app. Works the way I do on projects and allows quick entry of  tasks. Integrates with Outlook and has a Chrome extension so I can add jobs easily from other websites.,
In the week that I've had this I really like the Outlook setup since that is where I spend a lot of time. It makes adding and managing really easy. I also like the location feature where it can remind me when I leave work or arrive some place that I have something to do. To get full use you need the premium option.,
"When there will be more friendly option to create subtasks implemented, for example using drag and drop to subtask the added task.",
Its great so far (I really like the choose when its due feature) but I would like to see it available in more sizes as a widget. A 2x2 or 2x3 is ideal for me and the existing size is very large.,
This app really assists me in keeping myself organized. It is an awesome addition to my phone and I use the widget with it often to add tasks to my to do list.,
The best one so far. I'm planning to upgrade to premium account just to support you :),
I found this app while looking for a compatible  to do list that would sync with my Galaxy note 5 and Google. Thanks for a great and useful  application.,
"Does everything I want it to as a free app. Set tasks, reminders appear as notifications the day something is due. Very easy to set reminders and check off items that have been completed.",
"This is the simple app that keeps me on track every day. With the widget on my Android, the Chrome plugin at work and the Mac app at home my projects are always at my fingertips.  In full honesty I only use the free version but this is something that I would have no problem paying for.",
But Subscription cost is a little steep for me. Wish I could just buy the thing and have it permanently instead if just for a year. Nevertheless it is a great app.,
"Essential features like notifications are in premium, so cannot say much without going pro. Date entry seems fun, tom and tod is interpreted as tomorrow and today.",
I love it. It keeps me on task. I only wish they had a log for completed task,
I've tried Todoist in the past but never really liked its Spartan interface. Now the material design update has captured my attention. The service is very functional and creating and editing tasks is easy. My only critique is you can not create new tags when editing a task. You must create a new task to make new tags. Otherwise fantastic.,
I've tried several to do list apps and this is by far is the best I've found.  It keeps getting better with new releases. I just renewed my Premium subscription for the 3rd year.,
I have the free version and am happy with the features and how it makes my day to day life easier.,
"Need to be able to scroll, tick, postpone to dos within an Android wear app rather than always having the notification cards there. Notification cards are in a random order.",
For anyone with a busy job trying to balance family and work this is a life saver. Worth getting full version for the 'tags' feature.,
Wonderful sync between your computers and mobile devices. No ads what soever. Very nice and very clean yet powerful. Many functionalities are built into this app. I am very happy with it.,
"I just wish that they would update the Android Wear version. It's outdated, they are even still using the old logo for it.",
Cross platform make job very ease. Assign a job to other.share project. Due date work on same principal as in industry.,
As a busy mum of three and business owner I depends on Todoist to ensure that I stay on top of everything.  I've used lots of different programs and never stuck to them long but I LOVE Todoist. I've been using it for over a year and I wouldn't use anything else,
It would be better if recurring task and reminders have except option available.   example for recurring task - every day except on 01-04-2016 or example for reminders - every 4 hours except 11pm to 6 pm,
I've tried a number of time management programs and Todoist always astounds me with its excellent well thought out design.,
Simple and clean to use. Free features are sufficient but premium is even better!  Premium is too expensive for subscription and doesn't have a one time buy option :(,
Just have the free version...but love it! Best tool to keep me organized that I have used... I love the the button to add emails automatically to my list. I will likely upgrade yo premium eventually!,
"This app is simple to use, keeping the interface and feature set appropriately easy to access, but robust enough to be genuinely helpful in everyday life.",
"Good, but the best resources are unavailable in the free version.",
Have had only good experiences with the app on mobile versions. Love that it syncs seamlessly and quickly across multiple devices and it's so straightforward to use.,
Best integration and design that I've seen so far.. def worth the extra cash for the premium version 😃,
"I have tried many apps over the past year. However todoist seems to be my favourite. It is very simple and powerful, especially the UI.",
It's a good app for a simple todo list.  My only problem was I had to turn off the automated date extractor since it was pulling dates out of my items incorrectly.,
"I've been through half a dozen to-do apps.  This is the one that works for me.  Everything I need in the basic version, will upgrade soon for some bells and whistles.",
It makes being organised so much easier I use it in combination with outlook and it helps me stay on top of my work!,
"The app is user friendly, easy to understand and very reliable. Its the only to do app i have actually liked.",
"Todoist's To Do list service helps you stay organized and on task. The service  includes the website and the app, both are simple to use. For a free App it is very good. Bottomline, I do recommend Todoist for anyone looking for a to do list app.",
"I use this app to use Todoist on my Galaxy S6 running Lollipop. Works well and includes a decent widget. It'd be awesome if the app and widget could be customized further, especially font size.",
"Great app and lifesaver, but could do more in terms of scheduling events like for I could not schedule a task for calling my grandfather every alternate/3rd day etc. Wish I could do that. But great job overall. Keep it up... :)",
"I've tried many other todo apps, and this is the best app if you have to manage multiple campaigns or projects.",
"Super easy and powerful app. I'd give 5 stars if the widget were customizable. I'd like smaller font options, it takes up way too much space.",
Great app that's easy to use and super functional.  Still wish ctrl n created new line like it used to.,
"Astounding! Not as diverse as Evernote but rather, more specific. Far more tailored to my needs",
I don't know why it took me so long to give it a try but now this app makes life much easier. I use this app everyday all day.,
"I switched from a spreadsheet tool I had been using previously to this. I wish it had the ability to show more information with less whitespace as an option. I do appreciate being able to organize multiple levels, unlike other similar products.",
If you need a reminder that works - this is the one. I already forgot what is missing an appointment or an assignment. Really like it. I give it a 6 stars.,
"Love the app! Visually pleasing, intuitive to use, and has lots of awesome features. Its simply perfect for managing your everyday tasks. I use Google Keep for quick notes. And Todoist for tasks. Perfect combo. Don't think anyone will be disappointed with Todoist.",
"The time doesn't sync well, the time is always two hours late. Any help is welcome.",
"Very clear, no frills, just do what you want to do, create to dos and check them when done. Deadlines etc all standard features included.",
"I love this app! I am able to list all of my tasks, move them around to different says, save them for later, and (of course) check off when i am done with a task. I have the free version and it does exactly what I want.",
Long time user of anydo with their dark theme. Really want to switch but cant stand the light theme.,
"Easy to use, has what I need, great UI, and not bogged down by unnecessary features.",
"Excellent productivity tool.I have't found a usefor labels yet, but I supose I will. I'd definetly suggest sincronizationwith Google Calendar, can't imagine why this isn't included. Everything elseworks perfectly.",
"I love that I can access on my phone, tablet and on work and home pc. I also like that I can categorize my tasks. Havent tried syncing to my calendar yet but will try. I dont forget ""todo"" anything anymore.",
I use it on my desktop and smartphone and it's excellent. Very simple to use and does everything I need to do. I definitely recommend it!,
Best productivity app around. Love the way you can make a task reoccurring everyday - now I will never miss a prayer! Thanks,
I like the reminders but haven't quite figured out how to do all of the features.,
"This task management app has everything I need... reminders, a web interface to use on my computer, a nice UI, a gmail plug-in, a widget, and if I add a task by email it retains any attachments. Kudos!",
Very good Apps are available freely than this one,
I don't like the constant email reminders though because many tasks I set don't need to be done that day,
This is a very good tool. I'm still learning it but find it all encompassing.,
It's worth the premium version. Requesting all to give it a try. It's literally the best and the most useful software.,
Just got it a week ago and it has been very functional for me and my employees.,
Get's things out of my head onto more convenient medium,
Swapped from Wunderlist because that was buggy despite me sending feedback again and again. Todoist is far superior even with just the free version,
"It's awesome. It replaces your reminders, calendar and to-do Apps.",
I started using this app 6 months back after using many other task management apps. It is essential for my task management now. Easy to use and boosts productivity. I highly recommend it.,
This app has certainly improved significantly over time and I think the developers deserve the support for bringing a productivity app that is truly pleasing to use and effective at its purpose.,
Hey it is a great tool to keep chaos at bay!,
Great app that allows me to stay organised! Also very smooth interface that allows for easy access and removal of tasks.,
Setting reminders is quite a task... The app isn't easy to use,
"Really cool app. Still missing some functions, like batch editing tags.",
Insanely helpful and streamlined app.  Definitely boosts productivity.  Always adding new features and apps you can connect.  Keep up the great work!!,
Many to do apps are complicated.   This is not.  Bonus: it works!,
The free version is awesome as it is...i think I'll buy the full version soon as well... There is scope for improvement too.. Maybe an autosave feature is useful,
Really like the functionality and integration with Android Wear. 5 stars if they add an agenda function to Wear,
"Great app. However, Adding tasks from my widget does not get updated in the list. Have to update from the app itself. Hope they fix this bug soon!!",
If you feel there are little tasks that you just always forget then get this app.,
"Works on multiple platforms, very easy to use, powerfull features.",
I use this app for making my own to do lists and task tracking on projects. As each project can have its own email address I can BCC the project when assigning a task by email and then follow up on it outside outlook by checking them off on DOIST.,
Quick and easy to use. Love it is available on all devices I use.,
Perfect for a minimalist who wants to get things done.,
"I need a ""to do list"" to stay organized and productive and this does the job.  It was a little pricey for the upgraded app.",
"The best to-do list app I've used so far. Just 1 thing, how to turn off the reminder by email?",
I use this on my phone and tablet. It communicates seamlessly. Wish I had found it earlier!,
"It's very good app, helped me to complete works in effective way.",
Little laxk of usibility in mobile app. I use a lot of nested tasks and this could use an improvwment.,
"Even in the free version, the features allow you to use it as a great management to fit GTD. Loved it!",
would like a smaller more compact widget. Theres too much white space.,
I like it very much.  Would be better if we can put time intervals for a certain task,
"Hi, this app has features which support to manage your work and full planning for future activities.",
"Full of distractive, nonessential fluff.",
It makes it easy to get your tasks done each day especially those daily repeating one.,
I use this every day to stay productive.  So far no tech issues.,
"Don't like cloud stuff, we all don't have data to the heavens.",
Found this app to be a little better then Google calender reminders. Easy to use with great reminders.,
Full featured task list. Love the labeling system and priority settings. Design is great too.,
...option to assign project to a task in quick-edit is missing. Also autocomplete of label should be added,
I like this app but not enough to pay the subscription fee. I was able to find another app that was everything this is and only pay for it once,
"Easy to use, great widgets, fantastic look and very useful.",
Perfectly simple and easy to use - makes a world of difference.,
"Please add sort alphabetically feature, whether it was on projects or on to do list",
I think there should be an alarm to remind you to do work,
"Very user friendly, easy a to use and helps to manage life easily.",
It's got everything you would ever want in a task editor.,
Use it everyday.. Helps keep me organized ... No more piles of paper and forgetting my list at home,
Finally found a good app for task scheduling!! Just started using it today but I love it already,
"Its functions are complicated and not intuitive enough. As for GTD tool, it's not as good as Doit.im.",
Became awesome when a friend showed me how to attach pictures as a comment.,
Amazing! Boosted my productivity more than Any.do and Wunderlist!,
"Simple, elegant, easy to use and extremely efficient. Syncs perfectly between the mobile and on the laptop. Very useful.",
"App looks great, is fast and crisp, and mirrors all the website/web app's functionality. You can make basic lists, or use labels and filters to add sorting, filtering, and the ability to dive into specifics. Sharing, comments, and file attachments are simple and work well. The natural date language cannot be beat. I recommend the premium account for the useful extra features and support. Don't be a cheapskate, you'll spend more on dinner tonight. Get all the chrome extensions, too, the gmail one is great!",
I'm definitely going to get the full version of this app,
Wish it had smaller widgets. Im using samsung galaxy s6.,
"In the meantime, best task list ever",
One of the best productivity tools in the market. I'm loving it.,
At the top of a very long LIST of todo list apps!! Great widget.,
Best cross platform project manager I've found. Paid subscriber.,
"Very useful, sonmamy ways to organize. Plz dont change too much ♡.",
An awesome to-do app with handy features. Recommended for all.,
It's awesome app better if it's used a premium version.,
I have greatly improved my productivity with the help of this tool.,
"Seamlessly syncs with email, just a daily reminder.",
"Simple to use but not simplistic.  It functions well for managing projects. So far, I'm pleased.",
A nice productivity tracker/list maker.,
"I tried many do list apps, finally i found an app am happy with! Vety fast, very simple, very helpful. Thank you developer, 5 stars and proud!",
I have been looking for something that would do all that I want....   and this is it!,
"Best productivity app period, paid for premium and it's absolutely worth it",
"Goodbye pen and paper, hello Todolist!! I really like that I can set reminders to my notes and share the to do's with others for collaboration!!!",
"Very easy to handle, no ads and featured with notification. Very good",
Now I can capture to-dos on the fly no matter where I am. Well done!!,
Would love to see start date added as option. Worth paying premium for that.,
Very very helpful to remember everything I need to do.,
"It does its work perfectly, no fuss",
"Great app smooth, spacious display better than other task apps",
The best app for task management. I am using it from 2008,
"Take the time to learn the system, and you will acomplish what you want to acomplish in the day!",
Great app for creating simple or complex to do lists.,
Great compatibility and snyncability across platforms. I personally have used it on Android ios and windows.,
"Well designed, easy to use...I use it for everything now",
Very little friction to getting my work done!,
My tasks automatically getting removed. Why cant I access completed tasks,
I try a lot of apps in this category and I've found nothing better. Clean and simple.,
I really enjoy that they send email notifications.,
Scheduling tasks was so quick! Liked the minimalistic design.,
Without Premium version it's useless and with Premium version it's too much expensive.,
Simple and easy to use.  I love how you can schedule task and set reminders.,
"Could use constant notification reminder. Otherwise, very good.",
Great app.  Helping to keep me organized.,
"I think it's super convenient, easy to use, and I like all the notifications.",
Once you get going it's an excellent program,
Getting stuff done like a boss! 👍,
"Without any doubt, it's the best of the bests.",
Can't ask for anything better!,
New versions task adding is not intuitive,
Easy to use and understand!,
"Easy to understand how it works, great app!",
I gives 3 stars cause I have to pay in order to get 5 stars,
I like how the app reminds me of overdue tasks,
Helps me finish my task everyday,
So far its  working great for me,
A great app for organizing your life.,
So far I like that is helps keep me on track,
As the subject days,
This app is basically the sole reason I get anything done,
Free version is useless. Premium version is excellent,
The free version is still very useful and does not annoy asking you to go premium,
Does a great job helping you prepare a detailed to do list.,
Simple and straightforward. Type what u need to do and tick when u done it.,
"If I can't stay on track using this app,  then I don't know what else I can do. Easy to use, easy to customise, reminders everywhere, and it runs on every device and platform I use. Web,  mobile, tablet, watch.... Recommended.",
"Can't test notifications, comments, any of the features that i need. Put a time limit on it, or some other kind of method, that would allow me to find out if this is what I'm looking for. Too bad.",
really good for taking notes on the tasks and usable notifications everyday,
Productive boost!,
Still exploring....   I think the pro version has some useful features.,
Keeps me on my toes!,
I really like the collaboration.  Thanks!,
Love it so far! Trying to learn all the screens. Awesome app! Thanks!,
super task management program ! keeps Me on traCK !,
"Easy to use, khudos to developer!",
Best task management tool ☺. Expecting more features.,
How about adding a function to repeat a listing for x times over so many days/weeks or months?,
Simple easy and just wish I can add sub task but not everything can be free,
I like these easy to use to do list app that syncs with my sunrise calendar,
Title says it all.,
But it is the best.,
But I like any.do better tbh,

Increased my productivity.. Thank you team,
I love the way it integrates with gmail.,

This app is a big help for me in managing my time  ♥♥,
"Great features, clean design, pretty much perfect",
Reminders should be included in free version. Rest is perfect.,
Took random chaos and started creating order.,
Great but...wish it would let you do bulk (un)tagging 😢,
Keeps me coming back for more :),
Very simple  & easy to use,
Great app for helping me to be more organised.,
Much better than any todo I have used.,
"I haven't found the perfect, for me, to-do app, but Todoist is darn near there!",
So far so good!,
É um dos meus aplicativos favoritos!,
Title speaks for itself.,
GTD integrated cross platform amazingness!,
Good but many features are behind a pay wall,
I use it every day and it is only getting better,
Could improve it with sound notifications,
All my tasks in one place,
Easy to use and can sync on multi device,
This is so helpful to keep me straight!,
Does everything it needs to do. Great.,
Amazing!,
Just started using it and I am hooked!,
The app I use the most,
"Simple interface, quite intuitive to use",
But its not give me notifications,
I use it everyday!,
Not bad at all! Simple but useful!,
Well done and easy to use.,
"Syncs across my phones, Web browsers, and laptop.. It's perfect!",
Works everywhere too.,
I can easily organize my tasks,
Helps me with work thinking of getting premium just need to know if the completed task go by date order instead all in one list,
Good to see my tasks on my mails,
Great tool keeps me focused and organized helps me remember what to do I can put it on the side of my browser wow is just that good,
Easy to use and nice interface.,
The reminders are extremely helpful!,
I've gotten a lot more done since I started using this app!,
Help me to stay focused,

Says what it does on the tin and does it well!,
Everything I needed from task manager,

I love this app. It's so sexy.,
Syncs to Google aka my whole world,

Broken app.,
"Neat, cool, just right.",

O app propícia uma excelente organização através de uma interface simples e intuitiva. Além de prover de notificações quando você esquece de cumprir algo.,
"La mejor aplicación, muy práctica y multiplataforma, super recomendada. Con la adición de la funciones avanzadas se hace mucho más fácil de usar.",
no reminders,
Mooooi,
Works,
"Para quem precisa de agendar e organizar suas actividades tem aqui boa aplicação. O único problema é para aceder a uma boa parte de funcionalidades tens que fazer upgrade para a versão premium  (business estratégia,  nada contra).",
Ok,
Overall the app is good but as it stands the app is mainly used by people with semi professional needs in time and task management. Which leads me to the biggest issue with the app which is the user friendly interface it is missing.,
"Productivity is through the roof now. I never forget anything Im asked to do. The android wear app needs to work when both it and phone on same network and then 5 stars, my favourite app of this year, pipping evernote to the post.",
"I have been able to sync my tasks to all devices and apps, I use for work. It's versatility and it's feature set is awesome. I went premium within 24 hours of using it.",
"Would love there to be a simple way to schedule activities for different days of the calendar. It would be easier for me to be able to pick a day and then jot down all activities for that day, instead of writing the tasks and having to schedule them one by one.",
"Simple but robust. Karma feature is icing on the cake. I like gamafication. Just try it. I've used them all. I purchased the full version after using the app for one day. Why? Because the designers know what's important, and the app makes that apparent.",
"Great Task App! Love the Outlook and Gmail integration! I have a computer, Apple, Android and Android Wear devices and thus is the best app to work across them all!",
"Xperia C very useful app and user friendly, download this app to be organised",
"Works beautifully, syncing is near instant.",
Organise your life in an effective way,
Good,
"This is the best to-do list app out there, comfortable, efficient and simple. Only complaint I have is that I could not see the instructions for how to write the correct dates. Also, it would be appreciated if you would make it possible to make a task that is due multiple times a day, like ""brush teeth three times a day"".",
I like the app and would totally go pro but I really dislike this trend of monthly/yearly subscriptions. With these types of apps it should be a one and done situation. I don't like thinking if I cancel my subscription I lose a perfectly good app and all my hard work. Better luck next time.,
"I spent a lot of time trying out every ToDo app I could get my hands on.  I did have to upgrade to the premium version to get all the features I needed but it has been worth every penny.  I work in IT and am constantly needing to add things quickly to my lists as needs arise.  Todoist makes adding, prioritizing, and managing work and personal lists quick and easy.",
"Swipe functions, projects, sub tasks, sharing, smart scheduling input, let's me get really into goal breakdowns, which I like. The karma is also a fun gameful feature but my favorite part of the data analysis is the ""last 7 days"" bar chart that's color coded so you can see what project you've been focused on.",
"They claim to have subtasks... After  trying 6 different platforms I only found one way to create a ""sub task"" using android platform. This so called subtask was just a new task that was indented and was not at all a sub task of another task. There are pleanty of other to do list apps that allow you to use sub tasks correctly. I would not waste my time with this one if that is what you are looking for.",
"Really good app, with lots of integrations that help me stay organized even in my worst days. I'm not giving 5 stars because of the unstable releases some times (there are versions that stay unstable for a week or even more), and not having a native Linux version. Support is adequate but answers lack some technicalities that would great to have.",
Its competitors set the bar pretty high. Syncing labels integration are not premium features that's par !! Selling an active development team directly seems much smarter. Apple and google take forever to iron out small details. Lower the fee sell it on its active dev team that is premium,
I'm a chronic list maker and hoarder of information and Todoist is the best app for me. I use the desktop quick add tab ALL THE TIME when I am surfing the net and I like being able to have the same info available to me when I'm mobile. I don't have a premium account but I wouldn't mind trying it. Worth a try if you've been looking for the right fit for lists.,
"This is just what I needed. There are two things on my wish list that would make it 5 star: (1) the mobile app makes everything Inbox instead of asking what label I want, and (2) I'd like for it to tell me what % of my time goes to each segment I've created.",
Very useful app when all features are unlocked. There's a lot to learn in order to achieve maximum utilisation but it's a matter of time.  I would love to experience more active gamification to keep me focused in a fun and obsessive way. This would be an amazing app if it integrated with The Pomodoro Challenge app. Eg. Projects in Todoist could link with Projects in Pomodoro Challenge to keep track of tasks. I can see synergy between both apps.,
This ap help me keep my very scattered non-profit work schedule up to date and very classy. I enjoy the system for keeping track of done tasks as well as all of the tiny little things that make this app. I have no problem paying money for something that will save me time effort and possibly funds in the future. Thank you so much for creating this it has made my work life possible.,
"I've been a To Do-list task junkie since the Palm Pilot days, and I usually switch every few months, but I've been using Todoist now for over two years, and it just keeps getting better and better. I love the new interface design changes, and it functions wonderfully on the Mac, iOS, and of course Android!",
"I have been using AnyDo since it's inception and you guys have managed to drag me (kicking and screaming) over to your app. Love the UI and the features. Now, for the ""be careful"" disclaimer above. If you don't plan on purchasing the premium features of this app, than don't click on the tab for premium. It doesn't take you to an option screen for monthly or how to pay, it just automatically charges you for a full year. So, be careful.",
"You're willing to pay $25 a year to use it, it may satisfy some people, but I need notifications, and paying $25 a year for that is kinda disappointing, if it was free or if you could separately purchase notifications for like $2 a year then I would keep it, unfortunately, I am going to have to look for a different app.",
"I've had the app for a few months but have not taken the proper time to learn it all. From what I have used it's fantastic, I can almost entirely replace my existing calendar with todoist. I like very much that I can sit down and plan a day, which I can do on the side of a box with a pen... what makes todoist special is the reminders, and the flexibility of these. Now I just need ironically an app to motivate me to use it :D",
"Easy to use, largely-intuitive interface, rich functionality but let's me do simple things like quick capture of tasks on the run. I can easily separate out and manage the few tasks I prioritize for today from.the many I throw onto my list, separate out by personal and work (or any category I choose) , and I get a good working interface on all my devices with syncing across all of them. Exactly what I wanted.",
"Both in terms of UX as well as UI this application nails it. Works in perfect sync with the web version and hides away many trivial issues. One slight issue, and i am being really finicky here is the lack of a good drag mechanism while dragging tasks between different dates.",
"I'm using the free version. Meets most of my needs (cross platform synchronisation, intelligent UI when setting dates and times etc). Minor gripe is the relatively expensive monthly subscription - if it is cheaper, I wouldn't mind paying the premium to enjoy the full suite of services. As of now, will stick to the free version.",
I like how the app is set up. The only thing I don't like so much is that there is no option for a monthly subscription to premium. I'd much rather pay that a month at a time. Or if you could use labels in the free version would be even better.,
My phone was recently updated and now will not do any Widget actions. I am able to quick add but I cannot select items to be labeled as completed or reschedule anymore. Please rehash another update to fix this bug.,
"Better alternatives out there.  Astrid clone has all premium features like custom repeating intervals for reoccurring tasks.  I've been using this for over a year and nothing comes close, or if it does it will cost you yearly.  ""Tasks: Astrid To do list clone""",
"Well, just got it 2 days back. Mulitplatform support is amazing. This is an amazing App if you are willing to spend little time on it. For productivity this the tool I was looking for. $30 bucks seems like a lot.l,but hey if this software is enhancing me then money is very well spent, lot of us spent 30 bucks on much more stupid things . Love the innovative way to enter deadlines. My thanks to todoist for amazing product. The self improvement enhancements it does Is well justified the cost.",
"I knew it would not have notifications or comments in the free version, but did not realise that the collaboration, syncing and subs would also be crippled. Wasted 15 minutes, then uninstalled. Much better options out there",
"The app was great even before the update and now it's even more awesome! Only gripe stealing its one star is that the sharing project  feature is somewhat broken since not all tasks are displayed to the users.   Request: enable adding more than one user on a  single task and optionally displaying to the user only the tasks that have been assigned to him (or option to select who can see a task, even when not assigned to them) UPDATE: No gripes with the app, it's great",
"I have been looking for a to do app that not only has excellent functionality and collaboration but also has a really good design. With their selection of apps from web, tablet, chrome, windows and more this is truly the ultimate to do app. Well done. I have just finished transferring all of my any.do list over!!!",
"I've used a multitude of other task managers but finally landed on Todoist for the past couple of years. It's huge amount of cross-platform support is really the big selling feature as well as ease of use, a good amount of features and an easy-to-use interface.   That said, in order to get the best experience (and notifications), you'll need to pay for a premium account. I don't mind paying for it because its so cheap but I know a lot of people are allergic to paying for soft",
"I have ADD and procrastination issues. I've tried dozens of different apps/websites/calendars, and this is by far the best I've ever used. I even pay for Premium, which is not something I usually do! Totally worth it!!! The Todoist staff is also exceptional - great customer service for paying and nonpaying customers alike, and constantly developing great new features.",
"Looks nice and operates fine but this it. What I dislike most is that all todos are bound to dates. And out of the box they all become ""overdue"" unless you take time to set and revise the dates all the time. For this kind of stuff, Google Calendar works much better.",
The syntax for creating tasks is incredibly flexible and easy to pick up.  The included widget also looks very nice.  I pretty much never pay for subscription apps but I am certainly considering going premium with this one after only using it for a week.,
"I've been using Todoist for over a year. Very impressed and satisfied with the pace of updates and regular improvements. They've added batch editing functions previously lacking.  Picking date/time UI is still a bit clunky, but they're getting there. Definitely recommended.",
I am an avid planner! Love my paper planners and decorating them. But I also love to complete what I plan. And Todoist is fantastic! I have the free version which meets all my needs. I haven't found a need to update to premium as yet but have not ruled it out. I like how I can type in exactly what I am thinking and the app 'knows' what I mean and puts my entry's in the appropriate date!! This is great! Todoist is now part of my evening planning routine! Love it!,
"The free version in my opinion deserves 2 stars. The paid version I would love to have and feel that would be worth 5 stars, however; this app does something all its competitors don't... They force you to pay the entire year upfront! 2 bucks a month I won't notice added to my cell phone bill,  but 30 dollars up front out of pocket I will. Looks like Any.do is the winner by decision.",
I plan on using it everyday. I haven't figured out how to schedule an appointment or event months down the road however I have another program for that.,
"(Reply to Todoist: I see the appeal, but computers are terrible at auto-interpreting what people want. Explicit controls are often far less frustrating.) Looking forward to an option to toggle off the feature that parses due dates. e.g. ""Call tires now company"" gets changed to ""Call tires company"". Edits get automatically parsed and unexpectedly change the due date. The good: The hierarchy is neat- breaking projects down into chunks, and nesting those chunks makes them a lot easier to complete.",
I used to be a Franklin Covey paper planner. That is from my generation. I had tried switching to electronic planning before but nothing worked for me until now. I love Todoist! It fits my busy and mobile lifestyle.,
"This app wont blow your mind, but combined with the website on my PC I have total control over my tasks, which is good. It is also becoming more and more intuitive over time.",
"Really enjoying the usefulness in this app. Although there are some paid features that I would love to have, this has been a great free alternative for Outlook tasks, which I needed since my employer switched to google hosted email this year. The chrome extension works well also, and integrated pretty seamlessly with my web based email. It was important to be able to make emails into tasks to save time. The only way I would replace this app is if Google got off it's duff and made their tasks even remotely useful!",
"The app is nice and useful but simple features like notification , deadline and etc don't really need yearly subscription. This features could be unlocked with a one time purchase and cloud features remain in subscription plan for those who really needs cloud features...",
"PROS: Simple and clean, syncs across platforms, so I actually use it. I also use the Chrome plugin on my pc, which can also link to my Gmail to add tasks that are connected with an email. CONS: When you go to enter a new task, it gives a fake example (eg. Schedule meeting with Bob) that can be distracting and make me forget what I was going to add! Seriously, I know how to enter a task guys, please remove the prompts or offer a way to turn then off!",
"I keep track of everything with this. I wish they'd offer a student discount for pro, otherwise I can't justify the expense",
"First app I have used as a to do list that works like I do. Great UI. Easily worth the $ for annual subscription. If  you want something for nothing, write your own app and host your own services on your own servers",
Been using this app for a little over a year now and honestly it's the best Todo list app out. The standard version is nice for starters but I strongly recommend getting the pro. It makes like so much easier and getting things done faster!! Great app 😍🙌,
"We use it at work and track alot of tasks on todoist. It works for me. I'd rate it 5 stars if the pro version was a bit more inexpensive but all in all, great app to have.",
On my laptop a task is shown to be due on Monday but on mobile it says it's Tuesday and all the other tasks are delayed a day. Not exactly sure what's going on.,
"Great tool, HORRIBLE app! How complex can creating a to-do item with reminders be? I can only create items due ""today'. Any other properties need to be added afterwards (or maybe worse: after two months I still couldn't figure it out...). Adn why can't I just create a reminder using a calendar-time selection? Non-Americans aren't accustomed with the American date-time format, so literally typing it is extremely inconvenient. Although I paid for it (hoping the extra features would resolve my issues) I'm looking for something else.",
Will not pay pln 100 per year to have task reminders unlocked.,
"So far the experience has been great on Android, especially compared to IOS.  One key feature missing is the lack of importing txt or CSV from other apps.",
Todoist helped me tremendously by keeping me organized and on top of all of the things I have to do each and every day. It's a great app and keeps getting better all the time.,
Great way to keep track of upcoming tasks and events. A couple of quirks in the free version around recurring tasks. Assume this is not an issue in the paid version. Like it.,
"I really love todist. The karma points actually provides some motivation, but the simple design is really why I love this app.",
Good to have this app. Most of the stuff resembles 'Asana'. I have been using every day and free version. Going good and I am able to be more productive. Removing tasks is been hectic. I was expecting that to be under finger swipe.,
I could not live without this app now.  I record all my todos and projects using Todoist.  I have also linked it to my google calendar so that it automatically create appointments.,
"Works great, and syncs across my devices. Helpful keeping organized, completing tasks, can make quick notes on Android and not lose a thought.",
"The developer is super responsive. It does lack some proactive features, but it's fairly complete.",
This is a great to-do list manager.  I really like that it understands plain English for due dates and recurrence. It would be even better with a Gantt Chart view and easier note viewing.,
I used todoist web for months around 4 years ago then became a mess and left it... I closed my account and I regret it deeply.,
I like the design and the options that it gives me to set calendar dates and times. It is quite expensive to get notifications but I have worked my way around that.,
"I love having it on my browser and as a  app on my phone so the list is always nearby.  Simple , almost too simple, an dj wish it had a few more options but it does the job.",
"Flexible and easy to use.  Great integration across platforms.  Projects, labels and comments make this a great app for personal and work.",
Excellent app. Integrates with desktop and tablets well. Only downsides - things can only be assigned to 1 category and Can't change categories of to-do items easily.,
"The free version is decent, but would prefer the full version. However it is extremely overpriced! You would be very silly to pay that much when so many other apps offer comparible features, at a fraction of the cost.",
"I use todoist on my phone, tablet and at work. Best to do list app I've found, with good, clean looks as well.",
Just love this app. It manages all the chaos in my life in a good way.,
"There should be a link of completed tasks with folders on left links panel... Secondly there should also an option of time management tracker, if I want to track the hours/days spent on specific tasks for future reference or for billing to client. There should also be  an input field for hours/days spent on specific to task on changing the status to completed.",
"boo hiss to those hating on its pricing. Being organized is incredibly important, and having the functionality of todoist over both an app platform and Google chrome extension is incredibly handy! good design and development.",
"It's an excellent app. However, others (such as Wunderlist) provide significantly more features before you hit the paywall.... Whereas with Todoist you can't even use notifications in the free version? Not sure how these calls are being made, but at its base it's a great app and an excellent task-tracking system.",
"This helps in keeping track of everything and motivating myself. I have only used the free version, and it's continued to be useful and helpful both during and post college.",
It is so well organized and useful i love it. Id like the mobile version to look a little more like the pc one but whatever todoist is so cool.,
great syncing between web and app and great categorization feature. Newest version of app doesn't display correct tile on Android,
"Great app to keep yourself accountable. If you think you keep forgetting those important things, use Todoist to be the Superperson who's always on track!",
This app + the outlook plug in works great for me. Only qualm is the widget doesn't refresh.,
"Integration on various platforms, browsers and application (e.g. outlook) has revolutionised my todo lists. Great free, better with subscription.",
Clean interface with the features I want in a to-do list. Handles recurring tasks extremely well.,
I use Todoist every single day to manage tasks and projects. The Android version is very visually appealing by following the material design principles.,
Able to categorize all my to dos and view it either by date or by list/category. I can easily push a task to the next day or to a future date love it,
"Update not working. Even I update tasks in web app, the mobile app is update nothing.",
We use this app as a quick daily reminder of tasks for a 20 person team. It is extremely easy to use and keeps my guys on track all day.,
Coming back from a serious illness I have so many things that need attention it is almost overwhelming. I need a means of helping me break down the tasks into manageable bites. Todoist does it for me!,
"Great app for getting organized.  There is some room for improvement in the ability to easily and smoothly nest tasks together under one overarching task, and I wish selecting projects was a little smoother, but I am very happy with the app for the most part.",
"I am using this app together with desktop application and Outlook add-in. For me it is a good todo list and small project management solution comparing it to more than 7 different products I have used. I believe there are better products but they cost much more. It is a good price for offered functionality, considering also that you can share tasks with your team.",
"I think renovated should be something that should be added. One of the reasons you want a program like this is to remind you to do things. Sorry uninstalling, for what this program do I can use Google keep.",
"I have a lot to balance (school, modeling, photography, and YouTube) and ToDoisy helps keep me on track & let's me prioritize my lists",
This program syncs well with the desktop app that is installed on my office computer and has a nice widget that keeps me in task when I check my phone.,
"Muy buena app para gestionar tareas, simple y útil para lo que se debe usar.",
"Great app, but widget is too bulky and not receiving notifications without premium is a joke. I was actually excited about this app at first, but when I found that out, I knew it just wasn't for me. If you just need to make To-Do lists, not a reminder app, this might be for you",
This is best to do application of all time. I've been using free app for over a year and now I am a premium user and it's totally wort it. All you ever need from to do application is here. Development team is great and app works on all major platforms seamlessly.,
This is a very good app for anyone with bad memory and a lot to do,
"I use this app on my phone, tablet, desktop, and my wife's phone.  We can easily coordinate shopping lists and other to do lists.",
Help me remember things I need to do and get it done.,
The app has been a part if my everyday since the beginning of the year. It helps me keep track of tasks and goals and the recurring reminders make sure nothing is forgotten.,
Excellent app with fantastic customization options. Lets you use it how it suits you best. Great as a free app and worth it for the annual membership if you're looking g for a total productivity solution,
"You will manage your whole life in an easy and effective way,save a lot of time and relax more.you will be surprised !",
My fiance bought the upgrade and it is wonderful. Does everything I could think of to keep me organized,
It must be working because I'm getting stuff done! I'm unsure how to make the projects more prominent though. ..they just kind of hide in the background. I've only been using it for a week though and like the app so far.,
"I loved it, it's user-friendly fast and beautiful. Thanks a lot",
Love this app. It's great for homework assignments. I wish premium features were available for a one time purchase of a premium version of the app. Way too much money to pay a yearly membership fee to get premium features.,
"I used to use Google tasks, but I switched to todoist to be able to share lists. It's perfect for that purpose. EDIT changed to 5 stars as this app gets better and better.",
"Effective, simple, and does keep sync'd across many, many devices keeping me on top of my list everywhere and anywhere.",
I've been using ToDoist as a personal  organizing tool for over a year now. I recently switched to an Android phone and the app is simply stunning. Would recommend anyone to try it for at least a week before going against it.,
Todoist combined with Outlook is a mighty tool for my daily time management. Would love it if I could not only attach emails but also other documents on my desktop for example.,
every damn checklist program needs my fb or g+ account apparently. stupidity at its finest. edit after the answer: do you really think my problem is giving away an account? why should anyone have to register/log in/share anything for -essentially- a checklist program?,
Simple to have a running list of things to do in various projects.,
I've tried several productivity apps but I keep coming back to Todoist.  It just keeps getting better.  Couldn't get through a day without my Todoist and Evernote apps!,
"Excellent app that cleanly organises all my tasks. The free version is great on its own, but upgrade to premium and it synchs with your calendars. I use it across multiple devices (windows laptop, Mac pro, Android phone) and it synchs between them with no issue. Wish I had this years ago.",
"You have to sign up in order to use this app. There are plenty of other apps that do not require this, male it simple guys ... Fail",
"Yes, you have to pay a yearly fee. But this is by far the most comprehensive, easy to use, yet feature packed to do app I've ever used. Is definitely worth the money.",
I am a to-do list junky. And after spending literal years bouncing around. I have settled on the best looking and the one with the best cross platform integration.,
"Works excellently, easy, modern, great on Mobile and great Web interface. I've used a number of ToDo apps over the years, and Todoist is by far the most enjoyable. I've gone premium within a week after playing with the free premium features, which starts 3 days after registering and lasting 30 days.",
"Have been looking for an upgrade to gtask, nothing unwieldy. Todoist works great on all my devices, sharing lists with wife, relationship has improved :) Needs a 12 dollar plan I think.",
"I have been using the app for a month now. I can tell you that it is really easy to input the tasks, track it across multiple devices n multiple platforms. One of the features missing in the free version is ""notifications"".",
"Great revamp of the UI. Used the product previously and was a little disappointed, but it's grown up considerably and I'm really enjoying working with it now. Well done!",
I love the tool but HATE that the logo is so big that it takes up half the screen when using the Windows or browser view.,
Makes sharing tasks at work and home so easy. Free version works great paid version is even better.,
Have to make an account with them. So sick of software that is so self important they think it's necessary to have unique login.,
Sexcellence: sexiness and excellence. Google couldn't have made it better.,
Awesome material design and powerful productivity features make this app my go-to to-do list app.,
"Nice functionality all in all, cross platform support works great. New design and functionality makes this the best.",
Best list managing app on the market. Worth the $25 yearly membership for the full unlocked version.,
"Well, i'm trying to win a girl, so I made a diary to-do list. The thing is, this app simply doesn't have a ""routine"" option: You can't assign a Task for everyday, only for a week; and, if you do, it'd be very helpful if I could set a sample routine for specific days of the year, and add tasks for a single day.",
I think this really helps to keep track of busy workloads and its easy to use. Installed on an android and been using with no trouble for a few days now,
I like how it syncs online and will remind me of things to do. It lost a star because it can be difficult to set tasks as done and modify existing ones,
"Good, but sometimes a little frustrating - is there a way to select the project you want to put a task in, from the add bar? (in the same way you can add a date and time by typing 'tuesday at 11am' etc)",
I like being able to connect with the wife so we can both set things,
Very well designed and easy to use. You can customize your to do list in various ways.,
Searched and tried many paid apps and services. I am premiun user for two months and didn'f find anything to add (but will suggest if I find something in the future). Keep up the god work!!!,
"As long as you enter it, todoist will remember it. I love the email integration. Its definitely made my work flow better. The email client I'm using does have tasks but not like todoist! Enjoy!",
I love this app. I have been able to stay more organized and manage my time so much better,
I have used so many apps .. But this is the best ever productive app.  It reminds me of all works in time,
"If I could set the android widget to automatically sort by date, this would get 5 stars for sure.",
"I recommend since this it's only a to-do list, giving it full functionality with ads so people can try it before the spend almost 2.50 per month for an app that is only appears mildly superior to Google calendar...",
This app is good for multiple platforms but keeping your tasks in check at just one place.,
Love the reminders and the ability to set days. But can't use all the functions without paying.,
"Even without all features, it is helpful",
"With the improvement of subscription model, I find I'm really enjoying this app. Thank you.",
Best to-do list app on the play store. Filled with powerful features. Clean UI and generally well designed. BUT! £18 per year is too steep. Would much rather pay £5 or so for a premium app and be done with it.,
But.. the price is heavy..  I hope you add an option for monthly payment...,
"While there are so.e features that I would like to have, overall I'm really happy with this",
"Love the timed reminders, color coding, karma points. Works with my employer's Google Apps account.  Still trying to decide if it's worth $30 a year.",
"So powerfull and so simple, that I uninstalled all my previous daily task list apps. keep it up !!",
"Clean, helpful, intuitive and packed with features. I especially appreciate the simplicity of having the internet browser  ""button"". Quick and easy.",
I get lots of more things done. Thanks.,
This app plus outlook is my solution right now,
Keeps me organized! It could be even more awesome if it had alarms/reminders!,
"This has, by far, increased productivity in my office and has allowed my colleagues and I to collaborate on tasks using ""projects"" while using the free version. We use this every day and it works seamlessly. I'd give it 6 stars if the option existed! It's VERY important that I note an uncanny parallel between those individuals who gave lesser star reviews(see below) and their competency because this app works.",
Great app for time management,
"Simple and useful, great for manage simple task projects with other people.",
It's all I ever needed. Though it's a bummer that's it's almost 100PLN per year for premium :/,
"Daily notifications, linking to PC effortlessly. I'm loving the app!",
I use it across multiple platforms to keep track of pretty much every part of my life. Brilliant.,
Awesome very well integrated app. Ready for prime time!,
Great app for a service that is probably the most important and valuable I've ever used.,
"Things to do,  ++++. Go see for yourself",
Thank you and keep up the great work!!,
"Super fast, intuitive date input, available everywhere. It just works, loved it.",
Todoist is one of my favorite GTD apps. Thanks a lot and keep up the great work.,
Has already become a key tool in my personal organisation. Thanks!,
"Missing is the reminder , as it is premium feature only compared to any.do which is free",
My existence makes sense because of this app. Great productivity tool!,
I've actually never loved an app so much,
But i didn't  know how to use it,
I find this app helpful and use it often.,
Nicely designed app. Although it requires a monthly subscription to fully unlock all features,
Good for GTD,
Was recommended via a blog about time management. I absolutely love this app!,
easy to use and able to sync across my laptop and phone.,
You have to pay a subscription for reminder functionality. Lol,
I have tried many to to-do list programs...this one is the best!,
"Well designed, awesome integration with Google stuff.",
"So far it's been very useful, especially the daily email.",
The best to-do app available for serious personal use,
Works across all platforms and keeps me organized.,
Pretty good at helping you organize your tasks and integrating with Outlook.,
I really like it but it needs to be easier to navigate and better directions on how to get the most out of it.,
Feature rich and good integration with other apps.,
Works well. Its very good organizing your schedule,
"Excellent app. Tried a few and this is best, easy to use, intuitive, like the karma idea, it motivates me, compatible across platforms...Will probably upgrade in the future...",
Great app that makes it easy to be productive. Easy interface.,
Apps available for different platforms makes it a killer product.,
"Great app, works as advertised",
When a task is completed you cant view it any more,
Not too expensive like I thought due to SMS reminder,
This app really helps me organize my life,
Awesome app keep one organized.,
Really triggered me to write stuff down with the clever karma system,
"Nice, but I am still not dependent on it.",
It's not perfect but it is user friendly,
"Like it and easy to use. Please work on ""Next Action"" functions.",
"But even for reminder of task, it asks for upgrade.",
I'm keeping it it looks good with Google Desk Top Advise(able) 📲 📲 🎆,
"Love this app, superb designing, it truly productive.",
"I use it, and it works.",
"Flexible, well designed and effective.",
List of things to do,
Love the convenience of putting on you daily work.,
Yes..its a good app to list your task,
The reminder service across devices is a rich feature!,
Very intuitive and easy to use app!,
Simply and plentiful features to make my life easier,
"Great,  it's helping me stay on track",
It works for me  lads.,
Its easy and intuitive.,
It really works for those who love list.,
One place to keep everything organized. ..love the list sharing...love the ability to assign a task and share comments...latest aesthetic update is great too.,
"Checklists, documents, reminders, calendar, links -  I use it for everything.",
The super simple yet so powerful app makes it the best ever tool for a wide range of users from the novice to the project managers who work team projects on todoist,
I live it,
Big help with my many projects,
Great app for organizing your thoughts and tasks,
And on time.,
And that's high praise :),
Best to do list I've ever used,
It's the best!,
Really like.  Easy to use. A1,
Great app. Exactly what I needed.,
I want a reminder but don't want to pay $28 for it,
Night and day,
Gets the job done very well,
Helping me getting oeganized,
Really helps cross functional projects.,
"This is how I organise my life - being able to have it in phone, in Outlook & GMail... Best to-do app.",
Easy to use and steady deliver.,
Very good for follow up and tracking,
Great organizer across Google platform,
Easy as expected,
Gets my task done,
I am really liking it,
Keeps order in daily life,
The perfect blend of simplicity and functionality.,
Simple and easy to use it.,
"So far, seems to do what it says",
Easy to manage.,
Sexy app for sexy people ;),
Excellent!,
Connects with Chrome... i love this app.,
Google keep's much better than this membership crap........,
Everything is done right here!,
And it is! Thx,
"Easy to use, like it 👍👍",
It keeps me on track with my day to day errands.,
Good.,
Awesome app!,
... for people who want to be organized.,
Love the layout and styles!!!!!!,
"I am hoping to like. Will buy if I like so , thank you for a 6 month trial.",
Love this app.,
Good app loved it 👌,
Constant sync issues,
Perfect for me!,
Fantastic tool to organise yourself,
Flawless app,
Works as designed.,
Great app.,
Quite tricky,
"A ""To Do"" app like no other... Specially I like the notifications part. Maybe adding notifications by geographical queues?",
Google keep is better,
Best to do apps,
Best app for productivity,
Works for me,
Works good,
تطبيق ممتاز ومفيد,
Use it every day,

高機能なのに、使っているとシンプルに使えます。使い勝手に関する部分が良く練られているとおもいます。,
Will try,
"Anotó las tareas de la facultad aquí, así que hasta ahora no he tenido problema y me ha dado más de lo que espero punto 5 estrellas bien ganadas",
Wow,
Deleted,
"Довольно быстро привык к новому интерфейсу! По началу подумал, что снизилось удобство при добавлении задач,: сначала добавь, а потом только редактируй.. Затем понял, что по долгому тапу на иконке ""+"", задача добавляется так же как в предыдущем дизайне. Появились мелкие глюки с цветами проектов,  в целом прога отличная, а разработчик не дает закостенеть разуму пользователей, благодаря изменениям интерфейса))",
"A clean, consistent and cross platform interface takes Todoist far, and the latest release adds long overdue smarts to task parsing. Sadly, the widget is still oversized to the point of near-uselessness. Pros: sub-tasks and sub-projects, priority levels, tags/contexts, multiple reminders based on time or location, flexible due dates. Cons: No weighted lists, lame syntax for search, filtering and markup, mediocre batch editing and task moving.",
"Great app for many reasons, but it is extremely annoying that I can't easily create new list items by just pushing enter, or some other button. When making things like a grocery list, one needs to be able to quickly add new items one after the other without having to do more than one step. That seems like it should be the most basic feature of an app like this. Would like to be able to do the same with voice commands as well.",
"I agree with the others with having event modifiers just below the listed task and not at the bottom, or maybe just a ticker at the left side for a quick checking of completed tasks. Batch transfer of tasks between projects would also be helpful. Still a great app though",
Once again a company obsessed with updates changes a perfectly good app and screws with it. Nice one on the Internet interface.  Used to be good now not really.,
I just want a To-do list. I'm finding I can get organized with the free version but I liked it enough to pay for a year. We'll see if i can get it to stick.,
"The app does exactly what I need it to do. The free version is still very useful, not one of those apps that is useless unless you upgrade. 10/10 would recommend.",
"It could be a bit more intuitive, sometines it's hard to use it to its max potential.",
"I'm using the free version but it's comprehensive enough to manage my projects in business and personal life. Especially love the scheduling & recurring functionality,",
It's a great tool since my phone is always on me. To jot down everything that needs to get accomplished,
Premium required just to read my own comments that I wrote. Subscription fee rather than one time payment. Totally not worth it. Going back to Evernote.,
In general it's awesome. I give it 4 stars because I would like to have more options to configure the widget. Specially the font size of everything. It is way to big for me and I would prefer to decrease size of elements to fit more information.   Add that and I will give it 5 stars,
Very good app. Keeps me organised with things to be handed in . Also easy to use as it is user friendly,
Since the update I know longer have the quick add feature because of this I rate the app a 2.. The app is beautiful however certain features is missing!,
"Helpful, which is truly saying something. Helps to remind you to get it done! :)",
It's not allowing me to setup extra reminders for tasks.,
I like the way I can use it across devices,
"Fantastic, simplicity at its best.",
Great for to go tasks.,
Widget for a dolist app make a different.,
Awesome...  I've used them all for GTD but this is my fav,
Improve your life.,
Wisely...,
"Simple, Powerful, Everywhere",
Just love it,
Google notes is better,
Hits most of the spots for me,
"I've used just about every task management app you can think of, from asana to wunderlist. After trying to many of them out, I came back to Todoist and I'm very happy with the product, so much that I signed up for premium within the first week of using it again. UPDATE: 10/14/15 still love the app, I use it everyday and it's become and essential tool of mine to get things done.",
"Come on, guys. Setting a time reminder for a task is a basic feature, not a premium one. The free version is ridiculous. I don't care how good it looks, it's not worth it. And paying for the premium version would be silly, since Google Keep offers the same features for free. I can do without tagging my tasks, integrating to Google calendar (although I'd very much like to), but not reminders - a basic feature of any note taking app.",
UI is gorgeous and it displays tasks from different projects on your today page effortlessly. It also syncs flawlessly to desktop. Only complaint of the free version is the lack of a feature like any.do's Plan Your Day or any sort of a reminders feature. Would also appreciate categorizing by due dates (like the priority of a task should increase automatically as it approaches a firm due date). I don't like how idea of due dates is combined with items that aren't necessarily due but you want to do today.,
"Todoist offers full-blown task manager (labels, projects, priorities) with nice (customizable) UI. Date typing and powerfull reminders make app the best productivity tool I use.  There is also Karma - app's feedback which gives you points for working with task. Great way to motivate if that's your kind of thing.  For non-premium users there is a big drawback - Reminders are Premium only.  Premium pricrtag seemed high at first, but it's equal to two beers in Czech republic per month which is great ratio :)",
"Been using Todoist for a while now.  Many rave reviews; it made a believer out of me.  No more notebooks and papers and sticky notes everywhere, disorganized and scattershot.  Clean, configurable, complete control over projects and tasks plus integration with Gmail.",
"I have tried just about every to do list app out there, and this is the closest to perfect that I have found. I have been a paid user for about 9 months now, and for the most part the app has been great. The location based reminders still are not as good as Google Keep though.  The last couple of updates gave me fits when the shorthand for due dates and reminders stopped working properly though.  All in all the app is great, but please fix the bugs!",
The activity onces completed its difficult to figure out what it was. At one place they should mention all the activities that r completed. Also it shall allow to amend whats is written in the task earlier.,
"I love the service as a whole and the Android app in particular. Gorgeous material design, powerful features such as location-based- and recurring reminders. I'd recommend the app and the premium service any day of the week - and thanks to Todoist, I'll be sure to remember to do so.",
"I've tried several to-do list apps (Keep, Wunderlist, Any.do, my own spreadsheets...) and this is by far my favorite. I love the flexibility of recurring dates: every Friday, every other Friday, 5 days after the latest completion, every other month on the 14th at 2:00pm starting in February... I also love the way the app syncs with the web version I access from my laptop. Haven't tried the sharing capabilities yet, but I'm looking forward to it working as well as everything else.",
"The new material update is great, but as others have mentioned the widget is actually the easiest way to add new tasks now, since the main app is a bit challenging and not very intuitive. Otherwise it's a highly recommended app from me!",
"I rarely take the time to rate an app, but this is critical information to the developers. In the last update, the quick add feature disappeared from the pull-down menu on Android. I'm highly disappointed. Was considering moving from the free version to the paid version before this happened, but I can see that even those that have paid for the app have lost this feature. TODOIST, it's IMPORTANT! Otherwise, I really love this application...if only it could do the work for me, then I'd really be overjoyed. ;-)",
"Love this for the most part! Very useful and keeps me organized. I use Sunrise calendar. I would like to use Google Calendar but unsure if this app will  sync and put my tasks on the CALENDAR. ********** 10/16/2015 Very impressed!  The Google Play Developer Console Team responded to my concerns with instructions on how to add ical url to Google calendar.  Works like a dream.  Will highly recommend to everyone I know!  Whoever the Google Play Developer Console Team is ...""You Rock!""",
"The newly updated app's notification does not function properly. Someone invited to share project is not notified within the app, but though email.  Upon confirmation of joining the shared project, app notifies shared project is not to be found. Please help make upgrade on this app accordingly. Also, the new interface is great. The way how it manages projects is clumsy.",
"I use this app on several different platforms and devices and it doesn't seem to sync correctly.  There'll be tasks marked as completed that some sync, some don't. I love this app but the syncing problem makes it much less useful. I will have to switch to do apps if this doesn't get fixed. Thank you for the app ! It has not always had these problems! ***Update 10/19/15: works great! No syncing problems! Syncs immediately.",
"Just enough complexity to organize my projects and subprojects. Interaction with gmail is awesome!!! The free version is fantastic - the only thing missing is reminders, which are a premium feature. I'm too disorganized to remember to do things at a certain time otherwise. I have been using it for a few weeks and already rely on it so much that I am happily going to upgrade to premium. I'm in med school and always busy and I feel like it's a bargain for organizing my hectic life!",
"So intuitive: you can type any date/time terms in words and they will be assimilated, drag & drop tasks and folders, color things, enter search terms. Interface purposefully similar to many email platforms. It can be as simple or as complicated as you make it. Only extra thing I'd personally like that it can't yet do is to be able to search for partial label names, but really that's small fry",
"I am sure the App is Great I was using it for a couple days but then I went to add a comment and saw the premium. I said well I don't really need the comments so whatever, then tried to add a reminder and got the premium popup ... -_- Fine I like the app... let's upgrade... ...28.99 for one year... No.. no no no I am not paying that much for a app that I just needed for reminders ... I would have payed up to 2 99 for it to unlock the reminders, comments and labels ... I wouldn't be using the uploading.",
"Many of us use this now internally, proven to be a great app for managing todos and keeping up with others.",
"I like the UI and I see that it has some really useful features for those who pay. However, it's shocking how I need to be a premium member for reminders - it's one of the simplest features and it's petty how we aren't given it for free.",
This app has completely revolutionized the way I organise my life. It's easy to use and intelligently designed.,
My complaint is mostly about the Web version. Some things can be done on the mobile app but not on the Web version.  It's confusing,
I use the paid version with my co worker.  It is wonderful for what we do.  Having it on all my devices is great too.  Love the comment feature.,
I don't have much specific needs arrangeing my affairs so for me it's perfect. I don't even utilize all the options given.,
Really good app a loved for long time in new cool design. Only thing I can say is that for me is premium useless.,
This is one of the best apps to help keep me productive. Keep up the great work!,
"Works exactly as advertised. Simple to use. I love that the people whp made this have made a free edition which doesn't scunge you, and the paid edition is so affordable!",
I use this on both my android and Windows phones.  I like the syncing capabilities across devices.  On Windows phones the tags are available on the free account.  I just wish that it can be free also on Android devices.,
This app has helped my focus.   Instead of hunting down my many paper to do lists I can easily pull this up on my phone.   I only wish more features were available on the free version.,
I am looking forward to using this in the long term. I won't be parting with this tool anytime soon.,
"Clean interface and useful function. But the reminder function was reserved for a premium feature, I think it did not make sense.",
I needed something to handle repeating reminders without cluttering up my calendar. This is perfect! And love that it syncs between my desktop and phone.,
"Use it to store even my notes, lists n manuals. Jus wish it has a calendar like google calendar n that i can see all my appmts n things to do, then it wud b perfect!",
"Simple integration to Gmail and all my mobile devices. I manage a team of six in Australia from Europe, this has worked brilliantly for me. Highly recommended",
I tried out quite a few to-do list apps before this. None of them can touch it. Good stuff.,
Helped to merge my business and private mail boxes into one to-do list. The app in a phone makes the lust ever present and effective.,
Excellent app that does the job of a couple of apps I had prior. Very easy to use and chock full of handy features.,
A to do app on mobile without mobile reminders is preety useless. Also start selling features unit wise and not all in a monthly bundled pricing as for Indians its a pretty steep premium price for an year i.e. Almost 2000,
"At least from Google tasks, where I have many many lists. Also needs more direct integration with Evernote. I'm still comparing with Trello and IQTell.",
Update version looks ok but still need to pay for reminders.  The demo said it was free in the new update.   Please correct this.  Meanwhile im sticking with Google keep.  Its reminders are free,
"It would be nice if inbox can be arranged in different ways, such as ascending and descending according to dates, and in alphabetical order.",
If the premium is a one time purchase then it makes sence. But I don't think the premium options are worth a monthly subscription....,
"Just wish I could have more than one list to separate school, work and personal things.",
"Intuitive, simple, and works well. Integration with my desktop is helpful. Favorite feature is being able to type due dates and times, that's what made me choose this task app",
"The mobile app is maybe a little bit more solid than the Outlook plugin, but is a terrific application in general",
"To implement GTD I needed an @in folder for anything that didn't have a context (which I do with labels) or a project, I managed to do that with a filter: ""no label & p:inbox"". After that my setup was complete!",
Best features are paid. -3 Stars. All the features I was looking for come in the paid only version only. -2 Stars (If I could) Try any.do or the Google todolist for a better experience. Not to mention free.,
What's the use of a to-do app without alarm functionality. Why pay to get such a basic feature.,
This app keeps track of my todos and notifies me when items are due and tracks how many days.over due. Very user friendly,
I really like this app. Works well with gmail. Allows me to be reminded of tasks via email. I would only suggest adding an option to sync to calendar than it being automatic if i write a task with the words fRIDAY or something like tha. I look forward to other additions and tweaks,
"I moved all my tasks from another to do app and I don't regret it. Excellent task manager,recommend.",
"The app is great. The widget sucks, IMHO. The smallest setting is too wide, it could be more compact.",
Also would like to use for grocery shopping but don't see an easy way to create a list. Keep has the look I like. Todoist has the reminders I like.,
"This app doesn't let you do what most other ""to do"" apps allow you to do for free. Need a premium account for most features. Daily emails that require you to enter your password when unsubscribing. Not for me....",
Use this everyday. Make a to do list to get done throughout the week and it reminds me daily of what needs to doing. Great for project management. I would like to make a list on the app and be able to mark off single items such as a shopping list. But overall it's great.,
"Using Todoist has greatly improved my efficiency and turnaround time with my personal and professional life. It's quick, easy and fun to use!",
This is exactly what I have been looking for. Simple powerful encompassing my personal and business to do lists. I am getting so organised!!! Love it.,
"I have this on my phone, laptop and pc in the office and it all syncs up really well and the email reminder keeps me straight. I liked Trello too but I like how we can put a date on these tasks.",
"The widget has a huge empty spaces on screen. So for me the question is why I have Note 3 and able to see 5 or 6 tasks per screen? Still unhappy with this ""material"" things.",
"Not just a list like all the others, an efficient tool for organizing and prioritizing that works on all my devices!",
"This is one of the better task management apps, however, it is sorely lacking the ability to filter and search on complete tasks.",
Good all around,
"A solid app which does most of what I want. My only objection is that a few of the paid upgrade components are available free in Google Tasks. Still, probably worth the upgrade cost.",
"Todoist does everything I need, but has such a clean interface that it feels like a very simple app. It keeps getting better with each new version!",
"This app has just the right feature set -- enough to get things done, but not enough to overwhelm the user and clutter the look.",
"When I email the team a question,  the response time is lightning fast and I mean within 2 minutes. They really take care of their customers. GREAT tech support along with a nice product. With the addition of a modern, easy to use and gorgeous interface like Any.Do this app could really be nice. Their support is second to none with no other developers coming even close.",
Waste app,
"A little confusing at first but once you play with it for a while, it is great.",
"Helps me stay on track, for just the free version it does the job plain and simple. No complaints.",
Finally an easy way to keep a to do list that nags me so I don't forget I have a to-do list,
"It would be nice if the color-coded circles were bigger or the entire task was colored because right now it's nearly unnoticeable, but the app itself is useful.",
"This app is great. Does exactly what you want, with nice desplace. Is annoying in the fact it emails you every day with your 'to do digest' and has this weird karma thing that judges you for not doing things!",
"I use todoist every single freaking day multiple times a day. I run three businesses and every task I have to perform for these businesses runs through todoist. I'm hopelessly addicted, thank you for creating this!",
"Nice organization. The more I use it, the more I like it. Best of all, the complete and immediate sync between phone, tablet and desktop. Awesome.",
Wish they had a monthly premium subscription instead of a yearly one. Otherwise love the app,
I hate when apps send me notifications and even emails all the time.,
"I like the simplicity and flexibility of the app and the preset lists that make it fun and easy organize, but they need to make a WIDGET(!!!!!) for Android users! I LOVE widgets and if there's no good widgets for the app, I'd always rather pick an app with a widget, no matter how good your app is.",
Thank you,
"I would prefer a more simple, straightforward arrangement, but a very good app nonetheless",
"Lots of integration into my digital life. Bonus for a simple, functional, easy to understand interface.",
Been using if for a few days. It is wonderful. I'll be reviewing it agaian with some more use.,
Very clear and clean template to us. Its efficient and i like it alot,
If you are an ADD guy who needs a checklist that crosses over multiple devices then this is what you are looking for.,
Far too many of the features are locked to use the app properly. And why can we not deactivate our account?,
5 stars if it stops nagging me about the premium version,
This app does exactly what is needed with a minimum of fuss. It would be perfect if labels could be shared across team member profiles,
This app is exactly what a busy person needs. Its fast and simple and the widget is a life saver,
I feel so much more organized now! Thanks! And when you check off a task I love the little 'reward' comment :),
Tidy and luce changing. Plan your life in a easy way with just a few taps,
Really great app...have been using it daily on computer and phone,
"It will better, if it should assign more than 1 people",
"Can compile a large to do list of small chores and errands or goals and organize them quickly. Widget is nice as well. Has a cool feature that let's you type ""someday"" as a due date and it picks a random nearby date for the chosen task. Some suggestions: Would love a faster way to organize inbox into different projects, currently takes a few button presses. Also, syncing with the Google calendar. I guess I'll just download one that it does sync with.",
pragmatical. simple. user friendly. optimum for someone that wants to get stuff done.,
The fact that the app has the option to work as add-on to outlook is just perfect for use. Saves a lot of time !!!,
reliable app that never fails to remind you your tasks,
Love the interface and it's very detailed and organized.,
"Tried out different apps for Todo purpose. Kept coming back to this app for scheduling. Best in the market for planning your life. Good job. (Y ""Kept coming back"" in the first place?: the widget could do better for people having dark background.)",
If you are someone who likes using task management applications - this is the one to have!,
"Is there any way to reduce white space on android widget? I wish to see more task at once. I also wish that tasks with deadline also appear in my calendar, do you have plans to make calendar (monthly) view? Or pursue tighter integration with the like of google calendar?",
"Exactly the way i do my work! Love the,supportive messages too!",
"good GTD app, so nice to use, great real time support",
"Sticker shock for premium app. The features that are unlocked would make this app 5-stars, but it's not worth $30/year.",
"Really nice, streamlined design.",
Why do you need a stupid account for everything I mean its a to do list why do you need a f.....g account deleting this now! Not happy! 😈,
I love todoist. I really do. It suits my needs perfectly,
Finally an app that does what all the others promise to do. Its simple but highly effective.,
"I've downloaded so many of these types of to do lists...so far,  this head impressed me the most,  so far. .... I'll get back to you. ..if that changes.",
"simple, intuitive, good for keeping organized and productive. highly recommended.",
Would prefer if widget was more functional. Otherwise pretty good,
"Does everything you would want it to do, and intuitively",
It does what it promises and even more than I expected.,
Let's get things done in neat fashion.,
"After trying out many, many other apps, I've finally found the one I've been looking for. Great app.",
Great! Application for managing tasks and the karma points motivates u more!,
Very useful. Multi platform support works really well.,
Powerful and easy to use for projects and schedules. Labels and some features only in paid version.,
I tried a lot of app. Todoist is the easiest to manage with a clear interface.,
But almost all features are available in android calander and keep,
Love this app for on the go notes that need reminders later!,
It keeps me orgenized and never miss a thing and the cool designe too ♥,
If only it is cheaper! For students.,
I have been using it as my GTD app and I am pleased,
Good but won't let me add new tasks,
Everything in one place but access  it from every place. No more paper lists yay!,
It does what I need a long as I remember to use it.,
Only started using this App but just Loving it,
Best comprehensive tasks manager with genuine cross platform support,
The best to do list app ever but i wish they include desktop features in mobile version,
It's the Most productive app yet!,
veeery not compact widget :(,
"Цікавий застосунок. Тільки в безкоштовному варіанті він неюзабельний - теги і нотатки доступні лише в преміум версії. За 10хв використання і перегляду відео-роликів прийшов до висковку, що swipes взяли за основу ту саму коцепцію, що й цей сервіс, тільки оптимізували його під сенсорні екрани і зробили інтуітивно зрозумілий інтерфейс + інтеграцію з Evernote, який для спільної роботи більше підходить, ніж туду-лист + існує ж  trello  Хоча для чіткої структуризації і пріорітезації todoist у преміум варіанті, безперечно краще підходить. І функціонал додавання повторення події в них вельми потужний",
Love it very helpful for very busy n fullday working schedule people,
I think is the best list to do app,
Great business tool and force multiplier!,
Keeps me accountable to my list..great app,
Cannot do without todoist anymore.,
Worth the money to go premium. Its an organizational game changer.,
Ok but no back up / restore,
Helps to deal with anarchy,
Worth each penny!,
Recommend to the all do-ers,
Add more options since I pay 30 dollars a year I like this app better than keep add more useful options add sunrise calendar sync integration not just for icalendar for Apple users,
Required bit more improvement,
The best task management out there,
The widget is really useful thanks,
It's just wonderful!,
Love it and what it does.,
Excellent product. Like syncing with other devices.,
Just for reminders.  F**k off,
Simple and does it all,
Great Integration Across All Platform,
The best app of its kind,
Awesome natural language task app,
Good choice for following our project.,
"I use it everywhere; thunderbird, chrome, Android...",

"Excelente aplicación para mantenerte al día en tu trabajo y/o proyectos. Por lo menos la opción de compartir fotos debería estar disponible en la versión free, con un límite de espacio para las mismas, y luego de culminar la tarea estas se eliminen, que sólo se conserven si eres premium.",
Todoist instantly became my task manager after checking it out when I read about the rebranding. I noticed it was offered on pretty much any device you would need. The app itself is easy to use and navigation is smart. The one thing I think could be improved is using the back button on Android phone to go back to the last screen you were on.,
"Since July, updates have made entering tasks with dates, numbers, and projects harder. It is terrible enough that we've been allowed, eventually, to turn off this ""intelligent quick add"" filth on the website, but this app still does the thing even if you turn off the feature.  As such, the app is basically unusably broken. I have gone back to paper and I'm now uninstalling.",
"I'm a big fan of the GTD methodology, and I've tried many apps to support it. For the way I use GTD, this app fits me like a glove. Everything I need is there, I don't feel like I have to shoe horn things to make them work, and it's not overly complicated. It fits a wide range of devices and synchronizes between them quickly and effectively. I especially like the email client plug ins. Powerful stuff.",
I organize my days around all my tasks and appointments -  even reminding me I have to play a little every day. I've tried Outlook task manager and others but found nothing that gives me the flexibility and features provided by ToDoist. I'd like to see a few enhancements to make projects easier to manage - like task dependencies and better completion review. I'm hoping we'll see those in future releases.,
"But, there's some difficulties creating sub tasks, and it would be nice if the remember option wasn't premium, because I think it's needed some kind of alarm. Also, when you edit a task, maybe it's better to do A/B testing and simplify some options, like setting the time or/and day, it has more than 3 different ways of doing it, so, less options for a same task it's better.",
"So loving todoist, so simple yet not short of great functionality! As an ex omni focus (task list king, Mac & Apple only) user I have felt no real loss since joining the todoist ranks & feel totally pumped as I punch through my tasks & receive my reward points.",
"Smart, simple, intuitive. The worst part about other task management tools I've tried in the past is they really seem to go out of their way to overcomplicate an otherwise simple need. This one doesn't. Love the UI and the service. I went pro a week or two after trying Todoist for the first time and see many happy and productive years ahead.",
"It works really well, it is very Google like with material design. Smooth and intuitive (although lacking tutorial) It's pretty limited without a subscription but still usable. It would be nice to have reminders in the free version. It syncs with the chrome app, so you can check your list anywhere - very nice.",
"When I finish a repeating task (which this app does) and ""check it off"" it does not show back up on my list of things today until the day it needs to be done. What a wonderful feeling to see a list  get smaller instead of  staying the same size. Even over due repeating tasks leave when checked off and are not created as yet another overdue task. This is how my paper planning works and it is wonderful  to find an app that works like it. I also love having it on all my devices.",
"Very inefficient in screen space and it requires more taps to get things done. I've been using it for a while now and haven't gotten to like it. I'd pay money, more than the current premium fee [which I do now] to have the old interface from you or your competitors.",
"I have been using this on my phone, no other interface so I haven't had any issues in that regard, but it's a good little app for helping me manage my huge list of ""things that must get done"" from all my craft WIP to family appointments and just general everyday things, I can use one app for shopping lists and project lists and house lists, it's nice. I am still getting used to everything being in one place and having to go and check things off, but so far it is helping me get much better organized.",
"My only complaint is in regards to the comment function for tasks. It seems sort of silly that the second someone begins to type a note, they're no longer able to add attachments to that comment. It's also somewhat of a bummer that the extent at which someone can modify a comment is solely limited to changing the text, or deleting the comment all together. I was surprised that it's apparently impossible  right now to reposition a comment up/down the list. I can envision moreorganizationalfeaturesinthefuture",
"I have only updated the app because I have been forced to do so since the widget did not sync with the browser. I find that this was completely unnecessary and so far my experience with the app is much worse, which leads me to start considering other apps despite being having a premium todoist account.",
"I love the uncluttered design of todoist.  First when I started using it couple of years back, I couldn't adapt the idea of minimalist design which todoist brought. I was using wunderlist that time. But slowly when I got used to todoist. I didn't look back. Even the free version provides me so much productivity that It really tempts me to go for the premium version. What holds me back is the reporting functionality. Have I not looked it up properly or todoist still don't offer extended reporting?",
"You'll like this app if you love minimalist design. With premium, organizing and filtering tasks become even more easy. This tool has been an essential part of my daily routine. Highly recommended!",
"This app is just a waste of money and time. You cannot view filtered task on ios platform, when you assign a task the person assigned cannot view the task on android platform. Just complete rubish. Do not sign up for this app. Unless you want to waste valueable time trying to figure out how to carry out a simple task.",
"Great to do list app! Out of all of them I've stayed with this one the longest whcih is saying something for me! I love the clean and minimal design. There's a million hidden shortcuts and features and the whole app is rock solid! Sometimes I wish there was a way to add reminders a little easier(less taps), and I would love a day planning view but this app fits my needs and wants!",
"It is TOO smart sometimes and when I type for example ""do home work one hour per day"" it convers ""one hour"" to 1pm reminder. Also due date and reminder are confusing, looks like it doesn't show tasks with today reminder in the widget (it shows today due dates).",
"Beside that, all of the interesting and helpful features like getting notifications, adding labels... only available on the premium version. So if u're looking for the basic and free to-do list app, it's not worth downloading.",
Only rated it 4 out of 5 as I'm still using & pushing the capabilities of the  free version But both the ease of use & multi-platform availability is leaning me towards unleashing the full potential of the paid premium model... Will amend when & if I commit.,
"This app won't even let you add notes to a task or view completed tasks.  That's basic functionality and should not be considered a premium feature. This app is a free trial, not a full app.            Adding a subtask is a nightmare of confusion, poor formatting, and extra steps. That's as far as I got; if they can't get the fundamentals right, I'm not going to invest time to discover what else they got wrong. And the spam emails? I'm trying to get more organized, not add extra clutter I need to deal with.",
"I've been happily using this app for almost a year -- best to-do system I've ever tried. At the point where if I don't put it in todoist, it probably won't get done. Especially great for scheduling recurring chores and location-based reminders.",
"Just want to try this application. But when you ask me register to continue, then I uninstall this application. Sad to know that this application didn't have demo version that not require user registration. ======== You still didn't hear me at all. I don't want register just to see what is this application can do even if registration process is so quick. If I would like your application then I can register and give you access to my email etc. AnyDo application can work without registration, and if user want more features like sync he can register at any time. You can do the same things: give to users guest mode and save the ability to register for using more features. This is simple and compromise way.",
"I'm sorry but since when was it ever acceptable to charge on a monthly basis for a blooming organisation app? I'm not buying that ""ah you spend so much on a coffee"" nonsense - there are app developers that have worked much harder than you and don't charge like this. This app is basically unuseable unless you get into a contract with the owners wherein you fritter your money away for a very basic tool.",
"I like all the added animation, but first things first, it now takes much more efforts to edit a task. There is just too much useless space and too little information in one page. Please make things compact again",
"I have tried many such applications before sticking to ""todoist"". The ""Karma"" points keeps you stick to your work and push your productivity to next level. In my case i am finishing many works same day, which were generally postponed. Would highly recommend.",
"You can use it however you like, but it's a better format than using just random notes to keep track of your tasks, and it's so simple to use.",
"It is very useful for me to organize my works in school and private things togethet. I usually use this app for sorting out all the works I have to do, and plan it in the order by the priority. This is very powerful tool to schedule all messy works in a neat work schedule.",
"There's some fragmentation to create a subtask. I use this app for my work, and its pretty unintuitive and difficult to add subtasks to a main headline (which should be a common use case.). The flow process to do so involves way too many steps on phone and web interface. Would love to give you more in depth feedback about this app as well as the web based app. I paid for a premium subscription and definitely feel like it's not quite there for the admission price I paid. Thanks guys!",
"I love Todoist service but interface of the app needs improvement. For recurring task, I can't set them up from scheduling button. I can't set up task hierarchy with ease.",
"Where have u been all my life! The perfect app for ppl who manage multiple projects and teams. If u can't manage yourself well, u can't manage your projects and teams well! And you don't have to reinvent the wheel: just download todoist!",
"Poor, poor interface.  Extremely difficult to move tasks around and create sub tasks, both on the desktop and Android app.  When you complete a task with sub tasks the relationship is lost.  Un-completing these tasks and sub tasks creates them all as top level tasks.  Uninstalling.",
Fast and easy with lots of options. Only thing I would like to add is location services so I could link tasks to a location.,
Also the frequent updates and engagement with users is impressive. I cannot help but appreciate it.,
Reminder is basic function for any basic task list apps.Even that feature is premium.i have not faced apps that has basic needs as premium. This kills the real purpose of task list reminder.,
I like the app a lot. But I don't love it. It us not exactly intuitive with how things are organized and it automatically corrects times in the note when I just want to type how much time I am to spend on some task.,
"It's a great app and I have become more organized using it. I use the web app at the office, but like the app to remind me on the go. Love the web app, but the android app could use a little more work. Great job todoist team!",
Not the best if you're looking for a simple to-do app. But great for managing projects.,
One of the two apps I use to coordinate my many work projects and todos.  Still deciding if I should stick to this or Trello.,
"Solid, sharing works well, supports multiple platforms, doesn't lose or delete your lists.",
"Todoist is highly customizable, and I can work it to suit my needs for business, graduate school, and personal tasks. I highly recommend the premium version to unlock its complete potential for what it can do for your life.",
It works for my (perhaps overly enthusiastic) way of detailing and breaking down projects and tasks.,
"A lot of apps are worthless unless you pay for premium. This is not one of them. It works great without upgrading, although I am sure it would be a great advantage to upgrade if you can!",
"An amazing intuitive interface without too much task organization overhead. The biggest plus is that Todoist is reliably in sync everywhere.  An app worthy of 5 stars, a subscription and a Massive Thank You to the developers.",
It is simple and useful. Only the premium upgrade is little expensive and it is annual fee,
I don't like the fact I have to pay for premium to set notifications to remind me to take a medicine or whatever it is I need to do,
"I would love a todoist briefing widget, which would allow me to see and maybe even check off tasks directly from the widget, rather than opening up the app each time. To see my tasks right there every time I look at my home screen would be an awesome mental trigger. Thank you for reading! Love the app, just this one suggestion!",
"I used to like it. Everything - from customer service to the app iteself BUT they made a major release where they not only released a COMPLETELY buggy and unfinished app, but they also insulted those who complained. The app doesn't work and they claim it's a feature. You judge.",
The quick add and reminders save space in my brain to focus on what is at hand.,
I like the app. Pretty awesome. Don't enjoy the emails though,
"I little bit expensive but it's very useful. I like the advance planning feature, you can write something like ""Every Monday,Friday at 10am"" to setup a recurring task.",
Really useful. Clean interface with esential features. This is the best task manager I have seen so far. Elegant.,
"I tried various Task management tools but this is the best.  I can have my task list in my phone, pc, company pc and also my tablet.  Or else I can check via website.  Wonderful.",
Thanks for fixing the bug.   The list that has children tasks don't expand or collapse when tapping on the Chevron. Some refreshing fixes the list.,
"This app is fun, colorful, easy to use, and helpful. Works really well with the standard Android platform with all settings and pulldown tabs exactly where you would expect them, making it easy to do what you want.",
"Great app, would love to see some version of the reminders made available to free users. I'm definitely going to upgrade to a premium account, but, in the meantime, a way to stay on top of my appointments via the app would be great.",
"I love everything about it, the UI/UX the web application and i am really considering upgrading to premium.",
The app seems to do all it says it does. I've had no problems at all. But have not used it much either.,
"I've tried a bunch, and this is by far the best to do type app I've used. Premium is most definitely worth the price.",
"Really love this app. Works across ios and android very nicely. Would probably upgrade if it was a one time fee instead of annual. Also, the upgrade is expensive.",
"Still like and use it, but this version is less functional ( eg when entering new task on phone always defaults to today rather then giving choice of date as previous version did.)",
"This is an excellent app and an excellent system, my only request would be to improve the android wear part of it. This would be nearly perfect if I could mark tasks as finished from my moto 360 and accept requests.",
"I would happily give this app 5 stars if it had the comments option free. Advertisements would be fine by me, but a yearly subscription? Not ready for that kind of commitment.",
The material design thing screwed up the usability aspect. The new red design is just awkward.,
"Only been trying it a few days, and already I'm finding the whole system (web, plug ins and Android app included) to be very beneficial. Very well thought out and nicely designed user interface.",
"I have updated my review to give them five stars! It is my favourite todo app, both mobile and web. They canstantly keep improving ot over the years and still nothing can beat it.",
I use the app every day to manage my to-do list on multiple devices. The updates keep coming bringing useful additions. Overall I am very satisfied.,
"Awesome to-do list. Use it all day every day. I have it on windows, Android, Android wear, outlook and access it in Linux via web portal. Great job guys.",
"Todoist is the best app you could ever find in any platform. That's the service you want, with the cross platform feature life is easy and organized, I'm a strong supporter of such services with great features like cross platform support. Keep it up team. 👍",
"Tried a lot of to do list apps and found this one to be the best. Simple, has categories, and best of all, has built in date functions. 5+ on this one! ( By the way, premium version is not worth the $29. I spent it and don't use any of the features)",
I used to have a notebook with things to do. Now I don't and I can assign work to my team easily.,
No notifications reminders without subscription. Pretty dumb.,
I really like the reminders and the ease of entering in things. Good app for a busy person!,
I have been looking for an app like this for a while now. The simplicity and polish of the app is great.,
Keeps me organized... Great price too if needing full features compared to other apps,
"Very easy to use, simple yet elegant, and Reminds you daily of upcoming events.",
Very easy to use and integrates fairly well with other apps and services.,
Todoist is focus on to do list app. Thats make us not bothered with all other gimmick feature.,
The design is sleek and easy to use. Takes little time and effort to schedule plans. The functionality is great too. Recommended.,
This app has helped me to manage my time and to be so much more productive! I love the Projects feature.,
So far this app is the best one. I'll consider to move to premium.,
Great app. Powerful and still easy to work with. Apps availble for Multiple platforms. Helps me a lot to get my work done.,
Need every single feature to be unlocked in free but with limitations..,
"I wish it had a more detailed history for tasks marked done, like the day they were marked",
Excellent app getting better and more intuitive to use for every update. My favourite todo app on mobile currently :),
Widget wastes A LOT of space.  Need an option to hide days without tasks.,
The best todo app.  Period.  Great for project management or your grocery list.  Awesome Python API.  Awesome support people.,
Todoist is effective for managing personal or business tasks. Sharable task lists are great. I recommend todoist.,
Syncs with my calendar and works well on my Samsung.  Must get the pro account for it to be usefully pleasant.,
"Best app of its kind, though I would like the option for a quicker design instead of flashy.",
Awesome tool for organizing your day. Tried quite a few before settling here. Highly recommended!,
I just would like to see a better notification when a to do item comes up.,
I like how this app organizes the tasks. It is easy for me to focus on them.,
I used to like this app but your recent 'update' is making it virtually impossible to use the app. Every time I write a day or date into the task content the app decides that's the due date and removes it from my task content!!!! I can't see how to stop this happening. Time to stop using this app,
"I've tried all the ""to-do list"" apps and this has been by far the best one. Keep it up!",
Don't know how I managed without it!,
"Great functionality, easy to use, a ""get things done"" app.",
Totally recommend. Great Org tool,
My long time search for an efficient tool ends here :-),
The desktop version is almost flawless .The app is good mainly for on-the-go task management.,
After update widgets are not working,
Simple interface that's consistent across platforms. Lot's of options for tagging and prioritizing tasks.,
I love this app and the functionality is top notch add always... Except for reduced functionality in the last update. Where's the list widget?! Please bring it back! Edit: just kidding looks like it was just a bug during the update! Widget is back!,
Does everything I want. Keeps getting better,
Only rivals can rate it less than 5 stars :D,
So far the best app for ToDos and productivity. Highly recommend!,
"Very good, similar  in operation  to Outlook  tasks.",
It's a nice app. Gets the job done without a big hassle.,
"I really like this, or does what I need so I'm satisfied.",
Just started using it. Seems well organized and easy to use so far.,
Parses my input amazingly well.  One day it will be great for parsing speech as well.,
It's been more helpful than Google Tasks,
Tried the rest.  Now use the best,
Great help to get things done over different devices,
Laste update was pathetic. My phone turned off a number of times....,
"Simple to use, no silly frills.",
was looking for a simple linear project based to do list. this is all i need.,
Best tool for collaboration and personal organization I e used ever!,
A day does not go by that I don't use this app.,
Great way to keep organized and work with your team.,
This app has completely transformed my task and time management. And I've brought a dozen or so coworkers onto it. Where's my commission?!,
"Super clean, efficient and the UI is thought per platform.",
Though I liked the square checkboxes more in the web version! :),
Is the best app for be more productive and have a great design.,
Definitely made my scheduling easier,
Nice with scope of lots of improvement,
Good every day digital notebook with a lot to offer the average Joe,
The most useful productivity tool I have ever seen,
"Todoist is well-designed, helpful, and beautiful. A great app!",
The price is pretty steep though.,
"Great app, does what it says!",
"Awesome, turbo powered to-do list!",
Todoist keeps you on track.,
Easy to create tasks and reminders from the productivity apps i use.,
"Terrific app, great user interface!",
Very useful for structuring your activities..,
"Very flexible, and yet easy to overview all the tasks",
This is the best task app I've found yet. Still using this after 2 years! Great app!,
Keeps me on track and very easy to use!,
But a little quirky in the way it goes about things.,
Not as easy to use as I would like it to be.,
This application can only get better,
Good,
"Easy to use, syncs well across devices and platforms",
Great integrations and interface.,
Needs better tracking ability.,
Best application in the world!,
One of the best productivity apps there is!,
Time management  tool cloud  based,
Like everything expect the color,
Nice app but can b better,
"Couldn't be without it, highly recommended",
This app keeps me sane.,
Turned out to be useful.,
Easy to use and aesthetically pleasing,
Todoist is perfect except it's missing a checklist,
Fits like a glove.,
Refer to title,
It works very well,
Best app for managing your tasks.,
Great app... helps to plan ur day a lot better and makes your life simpler...,
Perfect for keeping track of my homeworks and assignments.,
Finnally a to do app exactly as i needed.....THANK YOU DOTTOTECH for the heads up!!!,
One of the best to do list I've used,
It does what I needed,
"I have to pay $30.00 for the premium to put in an alarm to remind me when I'm supposed to complete my task???! This app hasn't shown me anything worth paying  that much, and you want me to just pay up just to use it??!! I don't think so!!! I can't do anything on this app!!",
Love it help me so much,
Exactly what I needed,
Love the contextual inputs,
Very simple and productive,
Highly efficient. Like it. Syncs hassle-free.,
Type In What YOU want Do and get it done with this awesome app as a companion.!!!!,
Big help for better productivity,
It works exactly as described!,
It makes my work very easy to track .....just loved it,
Excited to see the new Version !,
"Very handy app,  loved it",
Very impressed,
Read title,
Best app I have ever seen,
Best Reminder App,
It is really good app..,
To expensive!,
Do not send (spam) email!,
Is there any way to add progress meter to every task?,
Lots of improvements.,
Awesome App!,
its very useless,
Love the new logo.,
I love it!,
Very good!,
Keep it up. Good job...,
Best organization application!,
Essential for multi-tasking,
I like this app.its just ok...,
Perfect for what I need.,
"Easy, useful & simple",
Great app!,
Awesome!,
Love it!,
Love the app on my phone,
Does what it says and pretty well,
Widgets need more functionality,
Love it!!!,
No adware.,
Awesome  app use this everyday,
Love the language recognition,
Super easy to use,
Well organizer,
Simplicity at its best,
Help full app,
Excellent android app,
Great tool,
Does what us supposed to,
It works as prescribed,
Close to perfect,

Reminder is premium,
"Justamente hace un año 15/09/15 realicé el comentario de que el icono me parecía feo, ahora, un año después, mi deseo ha sido cumplido, y yo sigo firme con mi calificación de 5 estrellas. Me voy feliz, estrenado logo nuevo. Pero bueno no todo es el logo, la aplicación está de 10 y es muy útil.",
Ok,
,
"Great app, and beware of the hidden $30/year subscription fee. You'll be prompted for the Premium upgrade on most screens when you're not expecting it. They will lure you in, as the limitations of the free version will leave you frustrated and wanting more. Aside from that, it's well-made and is much better than Asana. I use it for work projects and personal tasks. Very happy that it syncs with my MacBook and Apple devices too.",
"Making the secondary buttons to things like changing the date of task be so spread out rather than right there under your finger is a very poor design choice. Following what lollipop did badly is not a cool thing. Its the kind of things that make me wonder if the devs even use their apps. Please make your app more streamlined instead of less.. Update:+1star, getting better..",
"Can be simple and can be deep depending on your needs. Apps seldom have a personality, but todoist has one similar to a friend who really wants to help you. Thanks guys,  keep  improving.",
"Every time I jump from somewhere in projects to managing a label, the app crashes. Also, when editing a task, if I set the labels and then add the reminder time, on returning back the labels disappear. Would really need this to be fixed by the team.",
"Use it daily (premium user). Has the right features and an intuitive UI. Cross platform is a saver - use android, outlook and ipad. Only complaint is the cumbersome management of subtasks.",
His app is really slick. I love how you can put all info in one field instead of switching fields to put in due dates and recurrences! Sweet,
So far this app has been able to do everything I ask of it while keeping things simple enough.,
Like everything but wishes it can more choices for time if reminders.  Would be nice so you had an option to put in your reminder period.,
"You won't go wrong with Todoist.  Support is fantastic.  Frequent updates to improve.  It is far better and more reliable than ""Any.do"" and deserving of being called number one.",
I do works that has a similar process and so the same todo list I wish I could repeat an already made one,
"I've tried several different organization apps, but I just keep coming back to todoist. Keep up the good work.",
"It's just too much money when you think about it, you can do much of the things they offer for $30 on so many free apps already,. But I like the new look it rocks .",
"The biggest letdown with this app is that you can't assign tasks to anyone, not even yourself (or its so illogical that you won't know how). Also the newly created tasks are never assigned to you, great maybe in a team setting, but it's extra steps for someone using it for personal use",
I've tried lots of to-do apps and so far this one surpasses then all.  Keep the improvements coming!,
"I like the new logo. The app keep improving and it's updated on a regular basis. I pay for the premium version, and I love the additional features with very prompt support. I've tried many todos apps but I've settled on this one. Please keep up with the good work!",
very convenient. being using it for a long time. a friend suggested me. i think the one of the best :),
Perfect to keep track of everything I need to do.,
It is so fast and easy to manage your tasks with Todoist.,
Its been 30 seconds and they want $28. How about a trial first? No wonder I never heard of this app until today,
The best to do app I've tried.,
But liked the previous logo more,
Bring back the old icon or riot! :),
"Does not synch with Google tasks, fee per year, not worth it for my use.",
Really enjoy the new look!,
Just loved it,
Todoist,
"For me, the only premium feature that I think should be free because of it's absolute basic nature is alerts. I would be happy to purchase premium because I think this platform is awesome but I don't like having to pay for a whole year up front. Nevertheless 4 stars because this is by far the best cross-platform task manager available and trust me, I have tried them all extensively.",
"Great app, easy to use. The paid option is worth it. My only suggestion for a future feature is the option to have a repeating task be repeated on a set schedule or from the date when the task was last completed. That way, if I'm a few days late in completing a biweekly task, the schedule adjusts automatically so the next due date is two weeks from when I actually completed the task.",
"I paid for premium mostly because of this functionality - location based reminders. And it is very basic, lack of simple features and almost unusable. Not able to pin location manually, no option to rename it, search gives other results comparing to Google maps and irrelevant, no integration with Google places. Very disappointing.",
"As I've become more busy, with  more things to do, Todoist has made managing my life incredibly simple.   I didn't use this program much at first, but especially after suffering several mild concussions, I've found Todoist to be absolutely amazing, especially because my memory is temporarily worse than ever.   I could write more about this application, but I believe I've made my point clear.  Thank you to the developers of Todoist. I highly recommend this application to everyone and anyone.",
I've been using Todoist for about 3 weeks now and it has changed the way I get work done. I'm more productive which means I have more time to do what I enjoy doing. The only problem is that some potentially useful features are locked behind a paywall.,
"This app keeps me organized in all the different aspects of my life, from freelance projects, to my full-time job, to life with four little kids. I work across multiple devices and operating systems, often from the web. Todoist handles it all, looks great everywhere, works from the web, and is super fast.  Without this app I would be lost.  P.S. I really like the Android widget for quickly getting tasks into my inbox.",
"Smooth, flawless interface, easy to be organized through devices, and the fun thing is when the task done (or adding task) we earn more points; double fun indeed. The free version is even incredible, couldn't imagine how great the paid version is.",
"This app is AMAZING. I've tried MANY 'to do list' type of apps in the past and I mean a lot. But, honestly, I gave up since I never found an app that was good enough but todoist is great. I found this app on my computer the other day and it's great that I can use it of many places. It's just been 1 day that I've been using this but everything has come to place for me! Super satisfied.",
"I was a long-time user of Any.Do, but I hated that I couldn't see specific due dates for tasks more than a day in the future. I tried this app and feel in love. I do miss Any.Do's reminders (you have to pay for that feature with this app), but I'm still glad I switched because of the dates thing.",
Paying for premium for a couple years. Was a 5 star app now it is too tedious to create a new task and set a reminder. Was a couple of clicks but now I find reminders are not saved because I have to click the arrow twice... The old version was more efficient. Looking at any.do as alternative.,
"Closest I have come to a smart task manager. Encourages you to simplify the way you view things without sacrificing too much flexibility. Aside from some aspects of the UI which are not in accord with the rest of the software in terms of the intuitive way in which it works, I am very happy with both the software and the annual fee for unlocking all the features. I'm sticking with this one for now, and believe me, I've tried quite a few!",
Even without paid features this app is very useful. Good sync between phone and PC (and probably iPad if I had one). Easy to make and mend task lists and sort by category (project). 5 stars,
"That's stupid and reflects poorly on the company. It's not trivial to move projects from Google Tasks (or anything else) to Todoist: No import or related documentation is provided, so the only easy way is to pay an outside service. That means, to _actually_ try this app, you have to subscribe to upgrade and pay to import. Makes me wonder where else they'll be short-sighted or stingy. Support? Security? You couldn't offer a 2-week free trial? Dumb.",
Excellent app. Great flexibility to use as simple check list or multi task level projects . Installed and works without hitches on my galaxy tab.,
Features sync across all devices/apps  Scheduling and Different labels   Can't complain with that even if reminders are offered for premium,
Some of the things locked just to get another script out of me make it pointless. Can do the same with Calender.,
Some things aren't very intuitive. It's hard to tell when I've added a collaborator. I'm never sure if things got added correctly.,
Its super easy to use because you just have to input text instead of navigating here and there to set due/repetition. Like it.,
"Best I've found.  Works well for families.  Would be expensive if all family members paid for premium, but really only one member needs premium to get most of the features.",
"This is a great app.  I have a simple rule: if I can't do something now I add it to the app.  My projects a re already filled with things I want to get done but my inbox and daily views are clean for the needfuls.  I have a few issues with how recurring tasks are handled, but no system is perfect.  My biggest concern is if I become too much of a micro-tasker.",
This is an cool App for task management.But it would have been realy      helpful for beginers if the how to help can be integrates in the app it self.,
Has everything and anything you can ask for when it comes to To Do Lists. Helps you become more efficient and organized (coupled with a few other apps),
Love the integration with GMAIL and the ability to send emails into the app. I wish it did 2 things - provided more options for prioritizing tasks and I wish you could send emails to the app from a tablet or mobile device.,
"It helps you get the job done, simple and easy to use. The feature I miss: progress indicators for tasks in progress.",
I love using this app because its non intrusive but very effective in the way that it prompts you.,
"I would like more features, a more customizable interface,  but I also only have the free version,  so i guess that is my fault. That is all.",
"I use this to pull lists from Amazon Echo, because it's much faster and cleaner than the Echo app. Very, very nice app, even in the free version.",
I use ToDoist for my next actions and as a capture tool.  Combined with evernote Gmail and Google docs they demolish my formerly constant state of overwhelm.,
It's a good app but you have to pay premium to get alerts and reminders. It's still possible to forget tasks because of it.,
Productivity has increased two fold with the use of todoist. I love that I can access it at all times across many platforms. It is very user friendly.,
Excellent application. You can never forget to do the things you ve planned and futhurmore it helps fight procrastination.,
"I wish the paid version didn't cost so much. Great, simplified to do list app none the less. The free version works just fine",
"Looks like a great app but almost every useful feature (reminders, details, labels, filtering, ...) is only for a  available on 'premium' for $27 per year. Why not give us a usable app for free and let us see how good it can be and maybe we'll upgrade to Premium when we believe it's worth it.",
The only app I've found (and I've tried a lot) that consistently helps me to stay productive.,
"This is a very well designed app that has features like swiping to complete tasks, as well as advanced tagging and sorting features.  This is a quality app.",
"Being light, easy to use and not time consuming for interacting, it's really a nice app to have on your smart phone.",
User friendly app thst is overall great. The synchronization aspect with sunrise calendar gives this app an extra edge.,
I don't like this app as it's too basic and doesn't give much options about labels or weekly planning. I am disappointed with the purchase!,
"Except for the sometimes hard to understand natural language for recurring dates, this app rocks. Until a point and touch UI is available for recurring dates, I give it a 5-  Still, it's rock solid.",
"From daily reminders to in-depth task lists, this app really does the trick. Push notifications are helpful, and the interface is very user friendly.",
This app changed my life! I'm so much more productive and on the ball at work and in my personal life now.,
This app has been a pivotal part of getting my school work organized and keeping up with what is due and when.,
This had become my goto app since remember the milk and still love to use it. Took a bit of time to get to use the functionality,
At first look I thought it was to simple. But simplicity of this app is what makes this so great. I have tried them all and this one is worth more than 5 stars.,
Epic. They think of things Google does not like an option to add via share link. And sync with things  I do not even have including Android....which I do.... Hmmm,
I looked at a few options and this is the best I found. It is easy to use but is fairly powerful. This kind of app must take a minimum of time to add a task and this fills the bill on multiple platform.,
"Excellent app,  I use it every day across android, ios and PC's. Everything syncs up perfectly.  Also really impressed with the task sharing features.",
I really do live this app. Been part of my daily work life. Simple and easy to use.,
It keeps me organize. It's really simple and the UI is great. Would love to see more updates.,
This is the only tool I found that keeps me on track in Getting Things Done system.,
Can also connect to chrome and get app for Microsoft. Great tool to keep track of action items.,
"It's really great if you have 100 projects but need help remembering all the facets of them. Wish there was more of a space for just ""notes"".",
"I am on the go and use multiple platforms daily, great app to stay organized.",
I make a project for each class and keep my tasks organized that way - helps make my weeks easier,
Ability to link dependencies (and therefore next action) would bring 5 stars,
Have been using premium for a year now. No complaints. Easily the best to do list app.,
Now part of my daily life. Just the sort of nag I need to keep track of what I need to do.,
I organize my entire life. I am in love with this app. I have it installed EVERYWHERE! I would love for an alarm feature to be added to tasks that have a specific time. Great APP.,
"Best life-managing all-integrated app, works in the background to keep your foreground clear and organised!",
"Works fantastic. Haven't found anything else close. Just a few user ""unfriendly"" quirks.",
"Tried other task managers, but this one is the only one that's actually useful and enjoyable to use.",
It's one of the few apps that I consider worth using.,
Looks like a nice app but you have to upgrade to get anything useful.  But $29 a year is ridiculous!    Bring the price back down to earth and I'll consider using it.,
Love this app it's easy to use not complicated like other apps out there.,
It would be a 5 star if they would let you see the tasks complished on the free version,
Very good apps and support too.  Try it with IFTTT and you can manage your entire life!  Fit well with outlook calendar. This is a must have!,
"This app saves me!   I use it on desktop,  phone,  tablet & integrated with Outlook.   I have a job that has multiple (too many) projects and this let's me categorize and plan.   We also use it as a family for grocery lists and honey-do lists.   It's fabulous!",
I suggest to add a feature of choosing & deleting many tasks instead of deleting each one individually,
Great app for my needs.  Like the ability to flick tasks in from email and the net.,
Relieves headaches from work overload better then tylenol :),
Such an amazing interactive to do list app. Really helps me gets my tasks done and keep my head organised! Love it!,
It helps me remind things very easily and I am really thankful to team,
"Helps managing things pretty easily, App and web both are equally good",
"Feature rich, and intuitive to use. This app is everything you need it to be.",
"I liked it so much, i use it for work and personal stuff!",
"Easy to use, reminders are great.  Keeps me on track with my tasks.",
Great app. Hope that they add an option that you can enter tasks by voice soon,
Using daily mainly as to do list. Best I have found.,
"But there's one problem. When I add new task and say something ""Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday"" and today is Monday, for example, I see the task that starts from Wednesday, not Monday. It's mistake. Correct this, please...",
Most of the essential features were not paid.,
"Amazing app, I cannot live without it.",
Helps me get my work done and reminds me I need to do stuff,
Fantastic tool for all my responsibilities in life. There is nothing like it on the market.,
"Like it for its simple to use interface, reminder facility.",
"I especially like the integration of Outlook, Chrome,  and Android.",
"Easy to stay organized in the minute, and syncs across devices.",
Neat n clean UI. Working of the app is cool. Lovin it.,
"Use the app, web and outlook interface and it all syncs flawlessly",
Would love to be able to default a project,
All you need to keep tasks on time,
"So far So Good, does what it say it would do",
I wish this app a bright future and more new great functions,
Really expensive app but delivers good value.,
Really helps me stay on task.,
It's a great tool for school.,
Finally found a todo app that works for me... Great app,
Really helps me keep track of my productivity level which keeps me motivated to keep doing more,
"Simple, convenient,  essential",
With premium you can sync to your calendar... love it!,
My GF told me about this app to track your training and plans and it is awesome,
Really helps with organization and keeping myself on track.,
5 stars if it had a calendar view,
I use very basic features and it works fine,
This app is great for task management.,
The nonfree version misses the basic functions,
excellent.  near faultless and continually improving.,
Awesome app. My productivity when up 10x,
Cannot exist without it.,
Nice and lite.  Work fine on win10,
Best to list for our video company.,
Good task list,
The best task manager on Android,
Very handy for folks who love being paperless.,
1800rur/year for own task comments and labels? Perhaps the app is cool but at the moment no chance to check it by myself.,
It looks that  a good thought has been put into its design and features and layout perfect no complains so far i love using this software,
... especially when you combine it with IFTTT functionality.,
Best to do list!,
This app is great!,
The best. Enough said.,
Very nice app !!!,
For features mostly found standard in similar apps?  Pass...,
Is there a feature for creating tasks that repeat?,
Nice app!!!,
My favorite task app,
Intuitive and effective,
Easy to use and very useful,
Boosts productivity,
"Berguna sekali buat saya, karena sederhana tapi terintegrasi ke pc, mobile maupun web.",
Great app.,
Really useful app,
Excellent. .,
Do we have subtask feature?,
Very useful,
Use it all the time,
Works across devices!!,
Awesome app,
Good one,
Good software,
Really love it,
Great app,
Efficient,
Love it,
Great,
Excellent,
I've been on it 5 minutes and already think it's amazing. It's like it read my mind and knows exactly what I need/want in a to do app. Super customizable so I can turn it to my whims and uses. I can't believe I never heard of it before. Will add to all my devices and check back in when I've had time to explore more. Yay!,
"One thing that I miss is an open field for a responsible.. Just like when I.delegate shared projects. Most of the times I delegate things for people who don't use todoist, and I just want to write it there.. As a workaround I use personalised labels :/",
"Years of searching & testing for the right feature mix in a to do list has ended.  I've consulted to many end users - all needed their list to manage is some unique way.  This app handles them all.  The inbox quick pre-assignment of details is great.  The project + label levels allow focused follow-up. Summation notifications,  reminders, and task sharing round out long list of useful features.  May seem a little pricey for a mobile app until you realize that your list is available multi-platform. Good job!",
"I love it.  I have been looking for an app like this for some time. This really does everything that I want, particularly given that it will sync between so many devices. I can't recommend it more highly.",
Tried all the to-do/GTD apps out there.  Best one IMO.  Simple yet feature rich for more demanding users.  Intuitive web and mobile apps.  Integrated well with many email services to keep all your tasks in one place.,
Todoist really help me to remember my daily to do list. Thanks guys for making it happen,
"I've been pretty successful at learning my way around and set up has been easy. No troubles on my nexus 5, some crashing with the iPad app.",
"Have used other similar apps but none come close to functionality, simplicity and ease of use.",
"Best to do list I've used. Web interface and android app work great together. Very task oriented, easy to use interface.",
Great app been using for a check list for a house move and does exactly what it says on the tin. Recommended on note 4 running Lollipop.,
I couldn't function without this app. Integration with Outlook and Exchange makes this app a no-brainer for me,
Really nice and well designed. Multiplatform. Lacking features are kanban and task timers(pomodoro) integration.,
"This app is awesome in many ways,if you cant get yourself organized with todoist than you are completely lost my friend",
I use it with Trello at work and in my personal life to make sure I never forget an idea or a task. The windows app is also fantastic,
"I have used Todoist for almost a year now and my life would not be the was without it. I am an avid list maker and this app is just wonderful and easy to use. I am a paying, AND HAPPY customer. You go Todoistians!",
Those previews of tasks that appear in the new task area....why? ...I dont even take portugese classes. Inputting tasks for future dates not as easy as it was before. Color themes shud be available for the free version......old layout was way better...,
This app is truly helping me keep track of everything going on in my life so I stay focused and not forget everything. Overall very easy and intuitive to use.,
"It would be extremely nice to have the quick add ""task added"" overlay back. The little grey notification which always appeared at the bottom after pressing the add task button.",
"This has to be one of the easiest, effective, and we'll laid out To Do apps that I have used. And this is coming from Google Reminders and Any. DO",
"The recurring scheduling can be a little bit of a climb to get used to, but one you do it is great!",
Wish to it had a windows 10 desktop app :( I use a chrome app and chrome extension when I'm on my desktop and i use the mobile app but would prefer a desktop app for windows 10. That's the only thing holding me back from upgrading.,
"Sometimes I want the features that are only in the paid version, but it is great for a free app.",
Availability across difderent platforms is a big advantage. Probably no support for the latest platforms but i think it will catch up,
Simple and easy to use mostly. Recurring tasks a little tricky,
I love how its on my Google toolbar and it really helps keep me organized.,
"It definitely makes me more productive, I just wish it was more customizable.",
"They need to have a reoccurring task, like every saturday, etc",
I am rating it 5stars but i do mind that when I assign a task that my employes can change it and than I can't assign a task to only a few people in the project...so either 1 or all...why not 2?,
Easily the best task list of all that I have tried.,
"Best for collaboration. Multiple lists, multiple groups, awesome!",
After 1 month free trial I will be upgrading for sure.,
"Does everything you want it to on multiple platforms, simply amazing",
Reminders are a pretty basic function but one needs to upgrade for that :(,
Love the UI and the ability to recognize time. Very smooth and easy,
Really easy to get set up in every platform I use,
I like it. Its helped me out a lot.,
Get points after a completed task.. Great idea.,
Replaced my pocket notebook to do list.,
It's practical tool to help organize the day to day activities,
Simple & love the user interface :),
I love it,
I wish I got this long ago,
I like the cross platform support,
No reason to complain.,
Greatest to do to date 5 out of 5 stars,
It is a very helpful app,
Simple to use and effective!!,
It's my daily routine,
Please bring back the multiple select.,
Mahal. Harus bayar mahal untuk bisa mendapatkan fitur2 penting,
Yuuup,
It's  good enough.,
Love it!,
Best to do list app,
Best todo app sofar,
"yes,  i used To do list about 14 days. i very like it. I can sync all smartphone,  website,  app.",
User friendly,
Awesome,
"Since there are many To Do apps, you might as well find one that you like using. I wanted to like this one because it's well-featured. In the end, I chose Any.do and now have the paid version. I like the reminders and overall design. For projects and more complex tasks, I'm using Asana.",
"This is the best GSD app I've used. Hands down. Instead of having different lists for different projects, I now use this. It's so clean and very easy to use. Dragging and dropping tasks in and out of your schedule is quick and easy, as is scheduling recurring tasks. It syncs with the desktop version seamlessly. It also tracks your productivity using a chart thingy. Love love love this!",
"Very simple and straight forward app to quickly get everything you need to get done all in one place and in order of urgency. My only gripe is the puerile Karma earning system and corollary labels used to designate where you are in the hierarchy. I got enough sources of reasons to be self-critical, thank you very much.",
"It would be better if the multi-levels were more obvious. It's easy to confuse a sub level to be the same level as what's above it. Maybe a colored line or something. Other than that I love it! :D The feature I love the best about it from its competitors is the ability to create subtasks that you can still manipulate as if it's a normal task, and isn't hidden.",
"Highly productive application. As someone who uses to-do lists extensively, I can say that this app offers seamless list design features and an uncluttered, accessible UI. I don't have access to certain superior organizational features as they must be purchased, but it honestly doesn't make a difference. I highly recommend this app for the layman user.",
Lots of features and integration. I think this can keep growing still and get even better. Would love to see time frames integrated so you can see how much busy time you have assigned for one day so you don't overbook... there are workarounds but integrated would be nice,
I was a Todoist Premium subscriber for almost two years but I have recently moved to another To-Do service.  Todoist was REALLY great when it worked but unfortunately the service is VERY buggy.  I've never spent so much time debugging issues and opening bugs for a tool/service.  A lot of times I felt like a QA tester for them.  I may consider going back to Todoist in the future when they get more mature.  At this time it feels like they don't have any type of change management or testing procedures and that the Devs are constantly throwing new and untested changes into production.,
"Is there any offline version of this? That also can be used without log in. I would like if there is offline version because connection is not everywhere and everytime can be used. No login version also would be good in my opinion because I don't really like to login. Thanks for the attention and sorry for the inconvenient. Okay, thanks for the respond. I just don't like to login and my information will be synced to the server.",
Particular like the ability to categorize and annotate notes and to link in with Gmail. Worth subscribing to get full feature set.,
"Me reminded of all the things I need to do even if I don't get them done by my deadline, at least I don't forget them.",
"the one thing that could be better is, I wish I could have the tasks in a project sorted by due date, instead of by time added or by sorting them all manually. recurring tasks and user interface are great.",
"Good integration with Cloudmagic, throw it all in there and get it done m8, easy life. Membership def worth imo",
"I've tried a LOT of to-do managers on both android and ios, and trust me. This is the best. I've stuck with it for more than a year how and my tasks management is on point.",
I wasn't sure a to do list app would work for me but it really has been great. It's quick and simple. I get satisfaction swiping away completed tasks,
"I was looking for an app to keep me organised, I'm so happy I stumbled upon this one. It has kept me on track with all my work at home and at the office.",
Updated. Been using this for 4 years. Tried others (call me fickle) but always come back.,
It's been really reliable and helpful at time-management wise. also it compatible in multiple platforms. no bugs or glitchs. runs smooth and looks good. Recommended !,
Really cant think of a more useful app. Would really like to be able to attach voice notes more easily however.,
".. this is the mother of all list makers. It has replaced hundreds of paper notes, post-its and paper napkins for me. All this stuff in one little app.  Sounds great, doesn't it? Even better; all the lists you make is available everywhere (pc, Mac, Mac, tablet, iPhone, Web etc) for editing. And did I mention that it looks great. Only place you can't find  your list , is on paper.. and that's good. I love this app,  so much that I even pay them extra money, to improve my life even a little extra.",
Used to be quite buggy but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. The best app for this purpose on Android.,
"Great app, easy to operate and organize. Can be as simple or as complicated as you want. Widget is helpful too. Just wish there was an option to disable the productivity feedback the app gives you.",
"Tried several to-do list apps before landing on this one. I can easily separate items by day or by project,  so I can make a long list of sub tasks.  (I.e., clean kitchen includes a task for loading the dishwasher, cleaning the stove, sweeping the floors etc)",
I've been using this app for over a year and it's a huge helper for me. It really helps to keep my tasks organized,
"Awesome interface, easy to use, absolutely love the sharing which has been a major issue with other apps.",
Overall a solid to-do/productivity app. Some really useful integrations with other apps and gizmos. The Toggl hook up is particularly handy.,
"It's very easy to add the task in the app by just using everyday keywords. Nice app, but Google Calendar sync should be provided.",
"After trying out many others, I settled on ToDoist for its ease of use, amazing functionality, very nice design and its cross-platform stability. I upgraded to a year of premium after only a week and, several months later, I'm still happy with my decision. This is a fantastic app and one of my essential GTD tools.",
This is a fantastic app that has allowed me to organize my life. I wish it was still as simple to input a time when adding a quick task.,
"Really nice and user friendly, sync works great across all my devices,  use it on daily basis.",
It is great tool for take order and become more productive. I would like more settings for colors and icons,
Outlook integration has made this app stick to my workflow. Thank you!,
Kinda can't remember how I got things done and paid on-time before todoist. It's the witch's brew.,
"Have used the Website for some time, but the addition of the phone app has improved things even further",
I am experiencing difficulties in using the app. It should be simplified.,
"The best to-do app I found on the market. Love to pay premium, these guys deserve it :)",
Every update is an actual improvement unlike most apps.  The Todoist team is really on point. Great work,
"Is there no compact view? I want to see my tasks in just one window, without needing to scroll down. Please have view settings",
Elegant and functional. It just works. A great contribution to my work environs.,
Haven't missed a task yet!,
for me it was the best suited app for Getting Things Done,
Had it for a week and it's helping. Pretty intuitive and great integration online and on other devices!,
"It's fast, easy and syncs. What more do you want. Great Gtd tool.",
The app needs options for sorting tasks by date and by priority.,
Does exactly what I wanted. The IFTTT link to Google Calendar app is ideal for me.,
Especially in the widget.,
Needs a paid version to do most of the useful stuff.,
Not only does it remind you if he emails you of all your task,
I am very happy to use todoist so i can control my schedule easily,
Does exactly what you want from a to do list,
Great little help app to keep your crazy world organised!,
Excellent tool to keep track of what needs to be done and what has been accomplished.,
It is really great app to keep track of all the appointments and tasks due.,
Very useful app. I recommend it too everyone.,
"Perfect. Best productivity app there is, period.",
Great for tracking multiple lists across multiple devices.,
"Great app, easy to use and simple",
Excellent in every way,
Best I've found to date.,
Still good. Loving the new design,
Looooovvvvvvveeeee IT!,
Helped me organize my work life,
important features are missing..,
Good and customizable,
Very useful and simple to use.,
Nice and simple - outlook integration needs work,
Best implementation of a todo list I've seen. Simple.. Gets the job done...fast!,
"A most trusted, dependable friend.. exceptional versatility...",
Great Great Great :) My favourite app,
Love it,
Very good App.,
Useful and great app.,
What kind of logic is this? You need to get the premium version for getting reminders... Wow!,
I love it. Can you make the widget transparent?,
It is so useful,
Easy to use and,
Good.,
No reminder functionality in free version?,
Does what I need,
Cool App,
Loved it,
Excellent,
Great,
Some,
Works well,
Goodapp,
"I use to love this app until they did the ""upgrade'"" now it is the most un user friendly app in the world any task that I try move it places in 2016. When inserting a new task it does not ask me when or which project, so I have to put it in today then go change it to the day & project I want. You had an excellent app, now it is just frustrating. It needs to improve or I wont be renewing.",
Now its fun and much convinient to make a to do list. Now i m addicted to it as it is first thing i do in morning and most of my tasks complete in time. Tasks whose deadline is quite late are easier to remember. And its- delaying a task feature is awesome :P coz now i m not guilty and depressed of anything ... Totally loved it (Y),
"Didn't use it before so I don't know what the interface was but the new interface is easy to use. I like being able to put in the item, the date and the priority all in one line and having the program know what I'm talking about. Only time that backfires is if I'm trying to put a word like ""morning l in the item description. But I've even learned how to work around that. And the web interface/sync is super useful.",
The free version is simple and easy to add tasks. I like that you can set priorities. The only suggestion I would make is to have priorities be a band of color (to highlight the event as more important) for the whole task that is the said priority because it is hard to see just a small vertical stripe. I hope it is a change the developers consider.,
"I have gone through a lot of organization apps trying to find the best ones, and this is exactly what I was looking for. This app is perfect for day to day tasks because it is organized in such a way that it is easy to see everything that you need to do for the day, but it is also easy to see what you need to do for the next week or for a specific group of tasks. I use a different app  for project management things, but this excels in daily use because of how easy and quick it is to add a new task.",
"I use Todoist daily.  Very good product.  I am not pleased with update.  Tasks are longer and more cumbersome to create.  I would prefer previous version. As for the note screen, I take extensive notes; however, the note screen is small, so I constantly need to scroll up and down to take a look at all the notes.  I have to use a secondary application to take long notes.  This note app is good for very short notes.  Again a good product.",
"Looked at this a few years ago when I first started out with GTD and it didn't work for me. So glad i had another look because right now it is way ahead of anything else - simple, stylish and integrates with everything i need it to.  Evernote and Outlook are huge wins for me.  And the Today view is streamlined and focused on what i need to do now.  Easily the best GTD app out there.  Less setup and more things done than with anything else.",
I converted from another task system tool to this and haven't looked back. Love the multiplatform capabilities. Appreciate the UI especially on android. Notification system is great. The karma system is a great motivator. I think the business and collaborative project system is ideal and awesome. Easy to operate a business.  It's not complete in a full proof software. Would love to see multiple task edits. Incorporated calendar into the app (Sunrise or Google). Templates with common scripts for tasks.,
"(1) Provide alternative email address entry for reminder, currently it only send reminder to email that you registered, as it would be great to differentiate work and personal. (2) would be even great if you can link a flight schedule that you booked. (3) very slow SMS notification on +60",
It satisfies as my average to-do-list. It really helps me and keeps me very organized. There are no ads at all which is great but only one bug..when I didn't complete a task or something it reminds me everyday which is bugging but I understand that it is trying to let me know to do the task even though I kno I finished. But overall it's a great app.,
"Design Suggestion. The FAB is awesome for quickly adding tasks/lists, but the UX for this is bad at the moment. You have to add a task and then with another swipe gesture edit more details about the task. I suggest going straight to the menu that appears after clicking edit task, straight from the FAB press.",
"I loved how organized it kept my tasks and how simple it was to check a task off from the home screen. Recently though, the widget won't switch between inbox and any of the projects. Once I select my shopping list for example, the widget shows the same tasks/items as inbox, but when I try to confirm that I tapped on the list I wanted, the drop down menu shows that ""shopping"" is highlighted, acting as if the inbox items I see in the widget are in the shopping list. When I open the app, it works correctly.",
"I really like this app. With this type of app, most agree that functionality is king. If it is not functional you don't really have anything. The little things really make a big difference. Please keep being very careful with your redesigns. Please continue trying to keep us all happy. With that in mind, the new design seems more elongated than before so it may take slightly longer to scroll. Thank you so much for your work. I really appreciate it.",
"A few people mentioned that it is difficult to add tasks... maybe there has been a fix since then, but I didn't have couldn't be easier, there is a plus sign at the bottom right. I like the different options it has manage life- from projects which can be renamed or using calendar short hand to add an agenda item. Great app so far~",
"The automatic date function makes inputting some items difficult. For instance, if I want to read chapter 3, section 2, I would normally input ""Read Ch 3.2"" However, now that input is automatically changed to ""Read Ch"" on March 2nd. Furthermore, the popup in the new design takes up far too much space and could be made to be more compact.",
"Still love the design of the Chrome & Mac app, dont like the design for Android app. I totally agree, you've messed this up. Still one of my favorites, but please fix the design (inconsistency). Also, mobile app is neither showing sub projects nor related tasks in the overview window when the respective master project is highlighted, Chrome/Mac app does.",
"I really liked this app but the new design has made it a lot more difficult for me. Particularly annoyed at the huge text for the titles as it takes up over half of my screen, and I can't see all the options when I input a task. The colour scheme is also really hard on my eyes, I always have problems with light text on bright coloured screens (ie on the menu that pops up when you hit schedule) Is there any way to return to the previous version? I'm running Android KitKat at the moment but will probably be installing Lollipop soon.",
"As a project manager, this has become a crucial part of getting things done. I prefer to input a majority tasks on the website but find the mobile app a great way to keep everything with me. Way better than the Onenote lists I was using",
"ToDoIst falls short of the GTD mantra in one key way: the focus is on setting labels, reminders, and projects at the time of task creation, and not IN BULK. With GTD you are supposed to dump all of your ideas into an inbox, then move each idea/task into smaller chunks with labels, reminders, projects IN BULK. This is to decrease the TIME and ENERGY it takes to create a workflow. With ToDoIst you have to INDIVIDUALLY edit each task's label, reminder, and project. This is a huge waste of time when you have 20 things in your inbox that need to be quickly sorted. It's, ironically, almost the complete opposite of the GTD mantra. All in all I think TDI is fantastic, but there really needs to be a ""bulk"" edit option to really take it to the next level. I understand that you can do this with due dates, but that's pretty much it. This needs to be applied to labels, reminders, and projects as well. If I need to quickly label 5 tasks as ""y"" and 8 tasks with reminders, I should not have to edit 13 different tasks independently.",
To do apps tend to either be way to feature rich and complex while others are a small step above notepad.  This one has enough features to help you sort through what needs to be done and triage what can wait for later.  The windows version is a little buggy but can't complain.  Synced across all my devices I'm good to go.  I was a little skeptical about the yearly subscription but after getting a month to try it out I'm strongly considering adding it.,
"I adore this app, but since the last update it's extremely glitchy. Please fix this.. I miss my well working amazing app.  I re-installed the app and it's still freezing. When I open the app and move a task from let's say Wednesday to Monday it freezes and I have to shut down the app. This didn't ever happen before I updated it.",
"Reply: I could also specify the due date and the project in the older version when adding a task, but cannot in this version. That's why I mean it's slow.                   The older UI is way faster to add a task. The new interface wants to show that it is smart, but actually the lack of usefulness makes it look stupid. I am a premium member and I pay for saving time, not good looking only.",
"It sounds like a job title or a role.  That is because if you are able to master the art of filtering the constant flood of data thrown at you into todo lists, you will be more productive and in fact be a ""todoist"".  Are there places for improvement, yes.  Would love to see tighter integration with Google Now reminder cards and calendar.  But it has replaced any.do as my GTD tool.",
"I've tried multiple to-do apps and this one is by far my favorite. It's easy to use, speedy, and syncs across my devices. I haven't tried project sharing or any pro features, so I can't comment on them. My only dislike is the material-design-like animations are not fluid.",
"I especially love that fact that saying something like ""Note to self buy paper towels tomorrow"" to Google Now will result in Todoist creating a reminder tomorrow, just like typing it into the app. Just wish the buttons on notifications didn't cut off text.",
"I like the new look however adding a task isn't as quick and easy as before the new design. Please let us use the old version. I am a subscriber but do not want to renew if it's going to be more than one step to add a category or labels. UPDATED: While I appreciate the reply, I am not sold. I  have to type a lot more- or remember the abbreviations- to add to different projects and labels. I am not renewing my subscription at this  point. It's too bad, I used the old version on a daily basis.",
"To use anything but the most basic features you have to subscribe to the premium version for a $30 yearly fee. I understand the developer needs to make money and for the power user premium makes sense. I don't use it for work though so I don't need subtasks and projects but I would like to have reminders and multiple themes, even if they were purchased a la carte. As it is I will be going back to Any.Do until I can find something better.",
"I really like the aesthetic appeal of the new design, but I'm not a fan of the changes in functionality. I can't input a number as the first part of a task anymore or it automatically turns it into a date, which is stupid, and the notification banner covers up the menu to change things, meaning setting the date on three tasks takes up to a full minute where before it was less than 10 seconds. Can we get a more productive design instead of a prettier one next time?",
"After going through many other 'to do' apps, I'm back to using Todoist. Simply the best. And please, please keep the material design as it is, including the new flow. It's awesome and I'm confident that the other users need to simply get used to it and they'll love it as well at some point. Keep up the awesome work!",
"Just noticed that when I select a date for a task via the Calendar tool it records the day before instead. Please fix this glitch, otherwise it's a great tool for keeping track of my to-do items. 8 Apr '15: glitch is still there - I select Thursday (say) for a to-do item and then moments later it changes it To Friday! What's going on? UPDATE 14 Jul '15: If I have a to-do item dated in the past and I go to edit the date, it automatically assumes the date is from next year! Please fix this.",
"This is a crowded market. Todoist is expensive. I open it and it doesn't recognise that I have tasks in my Google calendar, despite my using my Google account to register. So, uninstall and go back to ProDo, which is better in every way -- and syncs with Google. Life's too short to nurse an app -- it has to be right first time.",
Very easy to use excellent app to organize your to do list. The widget that comes with the app does everything and looks beautiful. In my 2 weeks of use i have not encountered any bugs or errors of any sort .I don't think a to do list app can get better than this. I would highly recommend this to everyone.,
"This awesome thing helps me keep track of action-items I always used to forget. Instead of going full circle, and coming back after a month to find a task incomplete, I now have an app to nag me until it's done. In a way, Todoist is like having mom around, all the time.",
"I love the windows version and the Android app.  Is there a tutorial on how to make use of the changes in the new Android upgrade?  I don't know if this is how it is meant to be, but when adding a task, I don't have a choice of the project.  Everytning I enter defaults to inbox and with today's date.  Then I must select the task to make changes.  It isn't a huge problem for me right now, because I enter most of my tasks on PC.  But from time to time when I travel I do use the mobile to enter things.    Excellent product, though -- I recommend it frequently.",
"Just started using this and it is fantastic! A few things I'd like added though. Google now cards. Linked subtasks. Like if the main task requires completion by the 10th all subtasks need to be done on or before, and if you change the date of the main task the sub tasks would change accordingly. Finally I'd like integration with some sort of pomodoro timer? Other than that I love this app!",
"UPDATE: The large widget seems to be broken. Tasks entered using it aren't saved. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but get the same result. It's a pretty significant issue, particularly if you enter several tasks without noticing that they are disappearing into the ether. Changed from five stars to one.  [This is keeping me organized across three different jobs and multiple projects. Haven't played with the new date parsing stuff, but I've been quite satisfied with the app. Well worth the price.",
"The Material design is awesome, though I'd love a redesigned widget to compact the tasks. I also get continually frustrated with the auto-date thing when I'm typing a task's name. For the love of God, let me turn that off. The themes are awesome. Also, great for letting me reorient labels!! Now if we could only translate that to the web app.",
"Downgraded from 5 stars. Too flashy and difficult to use now. It was better when it was simple. I hate adding tasks with the new interface - can't see what I'm doing and it turns any word related to time into a due date and removes the word from the task. After 2 years of premium, I think I have to find a new to do app :-(",
"And I never looked back. There are a few things that I miss, but for the most part, this service is superior. The best features in my opinion are the frequent and thoughtful updates as well as the fact that this service is more or less on any platform you could want. Keep it up!",
"Hate the new task entry.  I do not want to type a quasi-instruction sequence.  I want the easy selection process in the quick add version.  And you keep changing the name Tom to the date tomorrow.  Ridiculous!  What is more ridiculous, upon further review, is that the dialogue for adding tasks is still there- but you didn't provide any info to tell us that!  A long press on the + sign shows the dialogue in an improved design over previous iterations.  But why do you force us to be lucky and discover it like we were playing a video game?  C'mon, man!  Trumpet the fact that you provided a smooth option.",
I had some problem in start but apps its great now. Just one thing: its to white. Need black version of apps and widget. On widger also is to much space between weeks or task. So if you eliminate this space will be better. And support is great.,
"Todoist is not the most aesthetically attractive of the various task list apps out there, but for the most part, it is very functional. It's easy enough to quickly add tasks in the app, but I personally prefer adding things online or through the web app because it's much faster to type than it is to keep tapping keys on my phone.  What I like most about the app is that it is easily customizable. The app doesn't have any default categories to start you with; you are free to create ""projects"" viewable in the side bar as you wish, or none if that's more your style. This is the case for pretty much all of the other functions: they work, but if you don't feel like using them you don't have to.   If you like keeping a task list, at the end of the day it doesn't really matter which tools (digital or non-digital) you use to do it as long as you are effectively getting things done. Todoist is a great choice, but if you don't like the layout there are plenty of other options.",
The update sucks.  Give me the option to downgrade please. If I wanted this much aggravation I'd write my task list on toilet paper updated: they gave me the APK to go back to the old design. all is well with the world.,
"They make it seem totally awesome and useful. But you have to buy the full version for like, I think it was $30 a year... for this to be even close to useful. But it's like, I DONT want to pay that, just to get a notification for the things on my to do list, or to change the theme color of the app. The amount of things the app doesn't allow you to do, unless your willing to $$, is making this free version so disappointing for me and unbelievably useless. Just being honest.",
"I'm a PM and I never forget about any details (immediate or long-term) because I just set due dates out, even months away. It syncs with my phone, browser, and has a desktop app. Notebooks can't compare. I love that I can break things out by project and create sub-tasks, filter, prioritize, reorder.. It's such a clean and user-friendly interface.",
I have been an avid and daily user of Todoist for a long time.  It was 5 stars for me before the update.   Now it is cumbersome and difficult to navigate.  I have tried to embrace it but just can't get there.  Sorry but I will be looking for a new App.  I am so disappointed as I loved it before!,
"Not too simple, but not overly complex, either. Two small items I would like to see improved: more streamlined notes (entering & exiting) and ability to add tags when tasks are created.",
"Loved it before.  I agree with others about the upgrade.  From my standard 7 day view, I have to create a task, then go back in to edit it in order to place it in proper project.  Makes adding a task a bulky process when it used to be so streamlined.  Is there something I am missing?  Also, try typing ""game night"" as a task.  The new auto time recognition thing messes it up every time. Hanging on to this app on the hopes that you'll come to your senses and give us back the prior functionality we loved.",
"For so expensive service I'd expect, among 24/7 online availability (which is there, luckily), also a perfect UI that simplifies tasks mgmt. Unfortunately, it's not the case, also after the redesign for 'material' approach. I ended up many times when I believed I created a task with reminders etc., whereas due to unfortunate action (pressing back because there was no 'Done'/'Finish'  button) I just lost my entry. Apart from that, the feature list doesn't really justify the price.",
"Having tried a number of todo apps, and having been let down by one of the original pay-for providers, this is a refreshing change. Seems to work well, is clean and stable. My only complaint would be that it's reminders just aren't naggy enough. Bit too easy to dismiss.",
"The updated UI makes it very tedious to enter new tasks, or reschedule existing tasks. The effects make it slower, and the way the look & feel changes (such as just to pick when task is due) is jarring, causing an additional mental context switch. I'll give it a couple weeks to see if any options to return to a usable UI become available, otherwise I plan to switch back to my 'Remember the Milk' premium subscription instead.",
I love this app and that it syncs on my phone and computer so its always up to date.  The only thing that would make it perfect is if the premium features were also free.,
"This update is supposed to be streamlined, but I find it more difficult to add tasks. Tasks are also not listed in order of priority. Most annoying of all is that while trying to place overdue tasks for a new date, it keeps scrolling back to the top, making me constantly look for old tasks.",
"Tried almost everything else out there, but kept coming back to Todoist. Now I've settled on it and have been using it for a year. The free version is good enough for keeping track of day to day tasks. If you haven't tried it - Highly recommend you do so now.  For the todoist team: The new update automatically recognises days of the week if you type it as a task, and schedules it accordingly. This is a problem because quite often, I only mean it as a task description, and it's annoying when todoist automatically schedules it. A confirmation would be nice, so I can dismiss it if required.  The material design update rocks BTW.",
"This app used to be great, but now it is frustrating to use. Please keep it simple not clever. Takes too long now to add a task and go back and edit it the way you want it. And how frustrating to change the default time of a task!",
"the premium service is not cheap too. The free app is ok for simply listing daily/weekly tasks.  2 functions it lacks: a) view completed tasks - this is quite important. if i accidentally tick off a task and i need it back on the to-do list later on, i have to retype it and i am unable keep a log of the tasks i have completed previously b) commenting on tasks is disabled on the free app - this is a problem as i cannot plan and add details, which cripples the organizing function of the app and limits the free version to a list  of course, all of the above is fair, given that the app is free. For me, it's just a pity that the premium functions which make the app great are simply way too expensive",
"Thus is your basic running to do list. Not many bells and whistles, it's simple and effective for what it needs. I love the week view.  If I could make a suggestion, make a way at the end of the day to push all unfinished tasks to tomorrow at one time.",
"It's like this was made for me. Since I downloaded it, it helps me stay focused and on task. As reminds me daily on things I need to complete. Tip: schedule things to do before the due date and not on the day of.",
"Flexible, but requires to many taps/keystrokes to get things done (both web and mobile version). Examples for mobile version: adding task with due time or reminder is a pain: it requires a lot of typing, switching to numeric keyboard, to symbolic keyboard and back and forth. Why not just add a slideable ""timer"" UI control like in many alarm apps?  Also, is it possible at all to batch move few tasks to another project in mobile version? Looks like features were cut in order to  oversimplify design.  Also, is dark UI theme going to be available?",
"Down from 4 stars. The Material Design update looks nice, but it's functionality is clumsy & cumbersome. The old version was better. I dislike the overzealous parser. It interprets words like ""tomorrow"" or ""Tuesday"" to be due dates; so ""confirm meeting for Tuesday"" makes the due date next Tuesday, when you've either missed the meeting or are too early! This happens even if you overrode the parser's due date then go back to edit the task later! For 2 years as a paid, premium member, I've seen a zillion bugs.",
"I used to really like this app, but the recent updates to the interface have been terrible. It now takes much longer to enter in a task if you want to enter in any information beyond the name of the task itself. Hopefully they fix it. In the interim I need to find a new app.",
"I've been using the app for a couple of months now and it does work for my needs.   The more I use the app it the more fluid it becomes which makes me more efficient.  I would recommend it for the person who is going to use it as a tool, not just a to do list.  The only issue I have had is that I have to re-boot it on a regular basis, which is a bit inconvenient.  I'm not sure if that is an app issue or Windows??   Thanks for the app.",
I've tried quite a few and this one if the best by far. Love how you can easily share tasks  and keep track of things to remember.,
"Look, I love change. I really do. But this latest update is awful. Everything looks good (sorta...) but it's a functional tool, not a social media app. I don't care about it's looks, I care about it's functionality. Before this update, adding a task from the widget was simple and you didn't have to type out all this nonsensical jargon. Either change the widget to be the way it used to be or undo the entire update. Whatever you do, please prioritize functionality and efficiency over looks. Looks are useless.",
"Task creation is now a frustration, I always put references to dates/times/hours in my task names, but they disappear because Todoist decides I'm being stupid and want to make that a date or time.  At least make it an option to turn off the date suggestion.  I love Todoist on the Web and use it daily as a premium member...but this new input feature is just painful.  Also, fix the advanced project filtering please!",
"I haven't used this app much yet,but I am excited to have it and all of its potential. Glad I download it. Happy so far.",
"Really like it, only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the pay model, too much is stripped from the free version.",
Due date no longer working correctly after update. E.g. ev 2 weeks starting 14 July will only use the ev 2 drops the starting.,
This update was very unfortunate. The app looks better but it is much harder to create tasks. That part is really an unfortunate failure. It takes way too long to add a task now. Looks like Im going to have to go back to Wunderlist which is truly a shame. I really like the outlook plugin for todoist but this update is annoyingly unfriendly. Remembering abbreviations? In the age of advance GUIs? This was a really misdirected update. I unfortunately will not be renewing. Dont defend this mistake. Fix it quick,
"New July '15 version nice and a bit easier. It still needs a simple way to finish a repeating task is over, like a school or job project.",
"Seems like a decent app, a little clunky about the entry of to do items, but good for managing them.  The fact you can't add notes unless you upgrade...a little bit too miserly if you ask me.",
"I have no real gripes about it. My only complaint would be the price of premium. I wish it wasn't a subscription but an outright purchase. Way more robust than Wunderlist and Any.Do, just too pricey for the sub.",
"I opened my mind to the new design and focused myself on the ""why"" behind the changes. With patience I started to understand the reason for the new design and used the app the way I thought it was intended. I actually like how the updated app works for me more than earlier versions. That was not my initial reaction to the new version.",
Enjoying using the mobile app but can't get the desktop app to work in Windows.,
Very confusing on how to setup a subtasks in latest Android version. Have yet to be able to do it.... deal breaker for me.,
I didn't think it would ever happen but I gave my Daytimer and colored pens. Keep improving it but it is a great product already.,
"After the latest update, the new Material Design has just took over my heart! The way things show up, and the color scheme used is just plain awesomeness. Would vote it 5, but sometimes the app tends to respond slowly! I'm pretty sure it is just a temporary bug and will be fixed! Hats off to this amazing application!",
but the last update made the input form less practical. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars,
One bug I've noticed is when you have to many projects your not able to scroll down.,
It has a simple interface and is ready to use. Sync across the app and web interface is quite good. Quite easy to manage tasks and projects.,
All good.  And hreat fpr team work.  Only downside didn't work great with my macbook.    I'm sure they fix that soon.,
"You expect me to pay $30 usd up front for a year (no monthly payment options) for features you didn't even give me the opportunity to test drive? No thanks, I'll give my money to Any.Do",
"Particularly the widgets and repeated tasks. It says you can use straight English,  but really only in a prescribed sentence format. So a GUI would be preferable.",
No ad even if you stick to the free version. Clearly the best To-do app I've tried so far. Still don't know if the extra features are worth paying for (relatively cheap).,
"needs a lil bit too much effort to manage tasks (clicks, taps, drags etc.) but perfect on the rest. love the karma system though.",
This design sucks. Use to be best designed app for todo list now they have made it most complicated app in todo list.,
Good app to help me keep up with my tasks throughout the day. Will probably upgrade to the premium version in the near future.,
"The old version had better functionality, and easier to use.   This app is still a lifesaver, but not as pleasant to use.",
"Simple, effective. Includes ""gamification"" (your karma score) if that's your thing, but doesn't ram it down your throat if such things arent a motivator for you. Premium is a bit expensive IMHO.",
"Easy to use and works well with smart watch, dont need to by any upgrades because this suits my needs, thanks.",
"If there's a better to-do app I haven't found it. I use this for critical work goals and for personal use. It is elegant, simple, and performs flawlessly. It's a model of how every productivity app should work.",
"Todist fit so seamlessly into what I needed to help me with time management, that I immediately began to wonder how I had gotten along without it. It's so simple and so effective. Todoist hits that sweet spot.",
Love using the app and integrating with outlook. Very handy and easy to use. No technical issues thus far after using about 2 months,
I Have used and implement this tool for my business and personal life over a year. I like the GTD methodology.  I Have had a few tech glitches but they were fixed shortly.  The Web and Android platforms are primarily used.,
"I'm so efficient when I use it. The Wear integration needs additional options, 5.1 opened up many possibilities for the app that they haven't taken advantage of.... yet",
easy to add items. setting up repeat tasks a bit clunky. wish tasks would automatically sort by due date,
"Has really helped me improve my organization. I use it in conjunction with a field notes notebook 📓 which I take notes in first, I then transfer items I don't complete immediately into todoist. Works great!",
I am using ToDoIst for 2 years. I can not imagin a work week without this app. Simple and done. I do not need premium but I pay for it because i want to support ToDoIst team.,
Using Todoist for 2 months. It is simply the best and smartest life organizing tool I have. It needs improvement in making sublists.,
"I paid £18 for an annual premium sub and then  the sync stopped working on my Nexus 9.   Also, it will not work on my ubiquitous iPhone 4. None of these caveats are in the sales docs.  This product is not market ready. I would like a refund!!",
"I discovered the full power of Todoist after reading a book by Daniel LeFebvre ""Getting Things Done With Todoist"".",
This to do list app is simply perfect. I can quickly add reminders and tasks. I have tried many other apps that fall short.,
"Lots of useful features, especially like the natural language input and that it syncs between devices. So good I might go nuts and pay for premium.",
"What I like about this all app is that if you want a simple To do list, this does it. If you're hyper organized it allows you to do all sorts of customization. It's great.",
Todoist has become my primary task app. The integration with so many different apps has made this indispensable for my workflow.,
ToDoist has been my go to for breaking down mountains of tasks into manageable daily agendas.,
Like the connectivity with all my devices including my 2 Windows 10 OC's app works great,
"It does everything I want.  It is light, flexible and available anywhere.  It takes a few too many taps to do things for my liking but its on par with Wunderlist.  Logo could use updating.",
"Am also a big fan of Doit, but this is so streamlined and intuitive, as well as beautiful. Best around.",
This app has made everyday task & Event seamless for me. l work from any device and my bf has been very easy .,
"Loved this app before the upgrade! 2 PROBLEMS: lt's virtually IMPOSSIBLE to MOVE a task by holding down on a task, as the screen moves at the speed of LIGHT! My screen scrolls CONSTANTLY!!! I click on ONE thing & the screen takes off to Tomorrow or somewhere!!! STOP THE WORLD! I JUST WANT TO READ IT! Also, if I forget to swipe a completed recurring DAILY task until the next day, it jumps OVER the current day to ""Tomorrow!"" PLEASE FIX!!!",
"Truly enables a productivity style that works with people of all shapes, sizes, and lifestyles. Love it.",
"Material design looks great, intelligent quick add is a disaster. This app used to be a five for me, now I'm looking for other options. I hope the developers listen to their many premium users who hate this feature and provide the option to turn it off.",
The postponement of tasks still removes the repeat variations after multiple postponements. This is an annoying feature and I'm considering moving because I'm continuously having to reset the repeat on all my tasks that lose the value.,
"Hate that it wouldn't stop asking me to rate it every time I opened the damned thing, though.",
"Dragging items constantly causes the app to crash, adding new tasks is slower, the design increases font size and adds garish colors without improving usability. It was a great app, now it's just ok. The replies from the staff appear to be deaf to the resounding feedback from users, instead trying to convince us that we're wrong and that it's better. It's not! I know it's a lot of work to make an app and it's hard hearing negative feedback, but you already were doing a great job... Get back on that track.",
Keeps my to do lists organized. I am sure it could be tweeked to streamline it more but it has been really helpful for me.,
"would get a five, but due to need for upgrade purchase,I have it a 4.",
"Found some bugs, hope they will be fixed soon. But in general very useful to-do list.",
Just started using the Todoist app and so far so good. Does everything I need a reminder app to do and links all my tech so I can get to all the things I need to do within a touch or click.,
Need I say more. A productivity app that doesn't get in the way of being productive,
Been using for 6 months and love it. Little by little I'm using more of its features. It has really gotten me into a productive habit. I think it can even help you figure out your priorities over time.,
Great app for busy people with a lot of stuff to keep track of. Yearly subscription a bit too pricey so I'm sticking with free version for now,
"The website functionality that needed to be captured here is fairly well done. Can't replace the website for ""throughput""but is a good second choice for ubiquitous capture",
"The best thing about this app is the ability to add a new task from the notification bar without opening the app.  The worst thing is the widget, it's not very good looking, too much white space between each item.   When widget is improved would give 5 stars.",
"Simple interface. Easy to make posts, due dates, and the feel-good of clearing them with a swipe.",
I've been using it a few days so far and I like it. Helps keep me to task and I needed that. Would have given it 5 stars if in the free version you could set alerts. Alerts come with your free calendar so I would have thought it would have been a free add on.,
"This app replaced my 5 year old routine of tracking my to do's using a day timer. Very happy with this app, easy to add new tasks on the fly.  It would be nice to see a more full featured Windows client for when I'm at my desk",
"For some reason my offer from Huawei of a free year of premium has not been activated, and would like to hear back on this. Have also emailed about this",
Cross-platform support is the best part of this app. The ability to add & update entries on multiple devices is a huge advantage.,
"Wheb adding a task, it automatically goes to the bottom of the list and you don't have the option in the settings to change that. Premium account/app is too expensive.",
"Nice to do app, I'd remove the default emails sent to the user, user can activate them if needed but by default is kind on annoying",
It will be very good if I can see the list of tasks that I completed. Its premium version. Please make it free. Thanks.,
I like the new look.  One thing that I would find handy is the abilty to set the project for a task when inputting the text in the same way as you can add @tags and p:priorities.,
"It has everything I need in a ""to do"" app, and so little extra that it remains simple and there's almost no wasted time or screen space",
"Easily the best to do list app I've encountered. Wunderlist was good, but this is better! Using it in synchronization with Sunrise Calendar and Evernote complete the trifecta of productivity and organization!",
This has become a critical part of my effort to stay organized. So much so that it was easily with it to purchase the Premium option.,
I am a premium subscriber.  Sync has completely failed across platforms. Desperately trying to save task data. And support could be do much more helpful.,
I've been looking for a decent app for organizing tasks for a while now and I think I finally found the one we did it kids.,
Used the free version. Can easily sort task based on projects and easily sync between computer and mobile. Reminder option is good along with daily task email in your inbox. Great productivity tool. Highly recommended.,
"Had trouble installing update, but it finally went. I like that I  send a section of tasks to wearable.",
"Switched from Don't Forget The Milk.  Find Todoist easier to use and therefore more effective.  Of course like all organizers, you have to commit to making the time to use it.",
I absolutely love this app except for one major flaw. Paying for the premium version 4x just so 4 people can get reminders...not cool. I would gladly pay $30 a year for my group to collaborate on projects but not per person. Regretfully uninstalling.,
You've improved this perfectly decent application to the point where it is perfectly unstable and unusable. Losing a 2 year user.,
I'm still only using the free version and it has come in handy at work and in life. I'm thinking of doing that upgrade and letting this app be my go-to for keeping me organized.,
Better than other ones I've used like wunderlist. I would give it 5 if better reminder features were included.,
Best I've used for basic to-do list. Only used a few months but already seen some nice user improvements as well.,
Just waiting for the location reminders to be fixed. But I like that I can just write the info straight into the box including start and end dates and priority and labels.,
The minimal design here is key this makes the experience superb. Material design through and through and you've got yourself a winner. Love the way that I can manage different projects (lists) and each can be give their own unique color. Pairs very well with the web counterpart.,
"It's one of those apps that you wonder how you lived without it. It's as useful as you want it to be. With evernote app there to remember everything, todoist gets my tasks under control and actionable, plus it can feel like a game with their karma points.",
"The old Todoist was good but the new version is even better. I don't need to revert to the web version as often as I used to as it's easy to use, even on a small screen.",
"Great app, easy to add and manage tasks. Please add a ""Due this week"" feature, so that a task can be quickly added to be done by the end of the week.",
This is the first app where after a week I've still been able to do everything I've wanted. Free version is fine but this is good enough to pay for. The fact that this works with IFTTT is a plus.,
My only complaint would be that even after paying for a sub the app has a popup asking for a review.,
"I like the way it integrates with other services. A little clunky to add tasks on mobile, and it isn't quite as pretty as wunderlist, but it is more functional for me.",
"Free version has great features for users. Interface is very fast on my phone, tablet, and computer. No bugs no laging. Users can create their own projects. Goals can be sorted via project and organized underneath another goal, like a sub-goal. Very pleased with this app. Might go for the unlimited paid version.",
"Especially the add task feature, I can understand why you think you upgraded it, but seeing other people's comments also, it's not as user friendly as before. Why change what was so good already? :(  also, there is no flexibility anymore with writing dates and numbers!!!",
"It would to totally perfect of you have a standalone app for Linux system.        Bug: Sync issues with Firefox on Linux, getting multiple deletions..",
"I appreciate the simplicity of  Todoist. An App that links tasks to email & contacts would be ideal, a 5 star.",
Switched from Wunderlist and couldn't be happier after three weeks of use.,
Like the reminders.visually is not very appealing hut quite basic but does the job,
Unsure if it's a premium only thing but I'll be darned if I could find how to make a task repeat. For me that's a core requirement and so I think I'll be passing.,
Why would you make adding tasks more complex! Please go back to old format.  I just reduced you from a 5 star to 3. Disappointed!,
"I use it for everything. I have a free subscription and it is all I need. The team at doist is great, and very responsive. If you want to start being productive, download it and follow the ivy method. If you need more complexity, you can always move to a  paid subscription.",
I have many projects and they always have more dependent tasks I had not found any application where I could do that until now.,
I like the calendar/reminder function. However the subtasks don't always show up when using an android phone.,
This has been a really great tool to keep me on task and to stay organized. I'd recommend it to all,
"That being said, there are minor things lacking ie. .. inserting a check list. ..if I want to create a list,  this thing takes forever.",
"Reminders seem to be more reliable now. Bit of a clunky task input and no way to disable Wear support, so it leaves a background Wear process running if you use it or not.",
"Great interface,  some features are not intuitive",
Nice and simple....fun to look at karma trend as an interesting way to stay committed to time management. I've incorporated as my main tool for life management. Todism!,
This little app is exactly what I wanted. You can add tasks to your to do list that can be color coded. You can also adjust importance and add sub tasks for an item or built projects. I've been using this constantly since I installed it. Love it!,
I installed this app a few days ago after trying others. It was with an article that I read that compared it to other apps that helped make my decision to pay for the upgrade. So far so good....,
Recommended for people with memory issues or problems remembering times and dates.,
"I've had some issues with other platforms, but the Android app is solid. Combined with the availability of apps and plugins elsewhere, thus is becoming an indispensible tool for me.",
"I am somewhat of a productivity geek and have used a number of tools from Asana to Trello, Wunderlist to Toodledo. But I must say I have taken a liking to Todoist. It's a smart app that works really well. Simple yet Elegant, works great on all platforms.",
"After an exhaustive  search, I am happy to say I've finally settled on Todoist to manage my day-to-day tasks. Attractive interface, useful features, and a motivating system involving a level hierarchy and ""karma"" points gained by completing tasks. Give it a shot!",
I like the material design makeover. My only gripe is the way it automatically fills in dates when you type any number into a task. Very annoying.,
I really do not like new interface. Old was perfect now it is difficult to use.,
"Become myy default app for to-do list, after trying all major apps available. Pricing for premium version is competitive but can be little cheaper.",
Tried them all. This has all the features I need and looks good. Evernote and calendar sync really help organise my life.,
"I've tried a lot of different task management tools, and Todoist nails it for me. Integrated with Gmail, available on any platform, GTD support, powerful filters, and a great UI. I've only been using it for a month and am looking forward to exploring even more advanced features.",
"Good, responsive support  team makes it more than just another to do application. I loved it. Features are added often and evolving continuously.",
"Great app. My husband and I love that we can since our to-do lists, it's much easier than making a calendar invite or sending an email!",
"I use a desktop, ipad, and Galaxy s6. Todoist has seamless coverage fir these devices and I enjoy using it. I would like to see finger print list encryption and more security.",
I haven't used it enough to really understand all the features but it looks promising,
Very well made todo list app. Specially with the premium features together with all the various places of integration I feel like I have found a perfect tool for organising my daily life.,
"Basic necessary functions are available in free mode, but you have to subscribe to get alarms (though can set due date/time nonetheless) and task notes & attachments (otherwise can only use task name to describe your task).",
"Now when I type a number it automatically gets converted to a date. So if I add 9 carrots to my shopping list, I can't. This is ridiculous. Uninstalling.",
If want to add task to say book appointment for hairdresser on 8th August it adds task puts in that date -help!,
This is by far the best app I've tried.  It let's me apply the Franklin Covey methodology (I use projects as roles). I ended up upgrading as I think it's totally worth it especially considering it's multiplatform.,
Best task manager available. When coupled with a desktop email client this is extremely powerful. The UI experience is pretty top notch too. I still have to figure out how to batch move tasks I didn't complete to the next day but I'm sure I'll figure it out. Great job.,
"Fantastic, not only will this app help you organise your daily tasks but the multi platform ability helps you enter tasks no matter where you are",
Keeps me organized and on task. Can be customized very easily. I like that there is granular notification control. Sync between devices is flawless.,
It is one of the best to do list apps out there. Easy to use with clean design and useful widget. I gave 4 stars because I wish it had a field for effort estimate and actual effort so I could track my time.,
This app has allowed me to organise my life better through my phone and laptop. Great all round app,
"I've tried a lot of different To Do apps and this is definitely the most feature packed, flexible and usable. Great for work tasks and personal use, while the shared projects makes it easy to use with the family. The free version is very limited, you do need to pay (use the free trial) to see the full benefits.",
A no-bs app which gets my work done. Have been using it for a while now.,
Seriously. I hate the new quick add ui.,
"I use it at the office, share lists with my coworkers, girlfriend, clients. It's great - keeps me in sync with what needs done.",
Amazing app. Seriously. I love the whole karma thing :),
"Possibly the best, the only problem i have is with syncing. FAQ isn't that much of a help either.",
The best task and project management tool I've tried. Very minimalistic by design and very functional. Love the location-based reminders.,
"Old design was much better then the new one, I hope you'll bring it back. Overall, usefull app.",
"One list across Android and Mac, phone, tablet and desktop. Nice visuals and straightforward design. Integrates well with OS X notification center.",
"I've tried a lot of different apps to organize my To-dos, but this is by far the best one and it continues to get better.  I am looking forward to new integrations courtesy of the new PowerApp API.",
I love the functionality in this! It helps my forgetfulness and is easy to use.,
"UI is clean, simple and easy to use, which is a good thing in any productivity app",
I paid for the upgrade and now have a firm grip on the wheel. I finally feel like I am getting things under control.,
"As a Linux user I really appreciate support for Thunderbird client. This works in every platform I need. However, I'd like to decide where my data is kept. With this app it's always in the cloud. Company cloud or personal cloud aren't possible.",
"I like being able to sync across platforms, keep track of sub steps as well as the main projects, and use the inbox as the first step of Tim Allen's gtd method.",
"I've tried many, many to do list apps over the years. This is the first to allow me to see my list across all of my devices, has plugins for gmail and outlook and is so easy to use. I highly recommend it and am so glad I found it!",
This app really helps when one becomes forgetful.,
This app is so helpful at tracking projects and getting them done i wish I'd had it 20 years ago! Recommended!,
"this is my 5th app and i like it. it is simple, easy to use (lean but powerful interface) and has enough functionality to be a serious tool",
The layout is great. It's easy to navigate through. It's become an every day tool for me.,
"I have been trying to use various to-do list apps, but Todoist is the first one that worked for me. I like the ease of use, the layout, and the integration into Outlook.",
This is an amazing app! Just wish it was a bit easier to create and edit tasks. Love the Google app integration as well. Best To do list I have used so far,
"The new desing made everything harder to use — You need to create a task and then go and edit it to set its project — The same goes for adding a date, you need to create and then edit it — Adding time is a chaos by itself, you got to create a task, edit its date, click the option to ""Pick date and time"", pick a date and then add the time. It's annoying because sometimes I've already prostponed the task and then I have to pick the same date again because that's the only way to add a time to it.",
Good way to manage tasks ...can both use it for simple task management  also for a detialed task management,
"New design is cool. But I really wish that there is 'Everyday' or range date option for due date. Because sometimes I have a task that need to be done day by day not only 1 day. Other than it, it's cool!",
"I know it could be a great app, but either the description of how to use it is not very clear or it is not friendly enuf for the beginner.  I think I hve to play around more with the app and really get to know it. But does everyone have the time ?? Also, I would have liked to hve it in my (S3) multi-window menu",
Great app. Useful. I found it better than the alternatives.  I would love if the developer add dark theme in the widget.,
Simple tool with solid background stuff - really useful in keeping me productive - highly recommended,
I love how it helps me keep organized. My only wish is that it could ring and alarm as well.,
"Silly, buggy interface, also annoying.",
"Really enjoy using this app. Clean interface, simple flow. Nice integration for Gmail. Quite basic for team collaboration purposes, better suited for personal tasks. Now my go to to-do tool.",
It has allowed me to take advantage of all of that wasted stand around time and be more productive.,
Reoccurring tasks work great.  Free app is awesome,
Over 300 standing clients with as many as 5 projects simultaneously. Tourist is performing the function of 3 employees.,
"After trying this out for a few days, I went premium! This is a great application, and it keeps me on task both at work and at home. Go ahead and try the free version. You won't regret it!",
Appli bien pratique et réactive. L'idée du karma est bien faite! Motorola Droid 4,
It's a really nice app to increase your productivity! It's made my life easy for me to manage my daily tasks. The new material design makes it even more user friendly and beautiful.,
I love the recurring day function.,
I just love ToDoist - I couldn't get by without it in my professional life (as a lawyer) or in my personal life.,
I like that this app can be as simple or complex as you like.  Great for recurring lists.,
I'm not a time management geek. But this service helps me every day. Thank you!,
"It might feel to complex at first but once you get the hang of it, it works great.",
Can keep up with anything that comes up when u on the road and not at the office,
Can't live without it now. Pay for the upgraded features of you need them.,
I have tried a couple of apps and so far this one has been the best for my needs.,
really helped manage chaotic life. Try it for yourselves.,
"The latest upgrade made the app much less user-friendly, and harder to use quickly!",
"Did not work the way I wanted, ask for purchase",
"I love this app, I think it is the best. But the new version has some problems that need to be fixed as soon as possible.  when I write any number it automatically become yellow,  and become a date. it is terrible!!! please take of this",
I have someone problem with organization... Now I can do everything in order!,
Feeling more organized and getting more done than I have in a long time!,
Works great.   I'm pleased.  But would be nice if they had a monthly Premium Plan.,
Really good app. Does everything you need and the cross platform allows for great efficency,
Timesaving organiser - so easy to use - and I'm on android - i use it across all my media - 3 years - no problems,
Being able to add deadlines to each task &  reminder email are some of the many fantastic features of this app.,
I love it. It really helps me remember my tasks for the day and even gives statements that I can do after completing all 😊😊 keep up the good work~~!,
Uninstalling. Such a great app and not transparent widget.,
"Very simple and powerful app, finally got me using a todo-list app.",
"Takes far too long to create tasks now! Previous version had a zero thought, quick fire way of adding tasks....Now we have to manipulate bells, whistles & complications to achieve a simple task creation....Your old app was PERFECT and clutter free....now it's just another bloated todo list....quickly change...or we will....such a shame, hopefully you'll listen.PLEASE...UPDATE..Thanks for the stock reply...As most users are trying to tell you, it used to be much simpler to quickly add a task...LISTEN please",
Very easy to use. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a simple cross platform task management app.,
I've used several different apps on multiple platforms and this is the best I've seen.,
"Personal android, work mac, and home on windows/web. Works great. Syncs great. Love it.",
Very nice app bcz it sets our goals and to achieve them within mentioned time.,
The new material design is fantastic.,
"excellent app, suits my needs at present",
It's not all that intuitive but it's useful,
I use this in conjunction with Evernote and TaskClone. It is vital to my daily success!,
"""Discovering"" Todoist, I live easier, not worying about remembering things... Everything is here, accessible everywhere (Android, iPhone, desktop and more), helps keeping my mailboxes (both business and personal) empty!",
"Best cross-platform, composite device action manager application on the market.",
"My goto task manager, made even better with the update.",
Excellent  it also helps me in taking out my note and also do my #todolist,
I thought it was pretty good until they did an update...then it was worse. Go figure.,
This app keeps getting better. Easy and simple to use and the Material Design is flawless.,
"My favorite app - works wonders. Easy to use and cross-platform, integrated with gmail. It's awesome, really helps me get work done.",
"I have used about every major task list app out there - Astrid, Wunderlist, TickTick, Remember The Milk, and more... This is the only one that works really well for managing a wide range of lists and projects, while still remaining easy to use. Plus, its extraordinary multiple platform support lets me use it from my phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop seamlessly. Todoist and Outlook run my life!",
"Still working out how to use!  So far so good,",
It does a fantastic job of solving my todo problem,
"Been using Todoist for many years, now on Android too.",
Very useful for multiple tasks and great that you can colloborate and share projects.,
I find this simpler to use than Wunderlist-- and that is awesome!! Also just typing in my due date (tomorrow@9am) and it being set with out anything extra is a plus for me;o),
Simple to use.  Love the reminders!,
Premium is the only way to go. Very smart!,
"I like app design and functionality. But, how much it will help me organize my life for a long period?!",
Robust app.  Keep up the good work!,
Sorted my year 12 life out. Thank you!,
"Superb task app. Simple, and I actually use it",
"This is a fantastic app. I'm really impressed with all the Todoist apps that I've used so far. I find the design very clear and minimal. It feels very fast and responsive, especially compared to some other competing apps that I've used. The (premium) app has pretty much all the features I could want, although I would really like to see some kind of ""next action"" functionality if they're going to claim the usefulness of the app for GTD. As a developer I'm excited that Todoist offer a web API for their app, which makes it possible to write your own scripts and applications that plugin to Todoist. I'm looking forward to see what updates the Doist team have in store :) hint: maybe a vim plugin :P",
This app does exactly what i says it will do.  I highly recommend it,
Super well done todo app. Easy to use and helpful!,
Hating the latest update :-(,
Was helpful for me in helping me keep track of my daily to-do list. Thanks to the developer!,
App works as designed for me. Easy to add a task and review. Thanks.,

Awsome app helped me alot keeping me up to the uni stuff,
Just what I usually use from the full web version. Notifications are convenient.,
Helps me so much with productivity! Typing the due date is amazing and it understands everytime!,
"Love it, but older version was better and easy to use.",
Makes every day the best day ever! Thank you Team ToDoist,
It's a very good app which helps you organize your day.,
Navigation can be non-intuitive...A great planner/at a glance nonetheless.,
Love it! Would buy the paid version had it not been so expensive,
"All my lists in one place, no more papers. Love it!",
"It does what is advertised, wish it was easier to add detailed tasks.",
It's an extremely nice compliment to the GTD and Bullet Journal methods.,
The project portion is just great. Tried it and got the upgrade.,
"One of the greatest app on playstore., thank you.",
Contain all the most things which require to sort & make a list.....worthfull,

Simple but tons of functionality for free version. Successfully using it for GTD methodology. Love it,
Actually have no issues whatsoever...  Good download.,
"Good app, with reliable sync and decent interface (far from pretty but it works). Now how dare you guys make such a standard feature as reminders be a premium one?",
And it seems like I've used 'em all.,
I have tried other apps but always return to Todoist.,
"Very easy to use and very useful, especially the quick input action.",
"Really helps me be organised, love it and would highly recommend",
Would be better if it was easier to add new items.,
"Great app, it helps to get organised and keep projects moving smooth and fast",

"Does what it says, I have to play some more with it",
"Looks so simple, but has powerful features!",
This apps is very useful for me to be organised.,

Completely useless without Google Calendar sync,
Solid task app. It does everything I need it to,
Please make real task templates!,

So far my favorite to do ap!,

Very good way to keep track of tasks,
Needs some tweaking but overall pretty good,
made my life easier.,
The app is good but free version is really very limited and of no use..  It even doesn't allow to add a remainder to your task. You should learn something from other applications....😔😔😔😔😔😔,
Been something that was  simple to use on all systems and allows me to create projects and context this is what I was looking for,
I like the concept of awarding points for task completion.... Kinda motivates me....,
Excellence application. Good for tracking your day to day task,
This app is good for creating a task list.,
"Nice app, using this one right now",
Free version worked well for me.,

"Дизайн конечно обновили, все очень здорово, но фишки с автоматическим преобразованием текста в параметры при вводе очень странные - хочу ввести слово, а оно автоматически меняет его на какой-то параметр и сохраняет не известно куда. Интуитивно это не понятно. Приходится избегать заменяемых слов..иначе не поставить задачу(((",
I really want to move over from wunderlist and thought the redesign might win me over.   I'm held back by the needles clicks to edit and change priority for example. I would love to see someone use pinch to zoom to expand and collapse folders to make navigation faster too.,
"It was so simple and perfect...now every task with a number requires another step to not automatically treat it as a date, project list collapses, suggested tasks are a distraction....will start looking for replacement without an option to revert or turn off some of these ""features"".",
I've been using it for a while now and I really like it. I like the features and really like the new UI. I would like to see an easier way to set up recurring tasks and alarms and the ability to choose a specific time to snooze a task reminder.,
"Love it! Feels weird when each number thinks I'm entering a date, but I'm sure the dev team is working on this.",
"Very useful and sleek, and I love the fact that this has plugins on Gmail and Firefox. Love it! 😊",
"After the last update, the app is once again, the best one out!",
"Can anyone else get this to work properly? I cannot edit Todoist tasks in GCal, including their dates. And, they are syncing to my phone days behind the GCal entries I make on my laptop.",
This is hands down the best productivity app that I have ever used.,
"TODOIST, love the update EXCEPT for the changes to adding tasks. It takes longer to add tasks now. This is a huge pain point. The old interface focused on speed and use, the new one focuses on it being pretty. Everything is way to spread out when your adding a task. If you don't decide to change it back, then give the option to switch between material and old style.",
"I don't mind the distracting colors, though I think the simpler color scheme from before was more befitting a productivity app.  What has killed it is the 4 straight force closes I've had since the update.  EDIT TO ADD: Force close happened after sweeping right on tasks to check them off.",
"I feel like I need a new tutorial after the update which was not fun to find out on the fly when I don't have time to figure it out all over again!   I love that it integrates on all my devices and sends email reminders. I really wish there were widget options though. 4x3 is huge. 4x2 would be fine or other smaller options that would fit on my phone pages better. If it had that, it would get 5 stars.",
I downloaded this app today after reading an article and I was not disappointed at all! Great design and it uses material design SO well. The only thing is that I think the price for a year subscription is a bit too much. If it was maybe like a one payment thing  I would totally buy this. Anyways still 5 stars. Keep up the awesome work!,
"I'm ridiculously picky about to do apps and I've tried scores over the years. I want it all: GTD-capable, flexible, fast, easy to use, but with plenty of customization, granular control and a wicked smooth workflow. Todoist delivers. The premium version shines and is one of the few out there actually worth the price.The latest update raises the bar by making task entry lightning fast with RTM-style quick syntax. No fiddling with a half dozen fields, just type as many task properties as you like.",
"The latest update moved all of my task forward a day and will not let me add new task to Today or change existing task to Today.  NEW PROBLEM: Release 8.0.1 fixed the problem with Task having been moved forward a day but now nearly all of my Projects are not listed on the Android app. They're still on the web, Chrome and Outlook, but not on my phone. Again, BAD UPDATE!!. This is not what I expected for $29. per year. Everything worked just fine before this update.",
"A few weeks ago I would have given this app 5 plus stars, but I hate the changes they made to the way you add tasks. I'll keep using it hoping they fix this mistake, at least until I find something that is as good and as easy as this used to be.",
"Update: love the redesign. It has some bugs, but it's efficient, well designed, and still an integral part of my war to get things done. This is the first ToDo style system I've been willing to spend money on. It has Google Calendar integration, projects, tagging, reminders, and more. It was well worth $2.50 month to support the creators.",
"Samsung Galaxy S4: Your ADD TASK on the LOCK SCREEN covers up my PERSONAL MESSAGE (which has no option but to appear at the top of the screen). I have always set my PM to display my contact info, if my phone's lost. I see no way to remove ADD TASK from LOCK SCREEN. It's unnecessary there for me anyway; ADD TASK is quickly available from the pull down NOTIFICATIONS BAR. At a minimum, please create a setting to relocate it's placement. Please advise. (Great little app. Annual fee is too expensive for me.)",
Like some aspects of the new design but too much wasted space I want to see as many tasks as possible without scrolling the old layout was superior in that regard. The website interface suffers from the same affliction. When managing large number of tasks a birds eye view is needed.,
"The best todo app I've had, way better than Wunderlist (more features, less expensive, better interface, more logical, etc.). Also, WL is missing some key features around flexible repeating events and reminds which Todoist does perfectly. Support is pretty spectacular - I've gotten replies within half an hour on weekends. Can't go wrong!",
One of the best things about this app was the widget. But it functions worse after this new update. Especially bothersome is the huge padding. I want to be able to fit more than a couple of tasks in my widget without having to look at all this empty space.,
"Going the way of Wunderlist! - trying to win design awards rather than actually providing a functional app.  I want to be able to add tasks easily. Not learn a DSL to add times and dates...  I used to be able to set reminders and dates from the add task button - now I have to enter stuff like ""Task name at 9pm"" - which will create a task (no reminder) for the next 9pm occurrence. There's probably some command i can type in to get it to do what I want, but seriously... this is a step backwards.  If i have a task, with subtasks, since the update, these don't expand.  If it aint broke, don't fix it. I sincerely wish I hadn't updated!",
There is no other app that is as truly cross platform as Todoist. It's well designed and miles better than the competition.,
"It is a great tool to get things done especially because it is available for pretty much anything. The Material-version is very pretty. Why only 4 stars? For one it has themes but no real dark theme. In each theme most visible fields are still white. And it still doesn't have real start dates, so that tasks can be hidden until a certain date. When I can do something starting Saturday, I do not need to see it before.",
"But the update changed it to the standard Google/Android app look, with bright colors and big fonts. I really liked the simple look, especially the quick add widget/shortcut which I used often. That took up a very minimalist portion of the screen. Now, the whole screen is used up when doing the exact same thing. The purpose?",
As a manager for a large company I use this program religiously for my time management. Unfortunately there seems to be some issues with sub-tasks loading very slow. Besides this I like the update.,
The only thing i noticed was that material design hasn't fully met the widgets. Other than that everything works fine now.,
"The web Browser Version works great, unfortunately In the app creating proper nesting is near impossible and  nothing stays nested correctly. Simply checking that you completed something will unnest tasks if done in the wrong order. In addition the app is very bad at pulling dates out of titles, so much so that the function should not be included in the app. For instance typing something like ""sit ups 50 reps x 2""  will result in the app trying to pull 50 or 2 into the due date over and over again.",
I really do love this application. But after the material design update I cannot display my sub-lists. It also isn't syncing correctly.  Website works great though.,
New method is not more efficient. No reminders without upgrade? Really? People won't upgrade if there isn't something in the free version to get us hooked. And ur preset labels...did u intentionally make most of them so awkward to force us to upgrade? Used you since beginning. Looking elsewhere. Maybe after I've found a simple to-do w reminders and sync I'll come come learn ur version of efficiency. Didn't have time for surprise today.,
Really good looking update to material design. Not quite as user friendly as before but I can get used to it.,
Crashes after update to MD on zenfone 5 (4.4 kitkat) device. Bad testing before deploying new releases.,
Not that easy to add tasks as before redesign. Using text input is not that convenient on the go. Number of taps and waiting for animations for add/edit task dialogs increased. UI elements on those screens are far from each other what makes your finger travel a lot around screen. Downgraded to 7.1.4.,
Got irritated that the premium tabs cannot be removed. Hate clicking on labels accidentally and getting the premium notice.,
I use it daily in Personal and Work life. Helps me in keep Office schedules and Priorities always on track. Never been easier and smooth. Keep up the Awesome Job. Cheers.,
I chose to use the old Todoist because of its simplicity. The new UI makes me take longer to create tasks and looks far less clean. I'll be looking for a replacement.,
"Update was okay cosmetically, but the entry change is terrible. You may think it is easier than ever but in reality you have ruined this app by fixing what wasn't broken. Please, for the love of humanity let us get the old version of entry back.",
The new design looks great and I would probably use it but the fact that you have to pay to have basic functions such as a reminder is pretty dumb. I'm not sure that many people  will use it because of that.,
"I didn't like new version , I was comfortable with old version.. In new version you can add tasks easily for today. But it takes to much time to add tasks on specific date .. Provide us old version.  So it will be easy to access.",
"I've only had it installed for a short time, but Todoist has proven to be the most effective and efficient way to keep track of every. little. thing. that comes my way.",
"Keep the look,  but the old way of adding tasks.  I don't like the 2 steps to picking a time and date, let's just make that go directly into the yellow page with options.  In other words, if I slide left, go straight to the yellow page",
"Lowering my review for the new version. I loved the old version for how clean and simple it was. All that has been thrown out the window in the update. Too bad, Todoist used to be my favorite app.",
"The new material interface is pretty, I'll give you that. It's also pretty useless.  Why would anyone want to type ""tomorrow"" instead of just clicking an icon? And if you want to provide that option, why delete the icon too? And the new UI makes it difficult to set project category--I can't figure out how to do that while creating the to-do, even after watching the ridiculous video on their website (so much WOW!). Apparently you have to do that after first creating the task.  UPDATE: reading a response from Todoist to another disappointed reviewer, I learn that you're supposed to type out the name of the project too. So much typing. How innovative and convenient! So now I need to type something like ""Check Kathy's binder due today, a ""ASU misc"" label""? What a pain in the butt!",
"Tried several To-do app, but this seems to best so far. Updated to 5 star after new update.",
"I'd give it a 5 stars if it lets users set their own default reminders instead of a ""30 minutes before"" reminder every time. Edit: after the last update I can now do that. The developers did listen to the users and implemented what they want. I am very pleased.",
Like sub project or sub task listing is taking an awful lot of time (5 to 10 seconds). Never experienced this before.,
Great new design and very easy to use across all platforms. I'm obsessed with my Karma.,
It's more complex than ticktick but once you get over that slight hurdle it is a little better for power users and feels more solid as an app and a company.,
The original update today had a glitch but the developers responded quickly as normal and now we have an excellent update. Rock On with the best To Do App on the market!,
"... And lightening quick sync across all my PCs and devices. Latest update is good, not sure why other reviewers are finding it difficult to add a task, i have no issues with it, but it was pretty good before the update",
"Using this more and more. Started using it for own tasks at work. Now using it for personal reminders, organising teamwork and keeping tabs on projects. Love the integration with Outlook too. Sync between various devices is seamless. This is a keeper.",
"Just an opinion, I think it would be great to have at least some trial period to experience the premium. I find the app crippled when there's no reminder feature. At least allow a number of Todo items to have the reminder option.",
The material design interface is stunning! The no bells and whistles design makes it great for anyone who is just keen on getting stuff done.,
I like the way you can send to do lists and get others involved. It is basic unless you pay  for e one with whistles on. I would like to see either one of price or cheaper yearly fee. Then I would buy the more comprehensive version. In all the basic one is good,
Had a little difficulty making the reminders work the way I wanted but hopefullu I have it figured out now :) Great features.,
I love it!! Love the different categories you can color and helps keep track of everything that I need to get done.,
Great todo management app. Some learning curve but not too bad. Would like to see easier input of sub tasks. Maybe I just need to work with the new interface a bit more. Looks great. Works great.,
Dependencies were requested by users a long time ago. Still missing. What a pity.,
It appears this was redesigned for speech control input with no regard for how this affects normal input. It looks like an update done by the geeks without input from users. I am looking for a different app.,
"I love this app, but the newest update makes it so much harder to add tasks. I'm going to be spending more time typing things in than actually accomplishing anything. Completely counterintuitive.",
With the new interface I can't see how you add sub tasks to the same main task easily? Otherwise great app. I don't have a problem with the new way to add tasks.,
Todoist is great with the preamium features. But 30 dollars a year is far too expensive.,
"ToDoist is a great cross-platform todo list service (syncing is fast and flawless between my Mac, iPad and Android device).   With this release, the Android client becomes the pick of the Todoist bunch. Interactions are well designed, everything is a tap or two away. It's also very pretty, which doesn't hurt.   Highly recommended.",
Update had a bug problem. I post a review explaining my disappointment. 15 minutes later the developer responds to my review. A couple hours after that a new update and no more problem. What's not to like! Awesome job you guys!!!! Thank you:),
"This new version is total CRAP! Not only does it look dog poo, it no longer allows adding new items. At least not by pasting from the clipboard. How do I go back to the excellent app you used to have???  DON'T DL THIS VESION OR YOU'RE SCREWED !!!",
Download it now. It's easy and not annoying!,
Minor complaint is that there is too much space wastage with the widget. Even when it is 4x4. Please make it more compact. I think this problem got worse with the material update.,
"Great app, well layed out UI, works on every platform, once you have plan the structure no going back you will love it! The next day I purchased the premium version.",
Switching between projects is a nightmare.,
"everything is very nice. but i think push notifications should be made available for free. Else what is the point of having a to-do list manager which cannot notify.               Update2: The new material design theme is very nice and pleasing. It was always a wonderful app to use and is the same even today. I use the todoist on my phone, chrome browser,  outlook messenger seamlessly without missing out on anything important.",
FAB button in material design release has stopped the crashes in android m preview.,
"The updated design certainly looks better, however the old menu for adding tasks was far better. Typing out everything is far more work than simply tapping a date. So please add that back in.",
Reminders disappear from notification bar instantly without me interacting with them. I miss all of my reminders,
"Love the new look! And the small bug I had at first has already been fixed. Impressive work, Todoist team!",
Great app for managing your day to day tasks. Wud love to have sub task feature in Free edition.,
"Appreciate the support, updates and all the love coming from Todoist! Please continue to bring premier customer support to this top tier app",
A bit confusing. I still sort of like it... Can someone explain how to add my tasks to a project quickly? It defaults to the inbox and doesn't seem to go to my project when I type the project name.,
"Took a minute to learn,  some seemed awkward at first,  love it now...",
"Does not synchronize with Google Calendar. This is Android, so most people use Google Calendar. Missed opportunity, great design!",
"Godd design, easy and organized. A good fit!",
Looks terrible with the orange juice backdrop! Scrolling through tasks and editing tasks is awkward and inefficient. Bring back the old version or loose me to GT tasks,
"Update. The new design... a bit confusing. And what's with the sugestions like Pick Andy at 5. Please downgrade. Or please let us choose between versions. This time 3 stars. --------------------------------------- Best todo app! Integrates with email and notifies you in time, even place. Love the function of setting emails as tasks. I use Postpox in my computer as email client and CloudMagic on my phone. They both work as charm with Todoist.",
Material Design simply made me redownload this app and give it a second try.  Material widget would be awesome.,
task surching not work proprly.,
"I love the new interface, and it makes using this app so much easier!",
LAST UPDATE BREAKS THE APP,
I would love to have the remainder on the free version.,
Easy to use and an excellent tool for life and work.,
You used to be able to add a task right into the project you wanted it to go in now you have to add task and then edit it or select the project first....just seems like an extra step now....really annoying,
Is this communist China? Can we please change the colors in the header? Looks utterly horrible. -3 stars for that :(,
Just recently started using it. So far so good.,
Would be good if you could alter the transparency of the widget.,
Yes even better than wunderlist.,
Works well. Pleasant to use. Any number of subtask level.,
"Simple to use, does everything I need.",
"So far, it's covers all my needs",
Useless for keeping simple lists.,
"Love it. Easy to use, does what it says",
Works smooth and great for shared collaboration,
It took two years but I can now organise tasks much more flexibly,
A widget update - smaller font - would be nice.,
Support and bug fixes are super fast!,
UI is great!,
"Love to use this App, and it's easy.",
Very good solution to Improve my business.,
Have to buy premium to do anything,
"Great app, very smooth, clean and fast.",
Great app  especially gmail integration,
"Love the update. 10/10, will update again!",
I'm more organized thanks to this!!,
"Trying for ages to get something that works and fits with Thunderbird and my mobile, chromebook, and laptop.",
Reminder does not work!,
Really useful app,
"Works across all platforms, amazing!!!!",
Helps me stay organized!!!,
Great app love it!,
Really improved productivity.,
Very intuitive UI design....,
It's awesome,
I don't want to set a date but every number I put turns into the date. I miss the previous version. I may have to switch to something else,
Nice app,
Perfect,
Clean UI,
"Absolutely love this app. Just wishes it worked with Google task.  06/23/15:  My Review of since Material Design Update: Okay. Just updated. It's already not passing the test.  All my to-do's have been pushed back 1 day. Everything on the desktop version still looks fine though.  The material design looks nice, but who cares if app is now broken",
"Material Design update: Looks pretty but all task dates are now off by a day. Please fix. A solid foundation and a generally good app. Needs more functionality in the repeatable tasks area, views of projects/tasks more than a few weeks out is confusing (where day of week is still main header), etc. But I'm a premium payer, hoping it will get better. I also know that Google Tasks is gonna get a revamp and will slay this whole market. Who, when push comes to shove, does it better than G.?",
"The material design update is nice, but I reaallly would love the ability to press and hold on a project in the list to get an option to edit the project (move it left or right, rename, delete) and also add project above/below/as child project.  ""Manage projects"" is slow and laborious when adding more than 1 project",
"Yet another app that hurts itself by ""going Material"" - except you can hardly call it that. It's just white - white everywhere, with missing borders, layers, and depth. Everything is suddenly half the size, yet taking up twice the space. And why are tasks pre-filled with useless placeholders? I don't HAVE a gym membership to renew. Why can I no longer add tasks in expanded view by default? Feels like this was largely an attempt to make the app ""simpler,"" except the compromises made it worse for everyone.",
A bit overboard on form over function. Hard to read fonts due to colors and too much wasted white space. Buttons on a menu bar without any labels to indicate what they do. Have to touch them just to find out.,
Been using this for about 2 weeks now. Good for keeping track of little tasks I need to complete.,
I use it on 3 platforms and it's great. Today I updated the Android version and all my tasks for today got bumped to tomorrow and I am unable to move them to today for some reason. Tried restarting my phone with no luck.,
It does do what I need. It really is what I was looking for. The free version is great for testing. I'll purchase my license as soon as possible.,
"The problem i have with this app is new item will be on the bottom of list, i prefer top, can't sort them",
Great little app. Came pre-installed and now use it all the time,
The best wonderful tablet interface and a very clean phone interface. :),
And the karma concept is cool :),
Found exactly what I was looking for.many many thanks to developers.,
It won't let me add a task to today. It defaults everything to tomorrow...,
The best of the to do apps,
"This might be the best to-do app I've used. I've tried many. All of the features I found that I liked I different apps, are all in this one. Multiple levels of subtasks and subprojects, notifications, reminders, notes, attachments......it has it all.",
"Finally, I've got it MD. It's really cool!",
perfect for the purpose.,
The free version works reasonably well. It does some things better than other apps (e.g. deeply nested subprojects and subtasks) and others not as well (e.g. filtering). The premium version has a few more bells and whistles and boatloads of unfulfilled promises. Do NOT buy it unless you are happy with it exactly the way it is.,
"This is the only task management app that I have been able to stick with.   The interface is intuitive,  and it has the best repeating task functionality I've seen.   The only thing I really want to see added is better business account features, such as the ability to see tasks completed by others.   When that comes out I will move my whole team to todoist.",
"Trying the free month of premium. Very simple to use, but all my tasks and projects in one folder suddenly deleted. I do not know if I did it or it was a program bug. If I did it it should be harder to do. When I imported the last backup, it took a long time to format it correctly. Hopefully this doesn't happen again because otherwise the app is nice because of its simplicity.",
This app has been absolutely amazing and I have already recommended it to many of my friends. The only reason that I didn't rate it five stars is because it doesn't work alongside a calendar. A calendar helps keep a visual picture of what's going on and I love an app that integrates a calendar and todo list into one.,
"Have been looking for a to do list app and this one was recommended by a friend. I wish you could put tasks in multiple categories. I created a category called ""craft projects"" and have all my crafts under it, but sometimes I need to buy things for my crafts and either have to put them under crafts or shopping. It'd be nice if I could put them under both categories :)",
"To do apps generally have a small feature set that eventually drives me back to pencil and paper. Todoist has a complete, but not overwhelming, feature set that works well on desktop or phone. The sync feature is indispensable as well. The only issue I have is that sometimes sync can be a little slow, so I'm not sure whether I haven't checked something off or if it's just synchronizing.",
"This is a superb program, both in Windows and on Android.  I had been using Wunderlist, and just switched to Todoist, which works far better, particularly in terms of being able to update due dates, which is very tedious to do in Wunderlist.  Todoist also has integration in Outlook, so you can turn emails into tasks without leaving Outlook.  You can also email tasks directly to individual projects.  They're also just rolling out integration with Evernote.",
"I've been wanting an app I can input all the stuff I need to do so I can remember and check things off, to keep myself organized. This app does it all. Though it's far from perfect, it's much closer than many other apps I have used or use on a daily basis. Definitely worth AT LEAST a download.",
After using it for a week it's not disappointed me once - an unusual occurrence with apps! Especially love the flexible method for setting up recurring tasks; something strangely missing from many task managers.  And the presentation is immaculate. Great (and free unless you need the full feature set) app.,
"At first I was thoroughly in love with this app. Love the ability to create super specific recurring tasks and love the karma reward system. Here's the problem. I want to mark a task as not complete and take a karma hit without deleting it completely, especially if it's a recurring task. I've seen this requested in the support threads and the staff always talk it down but I really need this feature to fully utilize the karma system the way I want to. I would pay for premium if that feature were included.",
I've tried all of them and nothing beats todoist. The ability to set due dates at a specific time and have them ordered that way is a must for me. The ability to have sub projects and sub tasks helps me organize my life and the ability to set due dates using real speak is amazing. The ability to add notes is also huge for adding important task related info. I used to use wunderlist but the lack of task order and multiple sub task levels was a deal breaker.,
I've been using Todoist for a couple of years and always thought it excellent. The only thing missing for me was a good Android app and now we have one. It's been great to watch Todoist evolve and I'm sure they'll think up other ways to make this already excellent product even better.,
"I have slowly changed my review from 5 to 2 stars throughout the past few months because of todoists so called enhancements. I think the most troubling thing for me is the support sight that I am currently a part of (as a premium user) and see no real progress of customer care. (I'm tired of fighting to help Todoists become great again.) If I wasn't already integrated into it, I would more than likely jump ship.",
"Very useful for managing tasks on the move, though a couple of additional features would make a massive improvement. Firstly, a ""send to history"" option to deal with stuck sub-tasks. Secondly, it's way too easy to lose new notes by clicking the tick icon instead of the ""note save"" icon - the note should either be saved automatically, or the user warned.",
"I've been looking for a to-do list tool that handles recurring tasks and one-time tasks (and those weird recurring tasks that happen on the last Tuesday of the month or whatever). Todoist does exactly what I wanted and does it well. I wish the paid upgrade wasn't a recurring subscription.  I love the ability to see completed tasks because it's very motivating, but I don't have the budget to make it happen. Maybe someday.",
"So far I love the free version, I am just starting with premium so I can't rate that yet. However, I have searched for a long time for a digital task list this in depth and have used multiple other options with the exception of Evernote  (which I will try next if Todoist isn't as cool as I think now) so far I am extremely impressed. Thank you Todoist and I'm only sad I didn't find you sooner!",
"I can honestly say that this is by far the best task manager app, I'm trying to introduce it in the company I work as well. My only negative remark is about the v 10, there should be at least an ETA by now for the Android version. It's getting annoying a bit.",
"This app is very useful.  There are very few bells and whistles.  Its all business, which can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for in a to-do list.  If you're goal is to get work done and stay organized, this app will work for you.  Just be warned: some of the best features require you to subscribe for a year.",
I run a small business and there are hundreds of things on my to do list. This app makes it so easy to organize and prioritize everything in my life for both work and my personal to do's. I also love the ranking system that allows me to strive for achievements in accomplishing my tasks! Highly recommended to anyone on any type of device.,
"I love that I can use this on my Android phone, a standalone Mac application and with good Chrome browser integration. I've been using the free version for a while now and have stuck with it in a way that hasn't worked with other apps I've tried. If it allowed me to sort tasks on the mobile application (as you can on Mac and Chrome) then that would be great!",
"New version is a downgrade. New materials design reduces information density, doesn't add any useful features, and destroys the add task from the widget.  Longstanding feature requests remain unaddressed-- e.g., the inability to view a project's subprojects at once. Continuing inability to tag multiple items. No dark theme.   Just went to TickTick, and it's a huge improvement.",
"Very intuitive and I like the format better than Gmail tasks (which is no longer free for my iPhone). I just use it to manage my own tasks, so I don't invite people or use the upgraded version.  But the free version is great. It syncs across my laptops, iPhone, and android phone seamlessly. I have my list wherever I am.",
Todist has terrific task management features. The collaboration part is excellent. Moving tasks around is so easy. I love it. Except one thing. The filter disappoints me. It doesn't allow filtering on tasks assigned to specific team members.,
tried all the other to do list apps...prefer todoist. really like its simple design and using its subtasks...the thing that i don'tj like is the way you add (sub)tasks - that is just clumsy...also having my projects as my main view would be nice...location reminders seems nice but i dont know if it really got the right location. adding tasks with photos would be nice...thanks,
"As soon as I think of something I  forgot to do, an hourly occurrence, I stick it on here. Even better though is the multiple project and repeating task function, which allows me to set daily and weekly goals for myself.",
"I prefer this hierarchical style for my lists. Todoist works well and keeps things simple. That said, now that I'm used to navigating this app, I'd like to see a few features that I could activate. An option to link to a""next task, "" better management of recurring tasks, increased connectivity with other apps.... Some of these seem to be rolling out, which I applaud. Others seem to be overlooked. All in all, though, a great resource for me.",
"In a recent reply, Doist notes that Android *was* the first priority platform for development. The use of past tense there worries me. The potential of an Android device far surpasses that of an iOS device; but this potential isn't being reached as developers prioritize the iOS platform. I understand iOS still has a strong command of the targeted market, but developers (all - not intending to single out Todoist, I use the app everyday on 3 different platforms) need to give users a reason stick with Android.",
"Lovely easy to use app, and it's brilliant that all of your tasks sync across all of your devices. However, actual functionality differs between devices and while the Android app is mostly fine, it's not possible to filter within projects on Android (it is possible everywhere else). So sometimes it's difficult to get the information you actually need. If this was fixed though, and they've said that it's 'coming soon', then this will be basically a perfect app",
"I have tested and have been using all of the best to-dos apps and todoist v.7 is the best of the best. I like Wunderlist, it has for ex. free comments but non-flat subtask system. Todoist has. I like Asana but it hasn't offline cash which is important when you travel. Basically I use todoist for write down a new project when I travel because ver 7 has nice flat design even on small phone (better than 8 beta Material). Todoist works great with IFTTT and toggl. Cheers.",
"By far, the best task list out there for me. Simple and effective interface, quick data entry, and multiple options for organizing your tasks. Could use a little work on the user interface to reduce the number of clicks and time required to assign a due date, label, or project but the issue is not bad enough to take a star away.",
"When you quickly create a new task and don't set a due date, in the '7 day view' it disappears! I use this app to make sure I don't forget things but when that task disappears from the list I lose that reminder, and the app starts losing its value to me.",
This app is wonderful!  It has helped me to manage projects better than any others I have tried.  The push notifications are 1 per day (as things are coming due) and couldn't work better.  And the syncing from computer to phone is seamless!  Highly recommended.,
"I use this for tasks I want to do at some point over the course of the day and things I want to do eventually. It's a great way to keep the stuff with no set start our end time and stuff I'd like to do eventually from cluttering my google calendar, where I keep appointments with a set date, start and end time.",
"If you're looking for a simple, digital to-do list that syncs across all of your devices, look no further. I use this for work tasks every day and couldnt be happier. I love that I can create a task on my phone and it syncs with my work PC and tablet. Love it",
"I've tried many different to do lists and this one beat the others. Many of them have the same features but Todoist just sits right with me. One small complaint is that the widget shows days that don't have tasks, which takes up unnecessary space. Highly recommended!",
"Notifications are so temperamental, recently that rarely work properly.  Your integration with IFTTT is great when it works. And recently your app is so horrendous. 'couldn't understand your due date' when I'm trying to add a reminder time, not even the right error. Poor.",
"I love this app and the service behind it! We use this in our household for reminders, shopping lists, daily, weekly and monthly tasks. The real-time synchronization and update makes it an excellent collaboration tool. The possibility of ordering, setting reminders, repeating tasks and sub-tasks means you can use this tool however you see fit yourself, without the app or service restricting you. Would give 10 stars if I could!",
"This has taken my lack of organization and revolutionized it. I have tried using calendars and todo apps before, but they always lack the organizational structures that my mind desires. Being able to create sublevel upon sublevel of task enables me to set up complicated systems that imitate the assignment lists for school. I can structure it in a way that makes it clear what needs to be done when and what is related to what.",
The best part of the app is the minimalistic interface which has enough options to set tasks easy. I use the web version when not on the phone and have had no issues between the 2 syncing. It responds well on my older LG Mach and plan to stick with the app on a new phone.,
"This is a very well organized application. You can use it in very simple ways, but it scales up to much more complex use scenarios without becoming unmanageable. The ability to schedule repeated occurrence is of certain asked makes it invaluable for people who have daily checklist.",
"I wouldve given it 5 stars if it allowed either of the following  - Automatic Task Scheduling for Repetitive tasks that have many sub-tasks (like automatically have a reminder to check-in a day before the flight, send boarding pass after the flight, etc)  - Project management  Without either of them.. its not a complete solution.",
The key to not getting overwhelmed is having a clear picture of what needs to be done. Breaking projects into bite sized tasks makes the work manageable. The software easily allows you to drag and rearrange tasks. Maybe something you planned for today can wait until Thursday. No problem.  Over time you learn to prioritize and accurately scope what can be done in a day. It's also a great tool for tracking longer term goals without fixed due dates. Record your idea now and assign it a time frame later on.,
"This is a great app, I've been using the premium version for more than a year and have been happy recommending it to many of my colleagues. 5 stars would be well-deserved, except for one unpleasant experience... after the last update, synchronization of the desktop app suddenly stopped working and I lost more than a week of entries. I hated that! Developers, make sure that your updates are bug-free!!! Thanks",
It's a good app for project management and business task tracking. I felt it wasn't a good fit for me. I don't want to low ball it in stars for that one reason so 3 it is. Good just not for someone looking for a simple to do task organizer.,
This comment is on previous version. I havent updated to this version yet.  I personally liked its very simple pleasant to eyes user interface and the date entry method..you just type however u want and it takes automatically in right format. Also as a Project manager i can easily divide my tasks into separate  projects and the pending task list view gives which project the task is from time and task name...key points as a PM i need to know. Havent tried the collaboration mode as i didnt needed it for  now.,
"I started using todoist when I wanted a todo list wherever I was, whatever device I was using. My job lives in outlook on my PC, and it's plugin has got me on top of what I need to do. It syncs with my android in a flash, and allows me to easily add something when someone stops me in the hall.  I also take advantage of the android wear and add tasks without even taking out my phone. Reminders, this thing has them, it can email you, SMS you, or send a notification to your mobile apps.  So good I ran out of r",
"I really appreciate that I can send items via ""If this then that"", I'm sending my Amazon Echo shopping list to Todoist. We sync a shared shopping list at our house ever since Palm Pilots. This is a proper todo app and starts and is usable within a second; unlike Amazon's Echo app which takes 30s every single time you  start it & makes me want to rage quit it (their Alexa Echo hardware is nice though). Some learning curve such as hold drag to rearrange the list but it does all I need, simply.",
"I have no prob working across all devices -Desktop, smartphone,tab and Gmail.I got it for the color-coding of projects and smart scheduling thru keywords. Giving only 4 stars bec I wished syncing is automatic across all devices.",
"Clean, simple interface and powerful feature set makes this a winner. I finally found the perfect combination between the power of ToodleDo and the clean simple GTD like interface of DoIt.IM task managers.  Six things Todoist has that make it a winner: 1 - great interface 2 - Customization / Flexibility 3 - ""Karma"" feedback 4 - Apps for all platforms 5 - Great support 6 - super responsive web site  I really believe this app and the corresponding web site give you all the tools to get things done and keep track of how well you are doing.",
"I've been using the app for a few days and it helps me remember all the small things I need to do. I wish I knew about a way to download my daily activity, to plan better for the future. I will recommend it to my friends and coworkers.",
"As an Astrid user, it took me a long time to find a proper replacement when it shut down. Have been using todoist for roughly a year now and I'm finally happy with my task manager.",
"I have tried pretty much EVERY task list app on the market but I like TD the best because I can set priorities, classify tasks and even share AND assign tasks (a feature that my husband in particular is not QUITE so fond of!  :-) ). I would say the one drawback is that there is mixed functionality across platforms - hence the downgrade to 4 stars but it is definitely my ""go to"" productivity app that I use at both work and home.",
This is by far the best service I've ever used for my to do lists. It's seamless across all platforms and integrates well with Sunrise calendar (my calendar of choice). Only problem is one I never knew I had until Google released app specific cards for Google now. My other to do list app took advantage of it but Todoist hasn't yet. It would be the icing on the cake for a truly excellent app.,
"I've tried 'em all.  Sure,  some were of course really good,  but there was always something small missing - or just  plain annoying. This app nails it.  Clean,  quick, all I want and no overdone bells or whistles. The ONLY thing I would like is a way to customize it - I'm big on aesthetics,  and that's all that I notice lacking so far with this app. If you guys did something about that,  I sure wouldn't mind!",
"Todoist is a pretty powerful app that can go a step beyond a to-do list, and it's particularly good for people who tend to work solo -  a lot of the other popular task lists/managers are really geared toward teams, and while that's great, I don't often work as part of a regular coordinated team, so a lot of the features of those other applications really don't apply to me.  I'd say that Todoist's best feature is the clean user interface. It's easy to read, easy to add tasks to (and the Chrome extension is very good for this) and lays out what you need to do for the week very nicely.  There are some cons, though. It's not obvious how to create subtasks and there's an extra step involved that I don't think is necessary. There are a couple of snags relating to repeating tasks. If you have a repeating task with subtasks, the subtasks are not ""uncompleted"" when the task refreshes (only the parent task is). If you have a repeating task that is overdue and you mark it as done, the current deadline is skipped and the task refreshes for the next one, which can throw you off a bit if you still have to  do the task for the current period.  All in all, it's a worth a try.",
very easy to add tasks as they arise. prioritization and categorization features are helpful. a very useful tool for keeping the things you need to do front and center.,
"Very powerful, but also has features for psychologically encouraging me to finish tasks, like karma and the ability to watch the number of remaining tasks decrease.",
When i installed this i was pretty surprised how the app worked but when it asked me to upgrade to premium just to unlock few new things...  I immediately regret installing it... Guys... There are free apps who ask 0 royalties to pay for all the things you ask to pay... I will go back to Wunderlist...  Uninstalled,
So many key features to remind you and to assist you in keeping track of your tasks. Can't love without it.,
"Was using a different product, but wasnt completey happy.  Tried ToDoIst and havent looked back!  Only gripe is that is requires premium for reminders, but I had no issue going Premium as ToDoIst really helps me maintain productivity.",
"I was a long time outlook windows user, thought nothing can be better till Todoist. It works in my PC, iMAC, Android phone, iPAD.",
"I only wish I could set reminders without requiring an upgrade, but the current features work for me.",
It's the simplicity of it all.  If I have an idea I put it on here.  And it becomes reality.  I have a lot less oh crap I forgot something moments.,
"I can't find a manual anywhere so I don't know what I'm doing with this app. It's probably just me being a bit dumb. Thanks for reply, I knew it was me being dumb.",
"Todoist gives you many desirable features in a simple interface. To name a few, projects, infinite subtasks and nesting, labels, sharing, and drag and drop.",
"Thank you for creating this app for the people who has alot to do. I find this app usefull for my things to download on my computer like games, AntiVirus and more... Keep it up make it better if u can",
"I used it to organised my life now. Brilliant functionality, well designed. Never had any crashes or errors either. Good app.",
"I like this app. It makes managing my life a lot easier and works extremely well. However, I really dislike the subscription model. I'd rather pay a one time fee, even if it was relatively high. I'd also like to see the shortcut options available on PC, such as the ability to do !! To set a priority level. In addition, material design has been ""coming soon"" for about 3 months. It really needs that design overhaul.",
"After all the great reviews i gave this a try and its great for one person but the synchronization across multiple devices needs work and was very unreliable. We spent more time trying to make sure we all saw what was supose to be there than we did using it.  Upon sharing a project, 2 users couldn't see all the tasks under it, one user couldnt see any of them and the other could see less than half.  The user that couldn't see any on their phone could see them all on their pc. Too unreliable.",
Really easy to use and share projects with colleagues. Great support from the todoist team as well,
Very good app.  Only qualm I have is that you can't implement the michael linenbeger TWC system which I use. Which needs a start date field and a group by Priority option.,
"Having attended Franklin Covey 5 choices & his original training several times over the last decade,  I found this app to help me align learned techniques / principals with my daily level of execution. True Game Changer!",
"Ready to use, week organized, nice design. For stars because of the prominent nature of features you have to pay to use",
The only app to organise myself that ive been able to keep using. Love that i receive emails to remind me what tasks i have overdued. It is really helpful,
"Apparently, the premium version offers reminders but the best I can tell is that it alerts you 30 minutes before the task is due. It needs an alarm that goes off at the time you want to do something. Maybe premium has this but I can't tell.",
Adding a task is bit stressful if adding long term goals. The app has best performance other wise.,
"Great way to organize things, with many helpful features. The ""postpone until tomorrow"" button is really great ;). Also integrates with Sunrise calendar!",
I've tried many apps helping to organize the increasing number of things to be done. Todoist is by far the best. The intelligence put into developing the functionality is impressive. Keep up the good work.,
All the useful bits cost a LOT of money. The free version hasn't even got reminders. I consider that a rip-off. Buy yourself Business Calendar for a much better experience for a lot less cash.,
"Almost what I'm looking for, but it lacks start dates. A workaround is to set a reminder on the start date, and set the deadline as recurring until the target date.",
"Before todoist I kept my task lists for work and home separate, scribbled in notepads and stickey notes. The productivity boost I've received is well worth the cost.",
"Love the app, fits both my work and personal needs. In Android everything fine. Only issue use that the pc and web app don't work well, for example the tags or task creation. Please fix it",
Great app so far. It would be nice if they had a default notification option so I don't have to change it for every single reminder.,
This app got me through college. Deceptively simple interface and tons of advanced features. I've been with Todoist since their early days and the updated just keep getting better and better.,
"I like the app, it just has some updating issues. Normally, it updates right away. However, occasionally it will not update at the server, so changes are not reflected on my laptop's version(i.e. the website).",
"Only nice for those who have shiploads of todolists and like bells and whistles on it and a study to learn to use it. Too bloated for me. Also, I dislike being spammed.",
The best app to manage your daily activities. I have gone through several apps but this is best. Only important can be done is to have an option of viewing and exporting all tasks in to an excel sheet.,
"This is the best To Do List I've ever used. I love the email reminders at the start of each day. I like that I can share with others. Easy to use. I would like to have an audible alarm for a reminder, but maybe it has that and I haven't found it yet.",
Works perfect for my lif e right now. Any new devices i get. Ea sy to hook right back up and always keep s everything good and safe for me,
Had to turn off the annoying daily digest emails but besides that it's a solid app,
"From what I can tell so far, this is a well-designed, simple utility app I'll enjoy using. However, there's one thing I feel could be improved which irks me immediately: the back button should do just that - take the user back to the main screen from any project, menu, list, etc. they're in, but instead it closes the app when pressed, often unnecessarily.",
"I loved the features on the free version that i am really desperate to go on to the full version. Has helped me in small steps, but in a big way.",
"I'm enjoying the features, and it's keeping me organized. I'm just working on pacing myself. I want to get premium so I can get reminders.",
Beautiful interface. Can do everything I want. Specially love the ability to add subtasks. Which actually made me move from Wunderlist.,
"It's not too fancy, so it forces me to focus on actually completing tasks. Projects and other awesome features are available on the free version also.",
Great interface. The score system is motivating. Fantastic calendar integration with sunrise. Plenty of ways to categorize tasks. Take my money,
"I'm fairly new, but I like this app. I appreciate having my tasks shared across my computer and phone so easily.",
I'm using Todoist in conjunction with some GTD / The Secret Weapon ideas.  A very clean and capable interface.,
"Don't get me wrong, I love this app and the way how it integrated with IFTTT, but wish it is more customizable!! Especially the widget, add some ""transparency"" would be awesome, as well as a dark theme! Dying to get the update with material design! Thanks anyway:)",
"Simple to use, but very powerful. Syncing across devices is great, reminders are effective without being intrusive. Ui is intuitive.",
That s app is what i would like to use. I tried too many apps for to do listing. But this app is best for meeting my needs.,
Very usefull app & still getting better and better. I like the offline feature which also works with web interface.,
it sorts order of tasks by date and time (unlike any.do) but push notifications do not work so i miss the reminders. so uninstalling the app and replacing with the simplest reminder app instead,
A handy tool to have when u really want to get things done.,
Doesn't work on the M Preview for Nexus 6. Trying to add a task makes screen go black.,
"I setup my team with the Todoist Business trial and started regaining my sanity. After getting everything migrated from Google Tasks and setup to collaborate with my team, there is no going back. It is so fast to make and change entries, it makes it an effortless process to get organized and stay on target.",
I have been using this app since I downloaded it. It is really really good. It can set reminders and you can do all kinds of stuff with it. N even integrate into your email to Microsoft Outlook and Gmail.,
"Tried many task managers - this seems to me to have the best balance of features with a clean, intuitive interface.",
"This is the best task list app I've found, and I've tried several.  Great organization, easy entries (and changes), and syncs easily across all my devices.",
Great App. I use 4 platforms and love how it integrates seemlessly with all of them. Still using free version but paid version is likely in my near future.,
Mostly this app rocks.  Especially as it syncs across desktop and phone.  Wish there was more functionality in the free version or that the paid version was much less expensive.,
"Everything I need, switched from wunderlist because I needed the features and this has them all in spades. Now upgraded to the business version as my colleagues needed it as much as me.",
Todoist has been nothing short of brilliant.  It is the tool I have been wanting for a long time.,
"I love this app. It helps me stay organized. Like anything, you have to invest the time to enter your information. I love it. Thank you.",
I enjoy you can sync all the apps together and it has a nice widget for android. Would like if you can sync with Google calendar too,
Scheduling tasks is a little clunky. It would be nice if I could assign a category with one tap instead of a menu. It would be nice if tasks saved automatically without having to check a new task after writing it. It would be nice to set up recurring tasks.,
"Simple, easy to use has some pay features for those who are interested.",
It very good app keep reminding me my small pending tasks trough mail and notifications... no more need to tie a knot on finger ^_^   :),
Helping me to work constructively in the simplest way that I've ever come across. Keep it up guys,
"I haven't found any other ""to-do"" app that can be this light, simple and effective as this one. I might go premium, but I need more time to get used to it.",
I've been using this app for a couple years and it's been a key element in keeping me organized. I've never had any issue from updating the app or OS.,
"I've tried them all, beats wunderlist by a landside. Poor subtask interface on desktop app and Outlook plug in fails constantly.",
Would probs die w/o it 9/10,
Best to do app. I liked the simplicity. Using almost  for an year. I found it as the way to avoid procrastination for me.,
I like the fact that you can do subtasks. Would give it 5 stars if you could assign them due dates as well.,
"I've tried quite a few TODO apps, and this is the best for personal and family tasks. For professional teams, I'd maybe use something more complex.",
I am new to this application and so far it is helping me keep organized with many differentent events going on in my life. I like it.,
"Además de organizar por proyectos, deja crear subtareas de diferentes niveles, para aquellos que tienen equipos que les cuesta trabajo adaptarse a un gestor de tareas, podrán entender que actividad específica deben hacer y para que que van a lograr.",
"Simple, working with all platforms(for me), has reminders, active support team. I really liked it",
"Has some usability issues (is not polished enough for my taste to give it full 5 stars). Otherwise a solid piece of software, the overall best I have tested.",
This is the exactly the balance between simplicity and functionality I've been looking for. Need a Windows 8/10 app though.,
Not working on outlook 2007. I don't wish to  renew subscription,
"I'm not to sophisticated in planning, and this app was perfect for me.",
"The app is good on the phone and the browser. A great addition would be to sort by date, priority, or alphabetical. It is just a simple feature that should have been implemented from version 1.0.  If this is added soon then I will raise it to 5 stars.",
"After trying numerous other list apps, I found todoist to have the right balance of flexibility and ease of use for my needs.",
"I have been looking for something like this for a dogs age. It links everything together, browser, phone even outlook and it just works. And also well with the upgrade to pro version. Top marks",
"Clean structure of recording thoughts and action items - enough flexibility to not hinder free flow / customization. Multi platform support lets you stay on top anywhere, anytime. Loved it so much that I went premium within a day of use. Highly recommended.",
"The app is really good,  and helps to keep me organised,  I would like of it recognises more informally mentioned due dates",
I'm able to list my to do items and get them done more effectively and efficiently with this app. Love it,
"Great app! Very easy to use, no learning curve. It works well with Gmail. You can save emails easily to your to do list",
No nonsense task scheduler. Send email reminders as well as popup notifications so you shouldn't miss a task.,
I use this mostly for side (software) projects but it works for any kind of list. The widget let's you add and view and edit from the second you open your phone. Faster than any.do (Which I use for personal to-do lists),
"This program helps me keep my duties in all the different areas straight. It doesn't open on my computer every time I click on it for some reason but does on my phone and tablet. Sometimes OK on the computer, sometimes won't open at all. Syncs well on all.",
Please provide an option at what time the to-do mail must hit inbox along with date,
"Recent updates have seen some hiccups along the way, but still worthy of 5 stars.",
I usually just write on a notepad or even on my phone but it's a help when I set due dates and reminds me when they are past due. Easy to use,
Helps me organize every part of my hectic life.,
"Easy to set up, but also very powerful once you get really working with it. Moreover, the fact that you can use it on multiple platforms makes it so much easier to capture all your tasks.",
"I've been using the browser version of todoist for a few years and I've always loved it. The app doesn't disappoint either, it is very easy to use and intuitive.",
"Works flawlessly across devices and seems to have the right balance of flexibility and simplicity. Customer support is also great, proactive and quick.",
"Having these reminders pop up is great! I don't have to keep thinking ""Must remember xxx"". And I love how multi-device friendly the app is. Good job!",
"This app allows me to focus on the big things,  remember the small things and to attempt to be successful in all i attempt",
"4 months back you committed to rectify this problem as google drive files/ sheets are not able to upload from Android version, we are a paid members, please help.",
Been a great tool to keep me organized and honest with myself on how much work I'm getting done. Smooth app that integrates well with all its other platforms.,
I love using this on my mac and my android phone. It's tough to find good cross platform tools like this!,
"Only been using for a few days. I'm still trying to figure out the functions for me,  but so far I like it.",
Forgetting far fewer tasks. Unless I forget to add in the app of course.,
"Until this app gets the update we've been promised, one star. By the way, I'm a beta tester and we haven't even gotten the update yet. This development team never ceases to amaze me with how terrible they are.",
"I rely heavily on this app to help keep me organized and on track with the tasks that I need to do in my life, both personally and professionally.",
"I've used several productivity apps, but this one is the most effective at helping me get more done.",
I put in several tasks and would like to share and sync with my other devices.  There are glowing descriptions on what this app can do but no instructions within and impossible to figure out.  Guess this one is going to be deleted.,
I've used many tools (including GTD based tools) but what makes this great is integration with outlook (Add email as task) .. Brilliant.,
"not working properly on myobile like unable to select my city name, and similary other features not working",
"A very good tool and simple to use. Like the fact it sinks across devices, and the Web one is handy. The free version could have allowed for notes at least. Thought it might be good to keep completed activities somewhere for reference.",
"Franklin, Covey, others will find what is needed to make their process work. I was surprised to see that I use the Karma feature.  It showed me that I often over estimated my ability to get my To Do's done on schedule.  Thanks",
"Elegant, easy to use, recurring tasks, it's a must have for busy people!",
It is very useful and the integration with Gmail is great. Also being able to share a project with other people is awesome.,
"I've tried a lot of to do list apps, and this is the one I keep coming back to. The pro version looks great, but this is the first task list app I've used where all the features I really need are available for free (and without ads). Great UI and cross-platform functionality, too. Highly recommended.",
Simple and easy to use. Available of both Mac and PC platform. I like the ability to create many projects and subprojects. Would have preferred to see it integrated to email and phone systems which Any.do has.,
"Todoist is just the GTD task manager I was looking for.  I have many task apps, including Omnifocus on iOS.  Todoist surpasses them all in utility, hands down.  Being available on so many platforms is the key to ease of use (browser at work  and  phone everywhere else).  Premium is well worth it.  My gain in productivity is much more than the cost.",
"Todoist is a simple, effective, and efficient task manager. Used correctly, it helps you get more done daily, and gives you peace of mind that your most important goals have been accomplished.",
"A task app is only as good as your willingness to use it. Easy to add quickly with time and date, paid app allows asking more detail/notes/research later. Easy to push items out and find future items. Use with IFTTT and keep Evernote versions. Just plain good utility here.",
I love that this app syncs beautifully across all my devices and even on the Internet.   I am looking forward to the future updates.,
I certainly need a task app to keep me on track. This one has been the best and the one I've stayed with the longest. Also works well for task sharing.,
"Sub-tasks is really useful for the way I work, and the parser is nice. Still figuring my way around the interface a bit but it's pretty easy to start using",
"Great task list.   Easy to use,  great multi platform sorry makes keeping up with list ready where ever I am.",
I'm a solopreneur and I live my life by this app and through the Chrome browser extension and the Gmail app. It's simple and uncomplicated. My extended network now have it and we share projects. Less is more.,
"love the 5 levels of subtasks, the filters, the ability to set due dates and repeats so naturally. I've lived on my to do apps for years and checked out Todoist again recently to find it's passed all the others in functionality and interface.",
The app is amazing but the view in the widget gets reset again and again. And every time after reboot. Needs to be fixed! Very annoying!,
This simple app really works on all platforms which makes actual tasks easy to work with despite where ever you are. But be prepared to pay for the full year supply because you'll get fully use to it and can't live without it,
"Very impressed. Easy to use, integrates well with other apps and services such as sunrise calendar and meetup, and available for mac and android.  I switched from wunderlist and it feels very similar. Love the points you get for completing tasks.",
I've used many task apps over the years but this is the best.  Easy to add due dates. Great for sharing to do lists with colleagues and family.  Have recommended to lots of people.,
You just can't forget your tasks. I recommend to everyone that have many things to do.,
Keeping last star for possibility to print and more importantly for a plug-in for outlook for Mac,
"Considering to buy it after New Year. Did not find how to change language. It chose english as it was default language on my Google account. As a ukrainian, I wish it gave me at least the choice, but I've allready got uset to and see it as a way to improve my english. Husbend did not like the app at all because it does not attach video, photo etc.",
"One week after creating an account, they emailed to offer one free month of the Premium version, no credit card required.  Syncs across all devices, and on desktop computer.  The interface is very user friendly.  Easy to prioritize tasks makes it possible to input all 'must do' and 'would like to do' tasks without anything getting overlooked.",
This app is really nice. It reminds you of tasks which you have forgotten earlier. It will also show the progress and productivity.,
Was just OK before alterations. Now uninstalling,
My year old requirement of having the perfect to do manager is over . seem lessly integrates with my postbox in mac..then with my android phone..jus too gud!,
The good: very intuitive interface. Responsive.                                       The wanting: multi step tasks.                                        The bad: nothing in particular.,
"Does what it says, syncs just fine across all of my devices, and most importantly, doesn't nag you.  I use it to plan my schoolwork for the week.",
For the most part it's exactly what I wanted. the only thing I can see that it might be missing is an alert when you haven't finish something by your assigned time.,
"I use this to coordinate my shopping list, home projects, hobbies, and family trips. It's great for keeping everyone on task and making sure each aspect of the housework gets addressed.",
You'll ask yourself how you ever worked without it.,
Works well and looks beautiful. When I use an app every day I want it to be beautiful. I love the cross device fonctionnality!,
"It's been a long road of task management apps. Todoist however, has proven to have the best organizational features while still maintaining the simplicity of what is needed in a task management system. It's prioritization and subtasks make organizing your tasks efficient and easy. Additionally, the ability to link and share content from other apps to Todoist streamlines your task management processes like no other app has ever done. Please, try this app out!",
Helps you manage your tasks and also you get reports through email about your progress in managing time and completing your tasks. Great tool.,
"This app works well for collaborative efforts even across multiple platforms (Android, Web, iOS, & Mac).",
Best to do list app due to dependency tasks... Simple yet indispensable,
"Been using many, but, for me, this one is the minimalist app packed full of features that is needed for both individuals and teams. Worth the premium investment.",
Helps me get on top of my list of to-do's. Free version is good enough for me,
I find this easier to mange different projects and integrates into more of my other applications such as outlook,
"The Android app works very well, very stable.  As a company the services is fantastic, quick responding to api questions. Can't fault todoist. Also they gave me a free t-shirt which is awesome.",
Fits my needs well.  Couple of things i would do differently but the fact that i run my life by it means i am happy.,
There are a few things I'd like to see added but the email reminders are a life saver!,
"I've used some todo apps that have more features, but it covers the essentials. This seems to be the best one for dictating the note to Google Now and have it automatically saved.",
Haven't used it real long but it's simple and it hasn't messed up any of my other apps or my phone.  GREAT THING !!!,
"Liked it and also found there's a charge for some features that others provide for free, so felt ridiculous. Now I'm in search of any other app.",
This is best TDL app out of all the ones I have tried. I just wish it listed items alphabetically too. :),
Finding the app very good for keeping me on track with my todo list. Love the Karma points. But... would be nice if tasks could be listed as works in progress.,
Unless you want to pay for pro version don't even bother with this.,
I have my own modified version of GTD that I have lived for the past three years. This is the most flexible and easiest to use app I have tried that does what I need from a time and task management perspective . I paid up after playing with it for an hour.,
Crashes as you try to create any task,
After using any.do for a while i searched competitors and found Todoist and i am not disappointed,
"For me, it has to be easy and accessible, and this fits the bill. Actual productivity increase. Very happy to be using this...",
I especially like being able to list in different categories and sharing the lists with others.   Unfortunately my wife likes the Honey Do list I created a little too much!  LOL,
"I just started using this app, but I'm really into it. I've tried a few different apps for tasks, and they all seem to have similar functionality, but Todoist looks the nicest to my eye, and organizes groups of task a bit better. The notifications (in-phone and through email) are nice, too.",
"Seems fancy app but without cal integration it's useless for me personally.  I work with google cal, drive ets. and need everything to be organised and that meen integration. Sorry",
Can't miss my plans. Not without todoist. Great app to start the day,
I find it most helpful. I can easily jot things down wherever I am. I love it.,
Only thing that is like so see is better integration with Google products.,
"But nothing in comparison with Google's Keep, only plus is sub tasks rest is all minus",
Very good to track your own to do list. Highly recommended,
"Any application that can't change to any of the predefined Android styles such as Material.Dark and .Light. I'm a SR Developer at IBM. No developer should be given ""Top"" status without implementing a dark and light theme. There are actually biological reasons why Dark is needed. The last thing I want to doo is use smali to read all the XML files in order to override the styles.",
"An incredibly intelligent scheduler, reminder, project manager. It even keys me set reminders to replace my Fentanyl patch every three days, the only app I've found that does! Fantastic app!",
"From a function and purpose perspective, the app is great and does as intended.",
This app is the best of the todo apps. Looking forward to seeing how the app improves and evolves.,
"Beautiful UI,  easy to navigate, and I love how you can update it from a variety of different devices.",
Recurring tasks + ability to tag for time needed to complete.. What else do you need?,
"With this app, my life become more chalengging and more color... I hope this app will improve better and better...",
It helps me easily keep track and reschedule event and task in order of importance.,
Very easy to use and helps me to be more efficient with my time. The reminders keep me on my toes.,
Switched over from To Do app.  I really like the Android Wear integration.,
"Haven't figured out everything yet, but I like it so far",
This app is great if owners are never around it keeps tabs on employees and gives them something to do if they are done with their normal tasks or need to prioritize.,
This is one of the first two apps I download on any new phone. Would be lost without it! Definitely recommend the Premium subscription. Great app and awesome Chrome extension as well.,
I really enjoy swiping away my tasks after I complete them or more often pushing then out ahead of me using the postpone feature.,
This app has been priceless in keeping me in check with personal and work list. Us its free,
It is so nice to have  a list with just my to do ' s on it.,
"Old tasks should be automatically postponed to the next day. But other than that, the app is great",
I enjoy using the app but some different colours for every label would be very nice .,
Has kept me on track through out the day! Would highly recommend it to anyone with a busy lifestyle!,
"This is a great todo app. No complaints, no sync iasues. I use the Firefox extension, Mac installed version, iPhone and android version. Have been using it heavily to track my work related tasks in it for the past 8 months. Absolutely love it.  The karma is a nice gamification that does not require having to sign up with social media and connect to friends. It just tracks how well you finish of tasks within deadlines.",
"Excellent time management app, easy to use and help get the stuff done.",
Has everything I need for scheduling and sharing projects in a simple way. Also loved the shortcuts on mac.,
This is the best task manager i have ever used. Its integration with several apps is amazing,
"Have tried every app that I have seen, this is my favorite",
"Notifications, emails.. It has everything you might need!",
"Seems to have most of what I want in a to-do/task list app. But ... either a) it doesn't do recurring tasks, or b) recurring tasks is a premium feature, or c) it's not obvious enough to me how to do recurring tasks.",
Helped 2 people share todo lists with each other across multiple devices and platforms. Easy.,
The fact that it's multi platform makes it easy to have the app installed in all devices.,
"This app is perfect for planning out tasks, and reminding you to stick to them.",
This app is awesome. It lets me keep track of everything I need to do for school.,
"Very simple to use, organised at last! Like being able to categorise tasks. No problems so far.",
It's like the love child of Google keep and evernote.,
Changing this to 5 stars. I've been a user for 2+ yrs and its amazing to see how this team has iterated release after release to cover all platforms and grow features. Great job!,
"Really find it easy to use and the e-mail alert keeps me on track, too.",
Great to do list. Helps me get things done.,
I keep my actions organized between mobile and desktop environments with no issues!,
I like being able to use Todoist on my phone and on my computer. Everything stays synced. Really useful.,
Such a great app to boost productivity. It'd be better if free version has the reminder option.,
Effective for call lists and simple projects across devices. I use it every day.,
"The premium features are too basic to be premium, for my taste. Beside that it's a must have",
"No hassle to do list tracking, clean interface and very friendly date entry. Recommend.",
Slightly limited as labels are only for paid users. Defintely a great app for people who are believers of GTD!,
Sadly you have to pay for the premium to get everything on this app,
I ve used several to do list apps--this one is one of the best.,
"Project sharing is great. Old incomplete tasks always show in past, which is a bit negative and of no use. Also, there's no daily ""plan your day"" feature.",
This is the app I was searching for. Simple to use. At the same time very powerful. Highly recommended this app.,
I have any other productivity Apps and this is by far the best yet. Great App! Well Done!,
"Suits my needs, easy to use. I love that I can share with another person.",
I used this with the desktop app. Syncs across platforms. I just use the free model,
I was a huge  Wunderlist user and I fell in love with Todist. Even the free version rocks!!,
I love this app.. however some capabilities are limited in free version unlike wunderlist.,
"Feature-wise, it's solid, but experience-wise, I struggle to use Todoist over Wunderlist, which is just much more mobile-friendly and consistent with the overall Android OS experience, in my opinion. Look how Wunderlist makes use of screen taps, the keyboard enter button, Android back button, and embedded push notif actions, for example. Todoist requires me to expressly complete every sequence (e.g., find/tap checkmark icon in UI instead of just hitting Android back button to save list item).",
I am using this app in desktop for more than 6 months. Now I am using it in mobile.,
Wish tasks were drag and drop to project and sub,
Requesting feature to drag tasks to projects on Android tablets,
"Does exactly what it's meant to and does it well. Consistent platform across every device imaginable. Fast, accurate sync. What are you waiting for?",
"I moved from Any.Do, and it fits my needs better. Two things though: I wish you could drag tasks between projects, and a dark theme. Other than that, works like a charm!",
I am very strategic and this app let's me categorize my to do lists however I want. Its a great organization tool!,
"Still working on building fully into day, but looking good so far",
As becoming more and more difficult to remember things,
This is one of the best To Do List applications that I have used so far.,
"I like how you can set different recurrences by just typing them in. I wish you could import tasks from outlook though, what is the point of being an outlook panel if outlook already has a tasks app?",
Well thank you very much for making my new habbit easier and consistently improved😀😀😀😀,
"Only wish you could sort within projects, labels or filters. Otherwise awesome!",
For those of us who need to write things down.,
you've missed the point of productivity,
Easy to use and simple. The first schedualing app that worked for me. Really nice.,
"Syncs wonderfully between chrome and my phone!  Easy to create, categorize, and prioritize tasks with deadlines.",
A we so productivity app easy to use and I keep coming back to use it again and again.,
Only thing missing is ability to apply labels simultaneously to multiple tasks,
Works well for me. I really needed something that works with Outlook but it is a bit costly to find out if premium will meet my needs. How about a 30 day premium trial for $9.99?,
I don't know what I would do without todoist,
Helps me to identify unplanned tasks and single place priority lookup,
I don't know where I'd be without it!,
"Helpful to keep things in order, and very user friendly.",
Always accessible and really quick to add to do's wherever you are!,
"No ads, no lag, easy to use. And great! Success!",
"Works as advertised, lots of features even with the free version.",
"Ok, I understand that reminders are now a Premium-feature. Will go to your competitors :)",
I have been completing more tasks per day thanks to the app.,
This does exactly what I need. Handy little app and great customer support!,
"I've tried lots of to do list app, this is the best so far. Across all platforms.. intuitive GUI.",
It helps me a lot to arrange my daily task!,
"Very easy to use, great integration across services. Gmail plugin is fab.",
"A windows store app would definitely help, but overall a great app!",
"It's a list app.. I am looking for a list app, period.  there are no sub categories available in the ""lists"" section. What's the point of making a list if you can't organize it?   That alone was a deal breaker for me, didn't try anything else in the app after seeing that.",
"Only couldn't find how to make tasks ""weekly""",
Fast and easy to use. Daily summary of what is planned and overdue is great.,
I'm new to todoist but loving how easy and simple it is to use !!,
"Loved the simplicity of this app, good job on UX, great job overall.",
"If only the free version supported local task notifications, this app would be perfect!",
I suggest you fix a reminder to the app. Quick notice before the actual time,
"organize work well, easy to access from web and app, love it",
This kept me  organized and clutter free! Karen & Dean,
"I have experimented with a bunch of todo list apps, and todoist is easily the best.",
I have tried lite version only and it is quite helpful for me.,
"It is a great app, user it every day to manage my tasks",
Hope u can improve user friendly ones.. ty,
Great app and great integration with browsers and Outlook.,
"This is my #1 to-do app; been using the premium version for almost a year now. One question - would it be possible to add a reminder-template in the form of ""in X minutes/hours""?",
This is a very basic to do list. But keeps me on task and is very simple.,
Great to do. Does what I want. Love the make task from email and webpage.,
Easy to use. Helps to keep track of everything. Love the project feature.,
Great app. Keeps me on task and reminds me of task that still need to be done.,
Even the free version lets you do great planing. Would recommend,
I'm hoping this will finally keep me more organized!,
"Great UI, great features and simple usability!",
Nice that I can check my to do's from my desktop and my tablet!,
This app works well on Note4. Syncing is also functionable.,
"It's great, I don't have to keep up with a note pad anymore.",
"I'm a basic user -I just want and use basic features,  and it just works.  Great.",
I use it to keep track of my crazy work schedules and I love it so much!,
It's one of the best to-do app which synchronizes beautifullly.,
Improved my productivity and available on all platforms I use!,
The cross platform is worth every penny!   Highly recommend it!,
Simple and easy to use.   Reminders for when you have a lot to do.,
"Loving it so far, great for WIG as well as daily goals.",
It has helped me become more efficient and effective.,
"great application, can be better if you can flatten the icon.",
"Moved from any.do, tried wunderlist. Todoist is the best around",
"I love this app for my to do list, grocery list, notes, collaboration, you name it.  I love it!",
Use this with google calender and love it.,
"Clean, well structured and syncs well.",
Tried a few systems. This one works the best for me. Especially the Outlook integration.,
Good functionality and easy to share with others and across devices.,
"I have used many apps, this is by far the best",
Best I've ever used.,
Nice easy interface and reminders to keep in track with options for task variety.,
Just what I need to keep track of what I need to get accomplished.,
"Easy and fast, I check my tasks on gmail, phone, tablet, web... If I could put it in my fridge I wouldn't be surprised.",
Great app! I bought an Android Wear watch just for this app!,
Works as it says it should.  Best part is how many different platforms it works on.,
I've been using it for a while. I liked it so much I purchased premium.!!,
"Good features, excellent UI",
Works great especially the syncing.   Like the notes option as well,
Syncs my phone and Outlook with todo list.  Amazing.,
Make it easier and quicker to add reminders.,
I use it a dozen times every day.,
It's seamless between my desk top and cell phone,
outstanding application. Works well with Android watches. probably best to do application in the Google store,
This is a quick and convenient method for creating notes and reminders.,
It's a nice app for track my schedule to be update with running tasks...,
And links to my gmail. Great for GTD,
Sangat membantu saya dalam mencatat daftar kegiatan dan tagihan saya. Thanks todoist,
"Great. If there is a option for calendar view, it would be greater.",
Todoist visualizes my productivity. This function makes me more motivated!,
I love that it works well over several different platforms.,
My daily tasks are getting fulfilled!!,
"I like the daily reminders, very helpful. Pretty good app.",
Very useful but does not support spit screen on my tablet otherwise 5 stars,
After I used this app my hole live have been organized thank you so much,
"Need more integration with Google products. Calendar, keep, Gmail end ect.",
"Seems very easy to use ,,,worked great the first week. We will see how it goes from here !!",
Would like to have option for notes in the free version,
Great for shared lists all users can edit,
Superb app. ...absolutely mind blowing. ..have tried lots of apps related to planning but this is really good. Superb synchronization with ios. ...,
I get tons done and enjoy getting karma,
Have used multiple to do apps and found the ui and functionality offered by todoist best suited,
"Finally, a real, full-featured to do list",
Great thing to sync different folders with different group...!,
I am finding it increadibly helpful and easy.,
What I have been looking for!,
Great free productivity tool which integrates so well with GMail,
I Actually Complete Things Now,
Not as good as mac desktop app,
I still procrastinate,

And getting better every time!,
Great way to keep a to do list pretty easy to use!,
"Finally, I'm organized!",
Download - sign up - unknown error - uninstall,
Love that it integrates everywhere and works the way I do...,
"Great interface, and very intuitive.",
"Have tried them all, this is by far my favorite!",
I have used many apps for task managing and productivity and this is the best one yet,

Enjoyed using it,
Perfect for my staying organized,
Gains on gains,
Really simple Project management app,
Recommended,
Considering going premium,
love the interface and the widget,
Sometimes updates don't save.,
What is the point of a dark theme (noir) if the background of the todos still are white? Ridiculous,
Please make cheaper subscription.,
Very  good  software  and  very  helpful.,
This app is what I have been looking for!,
Easy to use but powerful!! Designed to achive common goals.....,
"Nexus 6 with Android M.  ""Add a Task"" closes the app (no crash).",

La recomiendo para los amantes de los To do lists. He probado más de una app y esta se ajusta a lo que necesitaba.,
Muito bom,
More colors,
Realmente é útil e prático.  Eu uso somente para tarefas diárias tanto no trabalho quanto pessoal. É um super bloco de anotações de tarefas. E também para tarefas recorrentes como cobranças e pagamentos.,
Mrs.,
Like it,
"Ridiculous piece of junk app. I simply wanted to do a basic task of creating a list of apps I like and intended to add to it when necessary, yet this stupid app only guves you the option of setting reminders. So I tried putting the end of the year as a date so I could edit the list until then but the task list just disappeared after I clicked save. It did this 4 times so I gave up and uninstalled. Utterly frustrating.  Oh to top it off they expect 29.99 a year for preium features ARE THE CRAZY!!!",
"The capacity for four nested collapsible levels in each project a key GTD-friendly feature. The due date and priority sorting features are very good as well. I went Premium after a couple of months for access to completed tasks and the notes feature. Undo feature only seems to show up briefly after completing a task; would be nice to have a menu item undo. Syncs well across web, Droid, PC. Pleasing interface. The ""karma"" point system and categories make the app stickier.",
"I did a lot of research on to do list apps and this one seemed to meet all my needs, it has enough features but not too many to be bloated, some minor tweaks on a few things would make it better but it's a great app",
I have looked at a lot of to do apps. I haven't found one that works this well with both my phone and the computer. I really wish that it was better in terms of things like repeating tasks. For example I don't want to see my next week task that I have to take out the trash until next week. The interface is also a little clumsy in the way that it allows you to organize things. I would much prefer to be able  hopefully this app or some other app like it will make these changes and make me happier.,
"I've used Remember The Milk, Astrid, Google Tasks, Wunderlist, and Toodledo, but all pale in comparison. Todoist has managed to build an incredibly rich feature set into a very well-organized and elegant cross-platform app. My only request is if they'd support creating list items from Gmail messages like they do on the desktop, then this will be my holy grail todo app.",
"There will never be a perfect ToDo app,  we users are way to grumpy,  we want one single app to do everything and there's always this little thing that we would like the developers to add and then it's gonna be perfect.  No,  but really,  the only thing that I need in order go give Todoist 5 stars is a view pane for task notes as well as a task notes preview on mouseover.  That's all I ask, I moved to Todoist from OmniFocus and Asana,  I guess that's showing how much I like the Todoist.",
wow. I hated any.do so long i managed to find todoist to find that its too great to beleive its true. Amazing. All the features i needed in native GUI on android even in chrome extension without stupid and slow animations. I will pay gladly for this.  Thanks!,
There is no field for task description. There is only a subject line. Very inconvenient. Being able to add task description is a basic feature but in this app it's only made available with paid for premium service. Not useful to me.,
"Great solution that integrates with everything I need. Phone, tablet, Outlook, Chrome. Outlook add-in has great functionality. Does not use Outlook native tasks, but has its own panel. More power, manage projects,  and frees up Outlook tasks for email management. Love it!",
"Love that I can create all sorts of lists for home projects or tasks to do and have it accessible on my phone, tablet or computer.",
"Even the free version of this service is exceptionally useful, and the UI is intuitive. I've found it much easier to stay on top of all the little stuff in my life since I started using this app.",
"This is the easiest way to plan for ANYTHING.  After a few minutes fiddling with the program, I had set up my projects due for the next few weeks. Very straightforward and easy to use, from the get go.",
this is the best task management application that I have seen till date. it has all the features I could ask for and the cross platform support is best.,
"I had the pro version for a while. As a list it works well and has nice features.  The karma thing put me off some, but mostly  I'm not a list person.",
"It's a pretty good to do list implementation. It's missing some important features like the ability to actually set whether you want a task to repay after 1 day or every day when finished. You also can't set when your day ends. However, the basic features work well, and it had good categorization features.",
This is what I wanted for long long time.  If we can add feature to allocate tasks to others that will be icicng on cake. But even without  this feature it still is extremely great app for productivity management.,
I use Todoist for everything but it gives me a very hard time when I want to check my calendar to confirm my availability for a meeting that's beyond 7 days!,
I use this every day and it has become a vital part of my kit. The ability to have location based to-do's and the karma are all fantastic ideas. The new material design adds to it too. Combine this with the fact it works everywhere on everything is the icing on the cake.,
The Outlook add in is fantastic.  It allows you to set up thanks that you can take on any device or accessed via Internet.  You can also create a task from an email.,
"I love its simplicity, yet powerfulness and freedom in viewing tasks from different perspectives. The app is nice, fast, pleasure to work with and allows me to stay on top of my daily tasks.",
Todoist is getting things done. There is nothing more.,
"I use this app in a simple way. When I know I need to remember to do something, I can click the td+ link from the notifications menu on my smartphone. Back at my office, I access the list from the chrome add on and click when the task is done. I am sure the app does a lot more than this, but if all you are looking for is really easy way to manage lists between devices, this will serve you well",
"So far since I been using the app for about a week.  I've enjoyed the ease of importing task and how it easily translate to my calendar. I would like the option on a certain task to input a location so that I could automatically pull up with my GPS ,or cross reference with my contacts.",
This by far the best app of it's kind that I have tried. They are constantly improving it. It works great with Gmail. The Android app is simple and quick. I have found a home.,
Was looking for an app so that my husband and I could collaborate and get things done. It's proven to be extremely useful and I like that it's available on many platforms.,
The more I use it the more I like it.  The free version is so amazing its hard to believe its free.,
I use todoist every day to bring order into a chaotic PhD life,
"Perfect tool for what it does.  My idea of great software. Intuitive, simple and good at it's role and job.",
It just fit in. Simple and clean. I've try others and Todoist is the best,
A really good app but needs some changes with the workflow to become better.,
Good task app. Especially the recurring tasks.,
"Love it and would gladly pay one time fee for it, but it's a somewhat pricey subscription.",
Listed in the top ten to do mobile apps out there most of which I have used in the past.,
I've tried these to-do apps for long time. #1 todoist #2 any.do #3 wunderlist. Love the todoist's web accessibilty,
I love the flexibility & reminders. Color coding my different projects is an added bonus.,
Syncs with all my devices. Love the ability to indent to itemize all sub-tasks.,
The UI is terrible and is taking forever to update to material design,
Pretty good app. Wish it could do things like grocery lists too. Maybe the fully paid version can?,
It works for what I wanted. Simple and organized like this app a lot,
I needed something easy peasy is for my tasks and I loved this. I will move to pro version,
But a great app for the organizationally impaired,
Really easy to use and it works as described! Just what I was looking for.,
"Easy, intuitive, integrates well with Outlook as well as accessible via app or web.",
I love this ap! Keeps me on track everyday.,
There are no and todoist team does nothing to get done this desired feature many wants,
It always reminds me when I have something else to do,
This app really helps me to keep all  organized,
Simple to use across devices. Very nice!,
"Cross platform, ability to view as projects and inbox as well as due dates, like ""today"" and ""Next 7 days"".",
"Clean, powerful, and functional, this is well worth the $4 per month.",
Good but most of the common features in premium mode..,
Lot of features including reminders are available only in the premium plan which will cost you $$$. Going back to wunderlist.,
Thank you for the great app and the great support and bug fixes.,
Simple and efficient way of prioritizing,
Best app to track you todos,
Easy to use. Slick,
App does everything it promises to do,
Would be a 5 if you could view old tasks,
Great functionality!,
Best note taking app,
Great GTD app,
Great app for tracking tasked,
So bad,
Smart and easy,
Awesome app,
Great app,
Loved it,
"I went for a month's Premium trial and have to say, delighted with it. I was getting fed up of Any.Do bugs but transferring to Todoist had been pretty seemless. Have added Chrome extension, Gmail extension and Outlook plugin and love them. I'm already more productive but then that's sometimes the joy of having a new to do app! :-)",
"It's helped me massively in keeping track of everything I need to do, personal, business, client work. And I felt that my productivity has gone up using this. I have tried a few other solutions including Google keep. This one just works. I have the paid subscription which is fairly cheap for the value it offers. Great stuff todoist!",
One of those few things missing is the ability to use project as part of the filtering parameters. E.g. sometimes I want to filter tasks that belong to a certain project and has the context @home or @office. [14/4/15] It has this annoying bug where the notes count for a task is either wrong or not shown at all. Deducting one star.,
Tried the free trial of premium and found myself using the features constantly. Love making subtasks.  They make me think about what exactly needs to happen instead of being vague.  The karma graph is really useful for self accountability.,
Short term it works well.   I am still learning it's capabilities. Does not appear much different than most simular apps.   Will report back in a couple weeks.,
"Love the way todoist operates in the same way in a browser, outlook, desktop, and phone.  It also does a great job of integrating with other apps.",
"In the sea of to do list apps out there, Todoist stands out for its awesome collaborative features and incredibly simple interface. Great app.",
Works well with ITTT. Great interface and very easy to use. I also like how you can create sub-tasks. Great work guys.,
"I use Onenote for everything, but have totally switched to this for my To Do Lists.  Clean, easy to use.  We'll done.",
"Some additional functionality,  and maybe I've missed them,  eg printing; sorting.  Annoying that sometimes it is easy to mark a something as done and then depending on which platform can be a pain to undo",
Easily manage to do lists across all devices.   I would give it 5 but I'm not using it to its full potential,
The title speaks for itself. Definite must have,
Although still think premium is too expensive for a to-do application.,
"Loved this app. I'm,currently putting on several events on my campus so it helps A LOT with collaboration",
"This app is absolutely essential to my daily functioning. I have tried ALL the other to-do list apps for Android and Todoist is the best by far. Best UI/UX, tons of features, and integration with other apps. Love it.",
The app is great... I just wish time could be allocated to each task.... I think many people think like I do as soon as they start using it.,
"Very useful and user friendly.  I use it mainly for work. I like the fact that I can group tasks by project, assign priorities, etc.  I highly recommend it.",
I had been using Evernote for my to-do list but I couldn't manage the dates and times relationally like I can with TD. TD has become one of my top five apps!,
Makes to-do lists. You check them off. Access from computer to if you need to. Lots of options for organizing things. Easy peasy!,
"Love the app, and great response time on the update! This app (and program in general) has been a great help to staying organized and productive!",
"It's got everything you need, it's fast and full of features. Does what it says.",
Finally a to do list that actually helps me do what I do. Now I feel more organized and accomplished.,
The only thing that this app needs is material design. That will make this app the perfect one.,
Very effective to-do list/task manager. It has a clean interface that's easy to use and also works seamlessly with a bunch of other useful apps. I really like the Gmail and Togl integration!,
This seems like a great app very powerful but easy to use.,
Has all the features I want in a clean easy interface.,
"Really, that is the best ToDo app I ever used. Except for couple of bugs, perfect!",
Thanks,
I like having the ability to categorize tasks and enter tasks quickly.,
Does what it's supposed to.,
Use it everyday! Great for Productivity and staying focused on the tasks!,
"Good app. I enjoy using it, keep up the good work.",
Does a great job with reminders,
"Great for those never ending....""To Do Lists""",
Should have everything in a free version,
Gets the job done!,
So helpful!,
Really Good,
"Please, make sorting tasks in the application, as in the web version.     Пожалуйста, сделайте сортировку задач в приложении, как в веб версии.",
Love it,
Best of them all,
Clean and easy to use,
Great little program,
Excellent App,
Nexus 5,
Does the job,
"Todoist is a very functional to do app. It provides almost everything fans of to do apps have come to expect. This might be it's biggest problem : it offers the industry standard and little more. This is a disappointment as it has the canvas to offer so much more. Increasing collaborative features and the integration with productivity apps and storages will increase its performance. Todoist, like many of its counterparts, suffers from a bland design. It could improve on these and almost touch greatness :-)",
ToDoist is the kind of app any person should have for organizing his life. The premium version works just perfectly and makes me ale to do lots of things otherwise I wouldn't even remember to do.,
"This is what I've been looking for. Todoist has the right blend of settings/features and minimalism. I love subordinately related tasks and projects,but the custom queries for your start page sold me. I can tweak my start page to show me what I need to do today.",
"i had to manually go through 250 tasks to identify unsynced items. but still I stayed with todoist as this is the only app that has manual rearangement of tasks AND has subtasks, tags, etc. another thing that is not perfect: manual rearrangement of task would be the most meaningful for priorities. especially, to pull the most urgent / important tasks to the very top of all tasks that have priority 1. but thats not possible...",
"I like this app as it allows me to tick things off when they are done and sends reminders to my inbox as well. Some functions not as intuitive or  user friendly but once u get used to it, the app is a great assistant!",
Very helpful with centralizing tasks and working off of a list. The notifications of items due and productivity charts are helpful and provide incentives for staying on task.,
I have tried most of the to do task apps and this one is the one I am sticking with since it does one thing and it does it really well. It is also very easy to quickly add tasks from the drop down bar,
I started to use it for small tasks and it help me with my realibility a lot. I would appreciate integration with exchange (tasks and calendar). I am think about use in team and it would be really helpfull if I can send task ti other task management systems.,
"Only thing it lacks is the ability to collapse sub-lists in the widget as displaying everything expanded makes the list too long to scroll. No complaints though, beautiful, fast, and simple to use.",
I have been looking for a simple task manager that can help me manage my day better. Todoist is a perfect solution for me so far.,
"Prior to this app, I tried: GTASK, Google Keep, Evernote, One Note and others. They just can't compete with this tool. It works across platforms (interacts perfectly with my iPad and MAC and my Motorola 360. Great email alerts and auto generated reports to keep me honest on my ability to complete tasks. Just an excellent tool!",
The tool is well thought of and help in coordination and task assignments beyond tracking your tasks.,
I can make it integrate with my GTD system by using labels. It is available on all the platforms that I use.,
"Subscription lapsed. Now I can't save new tasks. A menu constantly prompts me to upgrade when I try to save a new task. I click the ""later"" option,  but the task doesn't save. Had notes in premium and now can't access them. Absurd.",
This app is great! It's very organized and easy to follow. You can also see up and coming projects for the week or for the day. The karma points also make you want to follow it and it feels rewarding to actually do the work and stay organized!  I would recommend this app!,
"I haven't tried any other agenda software, so I don't have a basis for comparison.",
"Everything this app does, is simply Awesome. Been using it since last 4 months.",
"Have been using ToDoist for over a year. Bought the premium subscription and for the most part has worked well. Just updated to 7.1.1 on my phone and now it is randomly adding 11:59pm to task that I have not assigned a time to. Even after editing, it is still adding 11:59pm but only for some tasks. I do not see why it is occurring for some and not others. Makes it impossible to order tasks as I want. Please fix!",
Great to use as a brain dump and star doing things one by one,
Keeps me very well organized.  The widget is very useful as well,
"I'm only just beginning to use this app,  but so far it's amazing.",
Tried out several. This was the best.  Sub lists.  Priorities.  Synchs with desktop and phone.,
"Wonderful app, actually makes keeping organized less work.",
My go to app for GTD. usable on all my devices.,
Have helped me to organize my tasks. Thanks developer.,
Support is quick.,
Excellent clean app which does everything it needs to do.,
I love this app!,
Great way to plan your days ahead,
Very good app to organise your life,
all features need to pay for them to work,
Наилучшее приложение из всех todo,
Can't live without it.,
Nice,
Brilliant,
"Needs more options & features, for example such as persistent reminders, etc. Premium subscriber. P.S. Crashes on reminder date picker since the recent update.",
"So clean, and simple. Coupled with the desktop applications incredibly powerful and simple free app.",
"There are too many things I like about Todoist to say in this short review. The ease of use and minimalist approach is perhaps in the top of my list. The fact that they provide documentation of their API is perhaps the cherry on top. But it's not perfect, at least in my eyes. It needs a darker UI both in the app and the widget. And the fonts in the widget need to be smaller, or at least give the option to make it so.",
"IMPORTANT -- this will only make you as productive as you make it.  Their setup of using due dates as ""planned dates"" is highly frustrating IMO and can quickly get you unproductive and behind -- but if you sketch out a system before even picking up the app, their filters and Boolean logic combined with beautiful and easy to read formatting make this the killer application.",
I have tried more to do list apps that I care to admit. This is the only one I have stuck with for more than a couple weeks. I am really enjoying and have convinced others to join. I think it could have some additional features that would be more helpful. Syncing with Outlook tasks would be very helpful. More reporting options to see past performance would be nice. The ability to see tasks on a calendar would be awesome.,
"Top notch interface on the app and on the web. This is, hands down, the best todo application for me. That lists are broken into projects and tasks can have subtasks really lets you set up task points for projects the way that real projects happen. Todoist plays a huge role in my days at work.",
"Love the app - simple, clean, intuitive and enough fully-featured even for quite complex GTD setups. More importantly it is truly ubiquitous with all its non-android counterparts. Would like to see some more advanced features like parent task being automatically completed once all the children task are ticked off for a 5 star rating.",
"It gets the job done.  Make a list, group tasks, schedule due dates, assess status, get reminders.  Its just not super sophisticated. I wish it had parent/child tasks or the ability to reuse previous tasks.  I wish I could have set up a Christmas list or a grocery list and tied it to my task for example. But again, for basic to dos, it works just fine.",
"Great flexibility with filters.  the fact that you can make sub lists. Could be improved if the project could be tabs for easy switching, and if you could add one more point of prioritization, such as a star to label easy tasks that are quick to do. Being able to sync from your device is fantastic. The only other feature I could want would be the ability to make a calendar that you could export to Google calendars with your tasks for the week.",
"Strikes a good balance between free and premium features, leaving a fully functional task tracking app at no cost.   Online integration works well, meaning a consistent experience across devices. Keeps things simple, which makes it very usable.   PC ""app"" is functional enough, but I personally dislike ""standalone"" chrome apps, so no major dramas there ☺",
"1. In android, Tasks should start with a check box for checking it to indicate the status ""Completed""; a tick sign at the bottom ( to mark it  completed) is confusing. 2. Tasks may have a description field to elaborate it for easy understanding of others; to whom it is assigned. 3. Rich User Interface for a gorgeous look may make it elegant. 4. Some default Labels may be added to make the app more productive.",
Sharing of tasks inside a project needs to be added. For example in one project there may be 10 tasks. But I need to share only 4 of them to one of my team members. Rest 6 are irrelevant to him. So share or collaborate option should be introduced at task level also.I expected this in premium version but not found. Please upgrade urgently.,
"I would really enjoy a simpler format to checking off the tasks. To explain further, I mean reformatting the check off system by making a box by the task and then when it's checked, the task is faded out, and then you can uncheck it if need be, and the task could stay until the due date pasts. This just seems easier for the user for consumers, and I believe that the coding for the feature wouldn't be too difficult. Thanks for your consideration, Allen Wells",
"I like it very much. Just like exactly I needed. Out of all task organizer,  this is surely one of the best. However, I am quite disturbed whenever I need to make a subtask. It's quite awful since I couldn't determine easily which task actually it roots from.  Whenever I made new substask, I couldn't directly link the subtask to any root task. The only good way is by adding subtask from the main task. However, it's quite frustrating when I need to write task fast. As verdict, I would recommend this app.",
"I've tried many apps to get organized and all came up short in some major way. Todoist is the only one I've found that really works for me. Making an email into a task saves me so much time. I would like to see a way to copy a task with subs to another project.  Also, I wish that project structure wouldn't flatten when filtering by label. But overall, a very useful and useable tool.",
"I never write reviews and this was not solicited. Its just so well done, I wanted to. Its THE list/notepad/organizer I've always hoped for. I've downloaded (many) prior apps; only to be disappointed by convoluted, limited, and/or unreliable performance. And although there is a pay version, the free version is generous about the amount of accessible features. Its fully functional. And I'm more prone to consider paying for the upgrade when the free version is so terrific. Other developers ought to learn that.",
"I really wanted a list that would allow me to make descriptive notes, like a shopping list. I can't seem to do that on here, so the best I can do is make a reminder to shop, then use paper or another app to remember what I was supposed to get. Kinda lame, but everything else is pretty good.",
"As a graduate student in a data analysis heavy field. As a happily married man whose wife works. As a father of three year old abd three month old. As member of the LDS church who spends 8 hours a week on volunteer work for my church. This app keeps me focused and on task. Love the app. Seriously, once I graduate I am going to make so much money because this app makes me so productive.",
"This is the most simple app of todolist apps out there. I've tried numerous and they're very slow, complicated and frustrating at some point. It has a desktop version too. Try it and see the way it changes your productivity.",
"See EDIT, reply is deceptive! Do NOT pay for this. They lie when they say it syncs with google calendar, they have been offered Google's api AND support, yet refuse to integrate as they wish to compete. Terrible!  EDIT: The reply from ToDoist is exactly what I'm talking about. There is no integration, updates from ToDoist to Google Calendar are done once daily, and are limited. Google literally offered their API when ToDoist was lying about Google preventing integration. VERY, deceptive!",
"I was initially skeptical of this app but checked it out because of the IFTTT integration. Must say this app has kept me on task. Really like the ease with which tasks can be grouped by project. Cross-platform support is an added benefit, but the Outlook plugin is essential and where I get the most benefit. This app will keep you tied in with everything you load through other platforms.",
"I used to use Google Keep (which is great), its just that Todoist is better.  One reason I picked Todoist is because of the videos on their website, and their extensive online help. I was going to pay the $29 for the app just cause its more than worth it. I dont really need the extra functionality, but the author did such a good job, he deserves the money.I use this app daily.",
"Love the app. I use it in the advertising industry and we have tons of deadlines always so this is great to keep track of my to do. The only thing I suggest is allowing for more colors when choosing the level of importance for items. (right now it's white, baby blue, blue, red)  maybe add some additional options in colors like purple and orange, etc.",
Apparently I hadn't heard it enough.  Using outlook simply didn't work.  The website and the app are well organised and elegant easy to learn and works brilliantly.  The integration with so many other apps and tools was a no brainer for me opening up so many possibilities.  I'm enlightened now with the importance of writing things down.,
"I realize that probably sounds very dramatic, but something about this application and my new habit of prioritizing my day (as the first part of my day) is making changes in my life. I don't know if it's the Karma score that makes a game out of it, but I'm finding my life focused more and more. First to do app I've stuck too. Well designed and implemented exceptionally.",
Won't let you write notes (an essential part of these types of apps) without paying for the premium version...which is very overpriced and based on a yearly sub ($28.99 per year). A sad case of a nice app that adheres to price gouging and subscription pricing.,
Especially when Google keep is free and my phone I don't have to type everything in I just say ok Google remind me..and edit of course sometimes but when I arrive at the place or its due my phone reminds me. I had hoped this would integrate thru devices better and remind me as it was due but in the free version u can't even trial the features that may make it stand out upon keep and evernote. I don't care for the sample they care to share so I wont pay for a bigger piece of useless pie.,
"As much as I don't like having my whole life be on the internet, todoist is great because it really helps you stay on top of what you need to be doing (or keeps you from pretending everything is fine when you have been avoiding a task that was due months ago). Plus it's beautiful.",
I was a Astrid lover and since yahoo killed that awesome product I have been lost in a pursuit for a replacement in the same level. Todoist made me feel confortable again. The natural way to enter the deadlines is the innovation that I liked most. I just didn't find enough reason to move to the paid version yet.,
"I've been using todoist for less than a week, and I'm already in love. The color coded priority levels, project breakdown, and access across many platforms sold me. Well, not really since I'm using the free version...But I might pay to get reminders. Anyway it's great for managing classes as a college student but also for things like grocery lists and new songs to check out. Highly recommend the Mac app as well as the chrome extension. Paired with the chrome Toggl extension, you can track your time per task",
"Suggestion. Maybe there could be like x button for things that havent been done today and it is too late to do them tomorrow. For example some things need to be done every day. If I don't do one today, tomorrow I can do it only once, not twice. Medication for instance. I can't take two because I forgot to take one yesterday. Now my only option is to check it like its done so todoist would remind me again. And it counts it like a comleted task which it isn't. But app is absolutely great. Keep up the goodwork",
Its affordable (more than most) and has an incredible amount of options I am never without access. Sharing folders is quick and easy and a huge boon for sharing shopping lists for example. Todoist has transformed my productivity.,
"Over all, a good app. Would like to see more functionality for the Android Wear app. The Wear app can't  pull To Do lists from the phone app. Only items that a due today are sent automatically to the watch. The phone app can send all To Do items to the watch (if you tap a button) but, if an item is changed on the phone/tablet/computer, the change is not synced to the watch.",
I love that its available on so many devices. Works well for me... however the sub tasks are really confusing..a sync to Google tasks would be really helpful... but most importantly reminders are very limited if there at all in free version! This is an awesome app but if you need custom reminders try something else...,
The application is doing what it does really well. I still can't justify going premium  but the features might be worth it. I especially like the fact that it has an app for pretty much every platform out there.,
I think the app and service are great. My only complaint is that some common actions like editing an existing task require too much time to begin. A long press followed by clicking an icon. But other than that knit picking thing I really like it.,
"In my search for the best implementation of the GTD methodology I stumbled upon this app.  It certainly is the best. What makes it so good is the extensive range of cross platform applications that you get with a  single subscription;a host of excellent APIs (try the outlook one, it's excellent );advanced filtering;and excellent customer support.  Oh also, it's the 'cleanest'  looking app out there, at least in my opinion.",
"I don't normally rate apps but love this one. I've tried other to do GTD apps before and while they helped they were often cumbersome to use. This time I downloaded 6 or 7 apps to try but feel in. Love With todoist. It is simple, elegant and effective.  I love how there is an easy widget for quickly entering things that come to mind. I feel so much more organized now  than ever before. I'm using it with  Sunrise app where my tasks, calendar, Facebook etc are all synced into the one interface.  Fabulous.",
"Well made app with a good work flow. Only gripe is that if you assign a task a project but not a due date, it can easily be forgotten since it will not show up in the two most common views.",
I really love the gmail integration. I can finally empty my inbox and set reminders for emails through todoist. And the ctrl-shift-t is an awesome way to add anything as a todo. Edit:i continue to use it as a premium user of course,
This application is way better than remember the milk I've been using this application from few months now and I can easily see the difference. I would recommend this application to anyone who wants to get the work done and is looking for up an all-in-one application to manage his stuff on a daily basis with multiple projects.,
"I've tried a few task manager apps, this seems to be the best one for my way of working. App syncs to website, to chrome extension...  Perfect. Notes being a premium feature is irritating but the free premium trial convinced me it was worth it.",
It is a dealbreaker for me.  They don't even provide a decent built-in calendar. So if you rely on a calendar (especially Google Calendar) this app is not for you.  Yes they have some workaround that refreshes the Google calendar once a day or so. But to their customers they blame Google for not enabling two way sync. That is a 100% LIE and I do not like companies that LIE to their customers. Nozbe works perfectly with Google Calendar. Insightly too. Perhaps their software engineers can't figure it out and blame Google - and the  support staff buys their provably lame excuse.  or perhaps they are too busy working on Karma points - a really weak and pointless goal tracking system. Sorry ToDoist - I keep a schedule. I have appointments - I use a calendar. To me more important than gamification of my todo list.  It is really too bad because otherwise it is my favorite app. That's why I'm upset. They work hard on a great interface and then toss it in the toilet because they don't think people's calendars are more important than adding  games.  Priorities are seriously askew.  But hey maybe their market is not people with serious business to do.,
"Just switched to Android & had to find an alternative to Omnifocus. Todoist is beautiful & the free app is pretty useful, but if you want to view all tasks (not just 7 days) in order of date, you'll have to pay the yearly fee for the premium upgrade, then create a custom filter. I wish I didn't have to pay for this basic functionality, but I will for now.  UPDATE: The Premium app is totally worth the money, & the license works across multiple devices. Also, their support team is very responsive.",
"Just 1 thing missing. We can not set task frequency customised. In our company maintenance and production work we need to repeat task at random day. Say we have to do some task every after 17 days or 22 days,  but ur app allows to repeat after a wk or daily or monthly. Pl add this features to repeat task at customised days",
"I did my research. Todoist is the only one of its kind that boasts impressive, dynamic apps for both Android and Mac OS. I need an app that syncs between my devices, allows me to have many projects and sub projects and tasks, set due dates, times, and priorities, create tasks from my email inbox (by forwarding the email to the project), allows multiple assignees/users, and most importantly has an option to view all tasks due that day across my projects. I upgraded to the $3/mo plan, and couldn't be happier.",
"The website and app combination run my day, whether I'm using my computer in the office or on site, or doing volunteer/ametuer sports administration. The features allowing easy programming of repeating tasks are superb.",
Most apps are great for tasks but not for projects or they're great for projects and too complex for simple to do lists. Or the app is amazing but only on one platform. Ugh! Todoist does everything! I use it for simple shopping lists to building proposals where there are many tasks and people under one project who can communicate through the app. Best of all I have it on my Mac and android. Sucks to pay for features but it's cheaper and more affective than most other paid project apps.,
Downloaded free version of this to keep track of uni assignments and projects. Having separate categories helps keep everything clear in my mind. If it isn't written here; it doesn't exist! Liking the add on for Gmail but would appreciate being able to move emails to the to do list instead of having to retype everything. Can't justify paid upgrade at the moment and don't seem to really need it. Functionality is great. Daily email reminders also fantastic.,
"This program is available in so many platforms that you do not have an excuse for getting things done.   It has the concepts of GTD built in.  And I love the Karma email, it keeps me motivated.   Great job!   Great program!",
"Great program, quick and pretty deep. I am not quite sure why I am not giving it 5 stars, but there's something missing. Some of the ideas in this app, such as the productivity karma system are actually groundbreaking... but something is missing. Not sure what it is. I'll write in to the devs if I think of something.",
"I've used a lot of to do list wrangling tools, so far I've stuck with this one the longest. The app is better than the web tool, which has the odd surprising glitch but is by and large pretty robust, pretty usable and visually very appealing.",
"Todoist is the best task management software currently available on any platform. You'll find yourself incorporating more and more areas of your life into the program and feeling accomplished and energized you complete a task and boost your karma! Todoist still has plenty of bugs, which can be frustrating at times, but the customer support is friendly, helpful, and responds quickly. Accessing the full suite of features requires a yearly fee, but most users won't even need the extra features.",
"Am really liking this system so far, it makes getting organised fun. There are some interface issues though, it's not that easy to navigate intuitively. Sorting the tasks and finding them again does not come as easily as it should.",
"I agree with Aaron--the only thing lacking is the ability to add more hours to the day! This is an extremely flexible and useful productivity organizer. It's great for those with ADD and those who simply have tons of competing demands that they need to and prioritize (e.g. every parent!). I thought it would be a slightly useful gimmick, but I've found it to be incredibly useful and beneficial. I get more done with less stress. How great is that?",
"Really enjoying this so far, and love the ability to manage from both the phone app and web browser. Only issue I've had so far is the app frequently suggesting it sets the time zone, even though I keep saying 'Yes' to the suggestion - weird.",
I like the offline capability it's very convenient for me. One thing that bugs me is that it has a server side timezone configured and if I use todoist both on my phone and computer and have different timezones it always prompts me to flip server configuration to current device configuration.,
"Really like this app, use it for hw and daily task but its widget could really use a new design! I think the app looks fine but personally I like minimalistic widget interfaces, that flow with whatever theme or background your using. More importantly, this application gets the job done!",
"In 3 days, I just got SO much more productive. I used to hate using digital formats for my tasks. All the other apps I tried were never intuitive or thoughtful enough and I'd get way too distracted using them. So I started writing tasks down on paper instead. Eventually I'd misplace the paper or lose track of items if they were postponed... Todoist is amazing. Get the premium version and sync it up with Sunrise calendar. And add the widgets for both to your home screen(s). Then you'll see what I mean.",
"Started using it at the recommendation of Dottotech.   Link it with Evernote and Sunrise Calendar.  Works well, and has become my daily base for scheduling and task management now.   Suggestion: Please have a page in Settings for Defaults eg. I would like to select a Default Project instead of Inbox, and a default time eg 0900 next day Suggestion for time settings: include 24hour clock military style without dividers eg 1700 or 17 = 5pm. rather than 17:00 Suggestion: offer world wide time based on UTC/GMT for international collaboration (may be already there, but I am only in one time zone, so I haven't searched for it yet) and a default time zone setting which may be different to computer TZ/Locale settings. John from Melbourne Victoria Australia",
"Gorgeous app that works like I do and flexible enough to handle changes as they arise (project deadlines, etc) Always settled for other apps and never really kept up with my demands.  So happy to say this one delivers form AND function! If ant beta testers are needed down the road county me in! KUDOS",
"Nice interface, amazing features, endless multiple platform, reminders are great,integrates with many apps, I'm just starting but sure the karma thing will give me a boost of motivation,  and premium is worth the money, definitely five stars. I suggest to include the end date option if left empty start date act's as due date, also a button next to the tasks to mark as ""in progress"". Thanks a lot guys :)",
"Unlike most task extensions, this one actually adds functionality to the browser. When working on schoolwork, I can add task on the fly without having to keep an extra tab or program open. Functionality is actually very high for an unpaid app, especially with the ability to have on nearly any device you can imagine. The manager itself is also very fast and intuitive, with many keyboard shortcuts to get around with little mouse usage. With separate ""projects"" I can actually integrate all my calendars and task managers into one place. Great way to remind yourself about bills, things at the store, etc. After trying 5-7 task managers and calendar apps, this one won the spot on my favorite icon bar of my phone.",
"Took me away from Wunderlist after using Todoist for only a few days. The free version was very impressive. After going pro, I cannot imagine working/living without Todoist! Seriously keep up the great work.  I have a few feature requests - one would be a Boolean operator that let's youf filter for all tasks with any label. Right now you can only search for specific labels or nor label...unless maybe I am missing something in my filter. Could be the case ha.",
"It doesn't has any notification Window, any sound o something that can warring you about task",
I've only used ToDoist for a couple of weeks now so I still feel like I am learning how to best utilize it for my use cases.   One feature I would like is to have the ability to set a specific time for certain tasks and then be reminded at that time.,
"My boss recommended this app, and since I've really started using it  I've been much more focused and organized. She's a clever motivator!  I've tried several other GTD-inspired list managers, but todoist's multi-platform consistency and efficient UI have been the special ingredients I needed. The one (nitpicky) complaint I have is that creating a subtask takes 3 taps. Editing a task, for example, takes only 2, and I need to create new subtasks far more often than I edit existing entries.",
Great app! Very useful and SIMPLE! Beats every other app I've tried so far. The only thing that's missing is the option to set tasks to repeat weekly but I'm assuming that's for the premium version? Wished it was a FREE feature :( Definitely would of given 5 stars if it was :),
The repeating tasks function is why I selected this program. I have lots to do each day and many are repeaters. This program makes it a breeze to keep up with all of them. It is also very flexible in which days and times can be set. It's a keeper!,
"Compare the premium features of this to free features of Wunderlist. If Wunderlist fits all your needs, then chose that, because it's an excellent choice. Otherwise go for this app and go with premium. There really is no in between, unless the interface is a deal breaker for you one way or the other.",
"I was a long-time user of Astrid until Yahoo killed it for no obvious reason. So, I tried other to do apps. Many are really good but none with broad ranging syncing capability and plug-ins that Todoist has. Along with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, I have the Samsung Gear S which is based on the Tizen OS.  I'd like to see an Tizin based app like the Google Wear app. Since I am trying to adopt the GTD methodology,  I  request deeper alignment with GTD or more instructional information and videos on how to use Todoist with GTD. Also,  I changed my priority colors. My priority 2 filter didn't change on existing or new tasks. But I really dig this tool.",
I would definitely like it to be integrated with my Google calendar. That's the only feature I am missing right now. Otherwise this app is awesome where you can add task via widget on the go and even schedule it.,
Downloaded this app not too long ago and started using and my opinion is that this is one of the more complete n user friendly app. All data is saved in their cloud server so even if one need to change to a new phone or has to carry out factory reset your data will not be lost for this I gave 5 stars. Keep up the good work and add more functions n features for free users please.,
"This has become my go to way of staying organized. Love the ease of adding tasks via mobile, wear, desktop, anywhere. Project and due date systems are very helpful as well as reminders. I would love to see an integration with a pomodoro timer. I have to use this in conjunction with my timer app (pomotodo). Really wish you guys could make it happen. Keep up the great work!",
"Firstly, it has annoying bugs, like it asks me repeatedly if I want to change my time zone to where I live, even though I say yes every time. On top of that, it requires a premium upgrade to do even elementary tasks, like getting reminders, and that costs $29 per year. For a to-do app, that's ridiculous.",
This is a good little app. It reminds me or Jira project managing software. You have have several to do lists. Each task can have as many subtasks as you like. They can also be set a priority level and can have date attached to them to be completed by. I would certainly recommend it.,
"Really like the everyday mails, the Gmail plugin is very handy.",
Only thing I'm hating on this app for is the lack of setting reminders on the free version. It is a to do list app after all.,
"If I have a specific task that I want to do everyday, I have to check it as completed first before it shows on the next day. But what if I missed a day?! Of course I have to pretend that it is completed by checking it as done so I can see it again on the next day. I hope there is a way to avoid this ""lie"" so users can analyse their daily routine more accurately.",
Simple interface. Intuitive. Syncing with other devices which are not on the Android platform is a breeze. Seriously one of the best apps out there. I have subscribed to the premium service while simultaneously unsubscribing from several other services that collectively  couldn't offer what Todoist can.,
"Great productivity app.  Like that it works across Google, Chrome,  and apple equipment.  Dissapointed that it won't work on iPad with is 7",
"Been using todoist for over 12 months from paper. The free version is awesome but the paid version is better. Multiplatform, fast, and good design... can't fault it and would recommend. Thanks todoist team",
"The minor goals (minimum tasks finished a day, etc) that you randomly hit and then the app gives you a little pop up - stupid, I know but it boosts my mood that little bit I need. Also, the convenience of having it on every platform I use (desktop, laptop, phone, internet) makes it ideal for me wherever I happen to plop down and work",
"Beautiful interface, great features (and I'm still discovering new ones!), intuitive programming. The Karma feature is actually working for me (thought it was a little lame at first, but it did some mind warp or something on me and I'm increasing productivity because of it!). I do find that when I go to move a task up in the list, it sometimes causes all things under it to get filed into it, but that's easily corrected.  Works great on my macbook and my android. Oh, and the customer service is super!",
This app does it all. The widget works perfectly for me and the ability to add tasks from your notification bar is an absolute life saver. I have tried many to do list apps and calendar apps and this one by far had helped me the most.,
"We use Todoist for our business and love it. The online extension used with the app just makes the work day so much smoother. I can task my employees on my days off so they still have things to do. The reminders are great, too!",
"Simple UI is both user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Offers a lot of customization options without making the app excessively clunky. However, right swipe accidentally deletes agenda way too easily, and the undo menu disappears too quickly.",
I love it for its ability to work across all of my platforms. It seems need to refine the details. It requires to many button presses to accomplish things.,
My only complaint is that it uses too much white space on the task list.   A more compact view would be nice.,
"I have tried them all and this is the most efficient, versatile and reliable calendar app around. And I say this after six months of intensive use on multiple platforms. Couldn't be more satisfied.",
This app does not allow sorting a list alphabetically - an obvious and easy feature.  It is therefore useless to me. Uninstalled.,
"Bought Premium.  Waste of money.  First go work vanished.  Had to redo everything.  Start Page never opens first.  Random pages open when you click on icon.  So, have to take several extra steps to track down ongoing projects. Figured it out.  Idiots set it up where when you are in a project and select ""Leave project"" the program deletes project without a warning.  Morons.  Who would use that terminology? Should be ""Close Out Project"" with warning that all work will vanish!!!  Worthless",
"Really useful app for my terrible memory self. It would be awesome if we could have a dark widget in the next update or something. Great job with this app, btw. :)",
"Love the option to add a task from the notification area, dragging tasks between days, swipe to complete and the ease of rescheduling tasks. A dark theme, and batch options for tasks are missing aspects though... The best I've used, almost perfect for my needs.",
"I tried a lot of apps before settling on this one. I even waited months before writing this review. But the more I use this app, the more I love it. I have been seriously less stressed this semester in grad school, and I attribute a lot of that to this app. I love the karma system and I love how on top of things I am able to be.",
Wish there was a way to pay monthly or bi yearly instead of the only option that is the whole year subscription for $30.  I love the app anyways.,
I have tried to use Google calendar for years but it was cumbersome to set up a task and repeat breaks if you change 1 date in the series... I am addicted to todoist now!,
"I've used MLO (too complicated and expensive) and G tasks (too basic) and tested Wunderlist,  Todledo, Any do. I settled for Todoist for clarity, filters, widget with context view, design, impeccable  sync, price and letting me taste premium for free. I am very happy with Todoist :-)",
"Would love to see creation of sub task before check mark on mobile, I have to drag the sub task to the right project after it's created. Also need a notes area on free version.",
I can only filter tasks by date via the website and not the app. No way to be able to filter by date on the app and the newest task added goes right to the bottom (out of date order) until I filter them by date on my computer. Very inconvenient.,
I've used it since last August and haven't stopped. I have a block schedule at school so knowing what I need to do to prepare comes in handy. I like using the website more though when it comes to adding tasks.,
"I chose this app because I like the presentation,I can see the whole name of the task, I can add sub tasks and they are visible,  and critically that I can reorganise the task list so I can put the more urgent items at the top. I'm surprised that it doesn't have it's own calendar (although that seems to be typical of these apps) but downloading Sunrise Calendars (free) with it works a treat. Haven't had time to look at the more advanced features yet.  The only reason I drooped a star, pushes not so quick.",
"I use this app on my chromebook and all my other devices, as a college student, I haven't been this productive since middle school!",
Fine for basic entry and reminder alerts. Not very intuitive as to how to check back on or view tasks already marked as completed.,
"It was really a good task organizer. I enjoy using it for a about a year. And it help me alot.  Before the mobile version I used the Web version, it is a real hand for me. I really recommend it",
I have looked for a to-do app that works for me for quite awhile. I like how lightweight the app itself feels and how quickly I can make tasks.,
No learning curve because it is so user intuitive. Runs across every device and program you need it to. Pay the 30.00 annual fee. You will have made the best investment for your productivity.,
"Those are must have features,  surprised that they are non existing here and deal breaker for me",
I would give  this  a 5 if I could delete only one occurance of a repeating task.  Otherwise it has met all my expectations.,
"I'm struggling between todo, wunder  & ticktick. I really like todoist's clean design and sub-project feature that the other 2 do not have. However, there are several critical defects: 1) sub-projects stay @ a viewing lvl, not really functional.  2) android app too basic, to be the worst among 3 apps. 3) too many basic functions need to go premium that are usually free features of other apps. 4) you do not have a choice to take monthly subscription, you have to go for at least 1 year.",
"Todoist is great. Notes feature should be made free, attachments as a premium feature is fine.",
And I've tried a lot of them! I had even switched back to paper with the Bullet Journal method... But this app has lured me back to digital. Beautiful interface and flawless functionality.,
One thing. Update DashClock extension so that I could not only see how many tasks I have to do but also what are those tasks.,
The new ios update and Android don't seem to talk to each other. You can see the timing in ios but not in Android. It's all screwed up in android version. It's also sad to see the removal of manually typing the timing for convenience.,
"It is a good task manager, but there are similar once for free. so I don't use this any more",
Allows you to have a shared folder of tasks. Great way to set reminders and make sure everything gets done.,
"I used to just use gmail calendar, but I find this app is great for all the random things that I have to do and supplements my calendar of regular activities. Entries are easy to dismiss and create compared to one that I tried a while ago.",
"Though somewhat less streamlined than any.do it is the perfect all around to do app and has the kind of robust categorization, reminders, and sharing capabilities that I've always dreamed of. Amazing.",
This is one of the best apps I've used to help keep productivity up. With the integration with mail it's on a whole new level. The only thing missing is meeting and phone call event links.,
I'm beginning to manage my heavy workload and you can download extra apps to create a more persoalised system.,
Only minor annoyance is the lack of start dates and the android interface that doesn't support longpress actions,
"While I do have some gripes, mostly that there could be better and more instructions, this is one of the better task managers out there. It would be nice to have Evernote integration though.",
Excellent free app. I live that it's across so many platforms. I use it on Firefox at work and it seems to be seamless between Firefox and Android.,
"Brain dumping into to do lists has increased my productivity and todoist is the best product out there (even just at the free level). ""Karma"" gamification was a good idea.",
"This fits great for personal task management workspace and after trying many apps, I would rate this one to be the best.",
"I use this app multiple times a day, and I have it installed on my phone and tablet. I use the widget on both devices, and though it usually works fine, sometimes it gets stuck on ""loading"" and won't show anything for days at a time. If they could fix that, it would add at least one more star to my review. (Also, it needs a ""compact"" view so each list entry isn't so huge.)",
Unless you start using it you will not be able to understand how useful it is. Don't go by ui their team is improving it to material design,
I really enjoy this app. It's really helpful being able to have projects to categorize the lists. Especially that you can choose the specific dates you want each item to pop up on. Makes my life much easier!,
Really am impressed  with the interconnectivity with other apps like Evernote Gmail  Google Calendar etc. Keep up the great work and IFTTT receipes.,
"I've been searching for an application that was flexible enough to keep up with my needs for quite a while.  While not perfect (no application is), this is by far the best I've found.",
I've tried many apps and this all comes down to this one being the best on the market. Only missing thing : liberty of colors towards priorities.,
"Easy to use, great customer support, and a solid app. Definitely worth downloading.",
I love the clean way it works on my pc through mozilla thunderbird and on gmail and on my Android phone.  It helps me stay on the case.,
"If you need something that works across platforms, look no further! Todoist has been a life-saver for me. Only complaint is that I don't like to be constantly reminded of the benefits of the premium subscription.",
"Love constant reminders for personal and business tasks, running the free version, haven't looked at the paid version yet.",
"I've tried literally dozens of to do apps over the years, and while there are many good ones, Todoist beats them all.",
"This app is awesome. Better than other so-called `productivity` apps that paradoxically eat up time and focus. Clean, simple, easy to use UI. Highly recommended.",
"My mother has a lollipop device,  and I have a jellybean device. If she adds a task on a project where I am also a collaborator,  I have to manually refresh todoist everytime. Fix this please..",
"Doesnt show # completed tasks for motivation, cant bulk assign tasks to projects, etc & £18/year to add notes is a bit steep.",
"I moved from Any.Do and I love the layout better. It's not too different, functionally, but it looks way better in my opinion. I'd love a dark theme but that's it.",
"This app send me mail of tasks every day, as if it were my mother when i was child：｝",
It's an easy way to keep everything organized and helps keep me on track.  I have adhd and it's easy to get distracted so using this keeps my life simple,
"When you have a lot of things to do, you need a way to manage those tasks as part of bigger project - Todoist is the way I manage my day-to-day, no matter if I'm on my Android phone, my iPad, Mac, PC, or Chromebook.",
I've been looking for something with these features for a long time.  I've been using the free version for 2 weeks and been happy with it so far.,
"I haven't used the premium features yet but the ability to attach notes, files etc looks extremely useful",
My only complaint is that some to-do items get overlooked due to diff views looking too similar (e.g. inbox vs today). Otherwise I like it so far.,
A good way to manage your tasks and a neat interface. Would have liked the possibility of adding notes to the tasks without having to be a premium user.,
"Very easy to use. Well organized and linked to most popular browsers, mobile operating systems, and even email providers. Thanks for this great app.",
I wish u could send my friends notifications to remind them instead of having to add their own means of contact. Makes it hard to do complicated group projects.,
I've tried a lot of todo apps. This one is the best. Especially once I started importing the data into the Sunrise app.,
"Love this app. Cross functional across all devices, great ui and better than any others out there. Highly suggest downloading it.",
Wasn't of much use to me. Fix those bugs and I'll keep it,
"I use Todoist to basically run my whole life. I use the web application mainly, and the mobile app to add new tasks when I'm out and about, or to look at a list of errands. It works well with the Getting Things Done system, which is how I use it. Todoist is a great enhancement to my life.",
Add a function so I can cross-reference with Evernote directly from the app and it will be perfect.,
Great application but recurrent reminders are missing. The pro version have fair price.,
"Simple and super easy to work with.  It doesn't have too much complicated tools that only confuse things, but a right-to-the-point layout that makes a breeze going through my to-do list.  Love it!",
"I really like this app. It is working nice. If there is a way of reminding missed calls ,texts, emails it will be more usefull.",
"I use it for lists.. Grocery shopping, tracking my tips/wages, goals, and so much more. I'm not sure if that's an intended use of it but that works perfect",
"Simple to use and helping me to stay on track with uni work. Also the widget is great and can do everything I need to do there, so never need to launch the app to see what I need to do :)",
"Wish there was an ""All"" option so that I can see all my tasks at the same time regardless of the date.",
"Todoist is like having a back-up for my brain. I love being able to input tasks immediately as they come up. And when my plans go awry (as they often do), I love having a place where I can get back to and say""okay, now where was I?"" It's very user-friendly!",
Dear Team App is wonderfull but its take to much ram and this impact my phone battery life.,
"I've tried several apps for managing my personal tasks, and this had all the features and ease of use I've been looking for.",
Great app to help me stay organized. The sharing feature makes for easy communication on projects and to-dos.,
I find this app really do a great job. I especially like the many options to set due date.,
Was looking for something that worked across both Windows and android to sync task list.  Was using tasks free on android before purchasing new windows tablet.  Not quite as easy as tasks free but very clise.,
"I love ToDoist, and use it all day every day. It strikes a perfect balance between features and simplicity.",
"It's being such a great tool for my life, I recently and gladly became a premium member and recommend it to everyone ;)",
This is a great app for a to do list. There are no ads and it's got a premium feel. Even for the free version. The only problem is that the paid version is expensive. I think it's 20/year for some extra features like task reminders.,
"But does not have a pop up notification. Doesn't look optimized for Android, and sometimes it failed to remind me. The month of trial premium I was not impressed.",
"Too many features to even get too.  I've been looking for a task app than enables me to be more productive, not create more work managing tasks.  Worth every penny for premium.",
"Great looking, modern design. Syncs seamlessly across all platforms and the widget that comes with it is fantastic as well. Lovely all in all",
"This application makes time management painless. Could use a few enhancements, but this is my preferred task application.",
"Enables the organization of tasks in a human way.  Group tasks under projects, add labels, set due by times and dates, view tasks in multiple formats to better ensure awareness and completion. For those who don't need a full project manager but do need to impose discipline this is a good option. Pro version allows for full collaboration and task sharing.",
"I've used lots of different list apps and this one is by far my favorite. Great organization, easy to use. Definitely recommend.",
I'd  sampled quite a few to do lists before settling on this one.  Elegantly simple. It's project based approach to tasks is suited to the way I work.,
I think these guys really understand the philosophy of to do lists and getting things done.,
"Just helps me feel more accomplished, by far, and helps me do the tasks that sometimes I would ignore if on paper. Awesome app! :)",
Can't see task completed only if i upgrade :( will use Google keep instead,
"I also used to use Any.do in the past and like the way this app looks and moves better.  I agree with another reviewer that asks for a dark background instead of the white, but I like what I see so far!",
I do apologise for my previous haste review. Just hadn't managed to find what I was looking for (in the long list of apps I checked that day). But I'm going to try this one again later!,
"I have a list of features in my head for my ideal 'to do' list app, and this ticks most of them.",
"This app makes it easy to organise my tasks, and I love how it sends me reminders per email.",
"Simple, elegant, integrates with Sunrise, IFTT. Nice widget. If you stop charging for notifications will give 5 stars.",
I've used so many different to-do list apps and they've all been wonky in one way or another. This one is the cleanest in both design and functionality. Nice job!,
"It is really intuitive engine which gives me flexibility how I want to manage my tasks. I am using Pro version but the free one is also good if you do not require all the custom reminders, etc.",
Love the simplicity. Easy to setup and collaborate. However please add a function to assign a task to more than one person. Thanks,
"ToDoist is for me by far the most complete task app available, working cross platform.   The price of the Pro version is worth it for the reminder setting alone",
"Great tool,  simple which I guess has advantages and disadvantages. Overall the simplicity wins as it natural to keep using.",
"Amazing app helps me keep track of what I need to do, what I've already done, and prioritise tasks. Love the points feature to spur you on further",
"Works perfectly well for how I need it. Being able to add projects and subtasks is a brilliant feature. Thanks a lot, devs.",
"Love everything, especially sync with sunrise calendar. Wish I could get desktop notifications tho",
Haven't used it too much yet but it seems to work well. One thing I would like to see is the ability for completing sub-tasks to complete the parent task.,
Good app. User friendly. Would like to be able to sort by date easier. Like that I can categorize ie projects.,
My new favorite to do app. With project support and multi platform support..so good and keeps me on track,
Switched because of the IFTTT support.  And how you can do sub taska/projects really easily,
"Clean, simple and logically organized. I use it for work projects and personal tasks. Syncs beautifully across devices and to Gmail.",
"No complaints. Used them all, by far Todoist is the best task-oriented app available. Love the Pro features as well.",
"When the android app also gets the new feature (already on the windows app) to assign batches of tasks to a different project, then it will really be great.",
The only feature this doesn't have when free is notifications for each event. And unfortunately you have to pay a rather high yearly fee for the premium package that allows you to have notifications. But the good news is the app is so good I barely have to Sorry about this since It's so good at being accessible and quick.,
"Best solution for quickly making a to do list on the go and easy to edit, reschedule, delete or mark as complete instantly.",
I kept getting a message asking me to rate todoist which I did on an older version early in my use. They asked for it I lowered my rating one star because they don't have project filter for mobile which had become necessary as I have increased my use of app.,
"I am a list maker and note taker by nature. I use the free version and it is the best. The only way I can think of to make it better is to add a checklist section for grocery shopping, etc. You can use the projects section as a checklist to get around this, but it would be nice to have a checklist format. I appreciate the simplicity and efficiency of the design and the ability to categorize.",
"I've tried a LOT of to do apps, and I keep going back to todoist. Would give 5 stars if only the reminders feature was free.",
My latest fave productivity app. Also of note integrates with Cloud Magic email.,
My productivity has increased ten fold since I started using Todoist. Highly recommend.,
Good platform coverage but a few idiosyncrasies - entries not date sorted.,
"I am a heavy GTD and To Do Apps user, and having tried so many of them, I have to say Todoist comes on top of the list.",
I love apps that can be used on iOS and Android devices and on a PC or Mac. This app is a prime example. it's a great way of managing all kinds of lists.,
Easy to use and organize. Syncs effortlessly everywhere. Loss of features and notes and project organization options.  Just a wonderful app for tasking.,
Has made me much more organised. I have lists for everything now. Really easy to use.,
Use it to get organised at work. Would love it if the completed task was more accessible and better sorted. Thanks guys,
"I don't use the social function of sending tasks to friends/family, but I think that would work well too.",
I was using Google Keep for my daily tasks but switched to Todoist and have found it much easier to work with for my purposes.,
I have been on a quest since Franklin Covey had a product called ascend for the perfect productivity tool. Looked and tried hundreds of to-do apps. Stop looking as this is the best of them all.,
"I've tried all of the todo lists out there and for now this one works the best for me: a nice combo of attractive design and features, and I have no problems with sync. This app allows me to manage the many, many projects I have going on at once.",
"Seriously recommended to all user. Senang nak handle, godek puas baru you all tahu apps ni best giler ahh ding dong.",
Great well designed ToDo app however premier features are needed to make full use of it. It has the potential to become whatsapp of ToDo world if they set the pricing right. $28.99/year will limit that. Like Whatsapp $1/year will make everyone switch to premium version with even more revenue than the current model.,
"I have an task app like the app but wouldn't waste time on set up all tasks manually.   No import options, useless app it is.  A reason I download it is its ability to sync all platforms.",
"I got the premium app to access Notes function however the free version is basically just as good. Love it, great app!",
This app changed the way I work. I can now plan and know when and what I have to do at all times. Highly recommended.,
I like weird stuff. Meaning not the same stuff Ever body else writes Note  on..m,
"Definitely the best productivity app in the market. Great community, brilliant cross device support, continuously improved. Love it!",
"I love Todoist and the App goes right in hand with it. I like being able to add tasks from my phone during a meeting, and then instantly see them on my screen when I return to my desk.",
I love this app and I use it daily but if only I could make font size bit smaller I would have given it 5 stars.  Overall thumbs up.,
"This app keeps me accountable and encourages me to get things accomplished ! Very helpful . keeps me organized. Great for the forgetful , overwhelmed and busy !",
So good I upgraded to premium. :) helps me sort out my organizational + personal + professional life.,
I use it as my primary tasks manager. It's just so simple to add tasks and reminders. The interface is clean and nice. For me is the best one of them all,
It just randomly changes the due dates that I set. Always to a later date.,
I love the simplicity of the interface and it's connectivity across platforms. I've tried many task managers and this is the best. I am hoping to see more bells and whistles in the future (maintaining the simplicity ).,
"i havent found a better todo app, collabrotion is neat and nice features make it easy yet very capable",
I love that I can review my list online and on mobile devices. Very organized but not overwhelming. I use it everyday to keep me on track. Very glad I found this app.,
iOS version looks more like material design and than Android... Disappointing. Step it up,
"Greatest Task Management app ever! I finally have a to do list app that lets me arrange tasks in both lists and priority rating. I will have to subscribe to the premium version to add alerts and  labels for my GTD tracking. But for many, the free version will be good enough.",
"This is task list I'm looking for. With many platform, I can manage my task from android and from my laptop.",
Once I got my head wrapped around how it wants to do things I find it incredibly useful.,
"I used to use Google keep for all my important tasks, but it doesn't save time. I find this quite useful",
"Its a step up from a simple to do list. Reminds you of any tasks to complete for the day and bugs you if it isn't completed. Love it, keep it up :)",
Have just signed up for premium and loving it but design now looking a bit tired. Needs some material design love so 5 stars for the service 4 stars for the app!,
"As I have lots of different responsibilities in my work, I tend to have loads of small todos. This app helps me to keep track of them and sync the between phone, laptop and home PC.",
"I am a premium sub, features are not good enough for $30.",
"I use the free version of ToDoist on my computers, tablet and phone to track personal and work-related tasks. Love it and am considering the paid version. Have used other task managers (including Google's) but ToDoist works best for me.",
"Tried them all at some point: Wunderlist, Any.do, Trello, Evernote, but Todoist is the best, great widget, free version is decent and the premium version adds lots of functionality",
There are many useful ways of looking at tasks via filters and labels. I liked the 30 day trial of premium so much that I bought a subscription. Can't wait for the material UI update.,
I like the app. My only problem is that you cannot set the same goal for more than one day. I tend to try for a lot of same things everyday but I have to you're them in and set the whole thing up for each day.,
One star deducted coz there is no option to delete completed tasks. What I liked most about this is the fast sync across all my devices.  Fastest among the all I have used,
"Love being able to use on all my devices, Android, iPad, PC & Chrome extension. I can see what I need to do and add additional to do's from any device.",
"I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking forward for a easy, light and usable todo app. Well integrated web desktop and mobile app. Great integration with Gmail. Should improve: integration to calendar and the feature to attribute duration at tasks.",
"Best to do list I've used, trying to get everyone in my office to use as well.",
Annual fee is steep. I paid it for year 1. Not sure I will do it for you year 2.,
"I love the fact that this is a cross platform program with a simple interface! Because the price is so affordable, my whole team now uses it.",
Tried asana for a while. That app is crap. Todoist is perfect and it has offline mode.,
"I think material should be your Android team's highest priority at this point, L has been around for 8 months!",
"Great app! I have nothing to compare it to because I have never used a productivity app before but this one is very intuitive and easy to navigate. The widget is great and the ""tap to add task"" feature is great for reminding you that you have something todoist to add to the list.",
"Excellent enhancement to my current GTD techniques (email, calendar) don't know how I've done it without it!",
"Unlike other to do apps like wunderlist....this is a very good app that has a clean user interface, easy to use and no privacy concerns.",
"Simple enough, but thorough.  Mussing a few features I would love to see but overall excellent.",
"I tried any.do, wunderlist and other apps but stayed with this one, the only thing I would add is a month calendar view",
The best task management app I have ever used. Brilliant UI and utility.,
I used this app during my house move and worked a treat reminding me and tracking items I listed. Good work!,
"I tried almost every GTD tools out there.. In terms of same functionality and consistency across devices and platforms, Todoist is still the winner. You gotta use it to get the experience.",
"I use the computer (Web-based) version of this application more often than the Android application. However, together, they are a necessary component of my time management strategy. Used to be a little buggy, but they worked hard to improve that. Great customer support in the premium version.",
"Simple and elegant. Love the fact I can create a task from an email, set an action date and get a reminder with a link to the email",
"This app along with it's desktop, browser and other mobile counterparts keeps me on top of the countless tasks I am assigned at work.  It has become invaluable after only a week or so of use.",
New version much better on Android.  Helps organize and  prioritize things that need to get done.,
"I set up all of my tasks, and the app e-mails me and alerts me to keep me on track. Wonderful. Thank you!",
When we talking about how we can organize our time without secretary we say this app it's perfectly the one how can do it,
It worked on every device I had. Synchronized with Google calendar. The thing I needed.,
"Easy to use, at the same time as it is a very powerful tool. The karma feature definitely helped me become more productive from the very beginning.",
Confusing at first but you get the hang of it. It is fulfilling when you can cross things off your list.,
"Before I use this app, i used any.do, overall that app is good but i stil find something loosing, then i decided to download this app and in fact i find it almost perfect, i dont have anything to critique.",
"I have used this app for a little over a year now, and its helped me to be more organized.  I look forward to checking items off my list and the program is  very user friendly.  I love it!!",
Like the Gmail add on helps me keep track of mails and tasks. It's like all in one tracker.,
"I've had it for a couple of days, and I am happy with the app. I like that you can classify projects by color, and the design is very clean, so it is easy to see all your tasks.",
"It does the job and I like the wear integration, but some functions seem unnecessarily cumbersome, such as recurring tasks. Revised rating and uninstalled. This is a waste. Missed too many notifications and just too cumbersome to use.  Switched to any.do",
Really helpful especially to remember chores and errands that one generally tends to forget due to our hectic lives.,
Helps me with lots of tasks.. though I tend to procrastinate lol..,
"I use this app all the time to organize myself. I wish it had more features, but I have the free version, and the devs have to make a living somehow.",
"I use Todoist at work and at home and it's so easy to use and keeps me on track with my work, household and finances. I'd recommend it to anyone.",
It has all your life scheduling needs simply and beautifuly displayed. Whether you need a todo list or a life planner this is what you need,
Been looking for something like this for a long time.   Everything works great.   It's reliable and looks like it'll be around for a long time which is important.   Pro version is worth every penny.   Get it!,
I liked for years to find the perfect todo manager and in todoist I've found just that. I use it every day and it had massively improved my productivity. Simple but effective,
Todoist is simple clear and concise. Adding and removing task  is straight forward. Cloud infrastructure allows you to view and edit your tasks across a wide range of smart devices. Trustworthy work secretary!,
I've been using todo is for about 1 month so far it helps me a lot to organize myself. Great app!,
"This app is beautifully designed. Simple, yet super robust. Can do pretty much everything the desktop version does, but still an amazingly clean interface.",
"Very simple to use it, no complication, I organized tens of tasks in all my week in few minutes.",
The app is great. I wish that there were a one-time purchase version with a few more features though.,
"I use Wunderlist as well, which has more features (for free), but Todoist is slicker ui and better integration with all platforms.",
"Todoist is great and I use it as a browser extension on both Firefox and Chrome. When it comes to the app, I would like to see a better interface for setting times for tasks and notifications. Customization of the widget apperance would be great as well, but I really appreciate the functionality of the widget at this point.",
"Free version really lacks one crucial feature, notifications... You guys should put advertisement to support the application and allow free users to have that functionality",
"It makes it easy to schedule tasks by the week and day, and the app seems a bit more polished than some of the other to-do apps I've tried in the past.",
Best time management and to do app I've used.  The only negative is that it slow down outlook a bit.,
i'm a free user and this is working fine for me. hope to keep being pleased with this product.,
"Compared to the other todolist i use before this app is way faster , it opens like an instant clicked.. its also easier to organize tasks.. although something like view all sub projects task from project would be desirable but its good enuf for now..",
"It is somewhat useful.  I wish the location based reminder worked better and reminded you before you get there,  not when you're sitting in the parking lot. I wish I could have tried it before buying,  I wouldn't have purchased it.",
"Most of the function is very good and fast to add task, however, it will be even better if have repeat task opinion(repeat weekly,monthly,twice a week...), and i found i cannot set the alarm time but only date",
"Good app all around, but the price is ridiculously high.",
I use this app to remind me of key tasks I need to get done in the short term. no complaints so far.,
"Finally, a to-do manager that fits my needs. I'll definitely upgrade to the premium plan soon. I use it on Android, Chrome and Sunrise. (Small suggestion: in the Chrome app, I like adding tasks using only the keyboard, but the ""Priority"" field is not selectable by tab)",
I have used Any. Do off and On but found Todoist provided me with more robust and precise sytem. I still prefer Any. Do's more elegant and modern looking user interface however. Todoist seems to have more support for gmail which I like.,
"For 7.0.3 version. Lean, but functional.  Love it even more than desktop version of todoist. Great widget for quickly adding tasks from the main screen.",
"I keep thinking there's got to be a better todo app out there. Maybe there is, but this is the best one that I've found. Easy to use. Unfussy UI. I'd like it to tie together with Google Calendar / To do better, but does that well.",
Everything is out of my head and on very manageable easy to use task lists. My head feels free from the busyness!,
"Love it! I run logistics for a chemistry and a microbiology lab and this app saves my @$$. I use it for work and for home, and it's super useful and user friendly, very intuitive. I've had no problems with the app and I love that it is usable from both my home and work computer, plus my phone. Keep it up!",
"I've installed Todoist in my desktop, browser, iPad, Android smartphone, Outlook which I think is a cool feature that others don't have. Makes me more productive and efficient in managing daily tasks with my multiple projects.",
"Have used it for two months so far. I have only invested minimal time but have found it to be easy to update, flexible in use, with good notifications.  Most promising, I am guessing I have uncovered only about 1/3 of its potential.",
There are a lot of checklist apps out there but todoist really does offer one of the most functions so you can be have as many creative opportunities for anything you do! The fact that you can connect to IFTTT always help in various ways.,
Great app :) would love to see some integration with google calendar (with the premium version)  and it would be great to have a drop box function that can be linked to a group of people. Delegating tasks to other people also,
"I've only been using it for about a week, but it is handy so far, mainly because I can get to the same list from different types of devices.",
I've been for years looking for to do app that's simple and managing it does not become a burden on me... I was lost and now I am found  love you Todoist...,
Very easy and intuitive. Also gmail plugin works great and makes task management simple and fast.,
Perfect for organizing my life with both one time tasks and recurring tasks.,
"Better if it could has a view to  show a list of completed tasks for the week/month, which could be used for quick mgt review/update (e.g. completion date, due date, task name, details).",
"Nice application,  but uninstalled... I prefer Anydo,  it's much better and it even reminds you the exact hour in which you have to complete the task.",
"Just started playing around with this app. Nicely done. One feature that would be really useful is to add ""how long does it take?"" Field so people can estimate and align their tasks accordingly. Priority marker helps, but a time marker makes it more productive",
"The only to do app I have used for a long period of time. Others have tempted me,  I still come back to Todoist. Been using it for over 18  months now.",
Simple and easy to use. Helps keep.me organized on chaotic days.,
I had this app suggested on a recent management course. It is very easy to use and can easily be used for work and at home. Highly recommended.,
This took almost no time to learn and had become a resource for my entire family.,
Worried about leaving RTM but not missing anything.  Easy to use but  powerful.,
"This app makes it so easy to log activities and so satisfying to complete them. It's clean, functional, does only what it says on the tin, and does it well.",
Only thing missing is end dates on recurring tasks. Otherwise very easy and complete for me.,
Works well with calendars esp Google. I did get one too many recipes and it bounced back to todoist so I got double the reminder! Took the extra off and its great,
Needed a simple task manager that I could share with my wife and both could update.  This one did the job better than anyDo,
"It's a great way to organize! If you have trouble remembering to do something, this helps...your phone is always with you!",
"I love that I can break tasks down into subtasks, and assign priority. Having multiple customizable lists is also a plus!",
To option to add friend.,
This is the best to do app I've ever tried. Getting the premium upgrade is definitely worth it.,
I like to organize and this app even without premium does a lot more than other apps on the market.  I really appreciate it guys!,
"Have used their iOS app and using it now on an Android tab, it simply rocks and is much better than their iOS one.",
I love that I can organize and prioritize my tasks. And it constantly reminds me of tasks that I have not gotten done yet. Love it!,
Very easy to use app that makes life a breeze for those of us who need to cross things off a list for a sense of accomplishment!,
"Great app, the recurring tasks is the best feature, I'd give this app a 5 stars but the there's that bug that annoys me which 'sometimes' makes my tasks unordered when I try to change their order.",
"Elegant, well done, but could use more customization settings such as the notification sound or list sorting. I like the inbox list feature in principal, but it needs to be more integrated and allow users to customize the inbox.",
Great app that helps keep me on task better than I ever was able to before. I'm an IT manage and have told my entire team to start using this. I have three who are interns and they are using it also to help them stay on top of their classes. Great job!!!,
Absolutely love this app and I will go premium version very soon. I recommend it to anyone who has been having trouble getting things done. Thank you for the great app!,
Too simple to use.  I had never forgot my important  stuffs after started  using it.,
Only let down was that it doesn't actually work in Outlook for Mac. Oh  well.,
Does what i need it to. Only slight annoyance is that it keeps asking to confirm my time zone.,
"Clean and easy to use, I'm glad the creators have avoided feature bloat unlike similar apps",
This will cost you money to use properly.  Skip this app.,
Great app - able to keep track my tasks anywhere and in any platform; flexible labels (premium only) allows to apply GTD principles,
"Very useful efficient tool for project management, but also daily tasks that need that extra follow up",
I'm not a big App user but i use todoist every day.,
"I can do w/o the daily emails, but not nothing major to report. Its great!!",
"It does everything an active to do list does, but I recommend wunderlist for any type of static list, hands down",
"Great way to stay on top of things. Great app, must have as a biz owner!",
It's so simple and so powerful that it tops every other productivity app I've tried before.,
Synchronizes with ease and keeps you up to date with your daily tasks. It increases your productivity and keepsbyou on your toes.,
But only 4 stars because the widget won't update correctly all the time.,
All other apps makes it difficult to keep one list. But Todist has it all! Any device or browser I use now has my work with me! Awesome app!,
Its rly help me to remmeber all my things in ma life,
"This app makes it so easy to stay on track with bills, errands, work and everything else.",

"It works, but I am think there should be a better way to manage the alerts.",
"Excellent planner: it is simple, fast and very flexible. Also, the karma points system is very engaging and help to keep track of my daily (little) accomplishments",
Worked great does everything I need.keep up the good work. Robin north carolina,
This app truly changed my level of productivity and thus my life. Thank you ToDoIst.,
"Recurring sub tasks and keyboard shortcuts can be improved, but great app overall.",
"By far the best ""todo"" or productivity app out there",
Todoist is a pleasure to use. Love how it's accessible from all devices and make environments.,

I particularly like recurring tasks. Works well with my calendar apps.,
Good app design and simple to use. Best part is syncing across many platforms. Top marks,
The first to do list that has actually been useful for me. I love the different ways to sort and view the lists. Great for everything from project planning to birthdays!,
I wish the information displayed was denser. The app is much better than the desktop version.,
I have just been using the paid version for about a month and it is awesome. Does everything I need or to do.,
"Just what the doctor ordered, getting more done in a day thanks to this app, very easy to track your productivity",

There are some lollipop design guidelines that would be make this app even better looking than already is.,

Best way I've found to make sure I stay on track every day.,
"I use it everyday to help organize,  plan, and keep track of everything that I need to do.",
I just started a couple days ago and already love this tool!  I'm so glad I found something that syncs no matter what computer or device or software I'm using.,
This app has helped me tremendously. It allows me to use my time more efficiently and prioritize my goals!,
And I looked at a lot of them. Premiere version definitely worth buying.,
This app is awesome. I knew it could be. I watched a few videos on YouTube and started using it today. I love it,
"After a long search for a good task management app..I found this one! Paid for premium, well worth it.",
The free version works great for me. Better than Outlook in my opinion. Great integration with gmail.,
Love this app! The growth chart thing really motivates me to get things done!,
I've tried all the major to do apps and this is by far the best.  It has all the key features in the free app.  Been a premium member for over a year now - well worth the price.  I run my day on todoist!  Highly recommended!,
Can easily add and update from browser plugin or fat client or phone.  I love the way you can add a gmail email as a task.  Helps me organize and not forget my responses!,
I can achieve so much more witg this app. And i love the date recognition feature!,
"Being an avid list maker , todoist is one of the best programs I've used for its simplicity and accesibility. Id give it five stars if it weren't that for some lists id like to just write it out and hit enter. Great program! Try it out!",
This application is amazing as it also works from desktop and get sync with Android phone as well having amazing features that helps you a lot to complete your task by time.,
Thank you for keeping me organized.  But reminder shouldn't have been a paid feature.,
Helps me stay organized. I wish I could add notes without having to upgrade,
"Has a lot of features I really like. For a to-do list manager, $30/year is a lot.",
I've only recently downloaded it but it seems good so far.,
The important problem is it needs reminders at least cell phone notification services,
Very helpful app and has been more functional in my daily routine than I expected.,
If it was cheaper I might consider paying for it.,
Need to add a feature which after it remind your  todays work ask if u dont want to do it  then after 2 hrs or 4 hrs it should remind u.                              Alarm should be loud and flash reminder on screen after 2 to 4 hrs,
Plan to upgrade to paid version soon.,
"Using Todoist with Evernote, Cloud Magic, and some Google spreadsheets, mostly through IFTTT... complete game changer! The MOD videos on YouTube about all the above are crazy awesome! The more I discover of these fine apps, the more zen I seem to find. It's so sweet how they can all work together and I'm simply amazed! Thank you Todoist, I needed this!",
"I'm yet to fully use it but from about a month of experience, it does deliver on its promise.",

Try it and you won't stop using it.,
"Simple, intuitive, helps me get things done.",
"It would be very helpful if Todoist has calendar integration so that i can visualize the upcoming tasks while checking for appointments/events planned at the same time. Sometimes the filters (even the default inbox, today, next 7 days) arent as effective as looking at a calendar full of appointments AND tasks that needs to be completed that day so that i can prioritze more effectively. When that day comes where calendar integration is available, i will rate this app at 5 stars.",
Don't think twice. Go for it. I bet this will make ur life easier.,
Easy to use graphical user interface makes it so attractive to use this application.,
"You have to sign up for the premium service to get the reminders feature. That's a free, basic feature on just about any other task manager app. Thanks, but no thanks.",

Keeps everything on track..  Just enter the info and it is in a very convenient list.,
"Great app, easy to use, rewards you for getting things done!",
"This app has allowed me to better plan for long term projects and assignments. One suggestion I have is to add a ""next 30 days"" tab to the section where the ""inbox,"" ""today,"" and ""next 7 days"" tabs are located. All in all, it's still an excellent app!",
Excelent for people that want to be productive. Excelent for use with GTD Methodology,

Keeps my tasks well organized. Makes life easier for me. Kudos to the developers.,
I love the app. Wish it was easier to get rid of completed tasks but otherwise it is a great app.,
It doesn't sync to google calendar.,
Does exactly what I need it to do and integrates with all the calendars and mail apps you need. Awesome job!,
I feel like I am more effective and efficient thanks to this app.,
Switched to using this so for my GTD after OmniFocus on iOS and it's great.,
Perfect reminding solutions and goal focusing rewards. It really is the best reminder tool.,
Certain functionality such as creating views is missing and/or non intuitive,

It has what I need to organize my tasks.,

"Clean and simple, but really lets me keep track of my tasks anywhere.",
The best to do app I have used.Love the simple interface. Great job devs,
Todoist has given me the peace of mind that nothing will fall through the cracks,

"Unfortunately there isn't full support for filters (eg the ability to include tasks from two projects) in this app, nor does the app contain basic sorting functionality.",

Perfect for keeping track of daily tasks and larger projects.  Easy to use and functional.,

Works just the way I want it to. Good job!,
Amazing app! Can't ask for better,
I've tried dozens of other task managers and this is by far the best!,
Keep up the good work!,
"Has gradually become my primary tool for organising both my work and home 'to do' lists. Two of its most valuable features are: (a) its ability to work and synchronise across platforms, making it easy to work on mobile, tablet and laptop without constantly worrying about having access to your most current list; and (b) being able to work on or off-line, meaning you're not constantly postponing things until you can find a connection (by which time you've usually forgotten them!).",
"Very powerful desktop web interface, sync across all devices. Very satisfied.",
Almost $30 a year for the full featured version... Crazy. I would outright buy for $10 at most.,
"Easy to use, reminders in emails and easy to edit!!",
Get it -  you will not be disappointed.,
Excellent app.. but didnt like reminder mails,
This app is helping you need to organize my life.,
"Unfortunately,  adding a quick note  is a premium feature.  Go figure.",
"great app, but free version is not enough and premium should be charged only once",
Why is specification of sort order crippled in the app? You have to go to the web page every time you add a task to re-sort the tasks.,
Works just like description says. Great product. Would recommend.,
"I am premium user and very enjoy using this app to get organizing my life. But i wish dev team will add more features. ex: it hard to take fast note because if i choose label, the ""ok"" button will be hiden by the keyboard, can't change label multi task together. In window platform, app don't have the button to set time ( you have to type 6am, not just click in android), the remimder just apppear in noti panel, i wish it could do sthing more speacial like floating in front of other app to get my attention in",

Great app with Outlook integration and reminders. Never miss a todo again!,
"Hi,  is it possible to trial a month of premium to evaluate before investing and moving away from 2do? Thanks",
Tried lots of to do systems in the past 20 years... getting quite useful now.,
Easy to use for the daily stuff. I like the motivational tone.,
"I've tried a few of these, and none of them have lived up to the hype! This one however comes the closest [apart from the £18 annual subscription fee]. With multi level projects, labels, and an intuitive interface, this app gives you a that and it works across multiple platforms. There's a bit of work I'd do on it, but it's pretty much the best one yet. You'll be hearing from me with some ideas [which are probably already in the pipeline] ;-)",
I love this apps widget! Probably the best list app out there!💚,

The combination of design and functionality has really blown me away and keeps me using it everyday for work and personal tasks too,
This app is great for keeping my work and personal life organized!,
"I use this app daily to track tasks, projects, and reminders",

I wish it has the support to view the tasks in the watch. Currently I can only add tasks in Android wear,
Shows you what you need and when easy to program not overly technical but very helpful in real life,
I just love softwares where I can feel the passion of its creators!!,
$30 a year? Ridiculous... It's a To Do List app... No way does it need a subscription or a price tag of $30,
"Clean, linear app is easy to use. Lifesaver for listmakers.",
"Can be a simple checklist, or can easily be setup for GTD.",
Reminds me of every assignment due for grad school!!!,
To sum up the whole opinion I can say it's very good,
I particularly like the Outlook integration. Helping with organization a lot.,
I really appreciate how this app works on different platforms. Keep up the good work!,
Love the synchronisation across all my devices. Widget is awesome and functional.,
One of my main tools along with Trello and Evernote. Superb.,
"Google calendar, task and keep sync would be great !",
Without forgetting any task finish it. Reminder and notification please me lot,
Great straightforward app. User friendly and a great app to organize a busy life to get more done.,

That's the best app (platform) to manage task lists. But don't have timers to track task's length.,
Helps me stay organized and on task,
A great way to schedule tasks and get inspired to keep on track,
So we can test it,
I especially love the integration into Outlook,
Like the synchronisation across devices and the price is excellent,
The widget could be a bit smaller,
It is an intelligent app that helps me organize my life,
Great for GTD workflow. Switched from ZenDone. The app is a pleasure to use.,
"Very cool, it will be perfect if you can have global board Iike trello",
Works better than check lists I would say,
"Really helpful, I am enjoying it!",

This application helps me so much,
Wonderful app...love it simply,
...wish it was not so expensive for the subscription.,
Only few features should require internet and user's data should be stored for offline use.,
"Can set up a list for every morning...  No recuring alarm. How stupid is that?....******After their reply.******  You must be joking, I looked, where would a person put that in?  WHY and HOW would a person ever think it ....""writing that somewhere""?   That is what options and radio buttons our check boxes are for.  Documentation is NEVER EASY to find on apps, yours and everyone else's as well.",
"No nonsense, just works.",
Nice to use . must for everyone.,
So far I'm impressed,

"I have been using Todoist since 2013. My life have never been so organized. From the moment I discovered how to set recurring tasks and schedule events, everything went smoother. I am no longer using post its, and with ICal configuration I have replaced Google Calendar. Still needs a little bit of help on the sync-up between platforms, but is great to use.",
This product is useful but on android you have to use sunrise for seeing the tasks sync on calendar and cloudmagic for enabling the association or conversion of an email to a task. On the desktop you must work with gmail and sunrise. These 2 combinations are very well suited for todoist. Check mark's confusing:decide what it means and stick to it .,
"There are some minor gripes like recurring tasks always being put to the next occurrence, e.g. completing a daily tasks at 00:01 will make it skip the rest of the day you marked it complete, not the day you might have done the task for. But in general it works pretty well, and they even have a public API as well as a fairly obvious financing concept, hinting at long term availability.",
"I would have given this 5 stars if I could view my completed tasks, and the website and application functioned more similarly. On the app, you can select multiple tasks at once, but the website functions differently. It's counter intuitive after using the app 99% of the time, and I find myself getting frustrated with the website and not able to undo mistakes as I can on the app.",
A bit of a learning curve to setup projects and such. But after a couple of months I'm finding this app very efficient and useful. One critique is the check marks. There the Same check mark icon for complete task in one screen and done editing in another screen. A little confusing.,
"I've used a few to-do & general list apps and Todoist is the one I've settled on. Once you're used to the nesting structure and have things set up the way you want (you can adjust the ""home"" view etc) it's excellent. Syncing is immediate and as you would expect (I've found other apps lacking in this regard) and being able to share lists without subscribing to other features you might not need is also a real bonus. Try it!",
"I moved to Todoist from Remember the Milk, but was missing location-based reminders...until now! Better integration with Google Now would be the next killer feature. Even without that, this app is nearly perfect.",
I can't even get the reminders out of the drop down menu if I wanted too...I've been better about getting things taken care of since downloading this program.,
Very easy to maintain todo list. It made me lazy to remember things.,
So much you can do with it. One thing in particular that I love is that you can customize repeat tasks. You'll never go back to other list like it.,
"You are limited to a title for your task, no description allowed - unless you fork over nearly $30 a year. Seriously? I can't even describe what my task is without paying? I understand charging for something reasonable, like group access to projects, or cloud storage. But this ridiculous limitation makes the ap useless for pretty much anyone outside of a corporate environment. NTY!",
Just keeps getting better. Flawless app with a nice simple layout and does exact what it is supposed to do. Karma is a nice incentive to complete tasks. I love this app :),
"I've tried a good number of cloud to do apps and this one ended up on the top of my list. If you like optimizing and figuring out a way to make a tool work for you, give this one a go.",
I've used the premium services for a year now and I will be re-upping for another. Prior to this service I tried at least a dozen others. Each offers something unique and I'd suggest that each person tries to find their niche. This works well for me.,
"Since I installed this app, I used it pretty much everyday to track work and personal tasks. Very good tool to make you more efficient. Great interface and sync across all devices. Recommend to anyone.",
I've tried them all and for simple to do list application this is great. Magnificent chrome extension and Web app as well. Highly recommend.... Continues to improve.. Job well done,
"I live in Brazil, premium costs around 75 Brazilian Reais a year, that's too much! I love the app by the way, it works wonders so it deserves it's five stars!",
"Quite good. I'd appreciate a quick-add feature, so I can add tasks with one click",
Simple and functional. That's all one needs to get organized.,
Widget is as powerful as app and web!,
Assssom + simple worth using,
"Not overly complex, but with all the features you need",
"Cool app, but there should really be a 2x2 widget.",
Clean and flawless UI. Love the widget also,
Good app for tracking pending work,
Seems like it should easily integrate with other calendar programs like Google or Yahoo,
Looking for app that is not so nosy,
"Best to do app for Android.  Talks to Evernote,Sunrise Calendar. Great!",
Easy to use and helps me remember stuff all the time,
Does what it says on the tin.,
"Very helpful, I recommend it.",
And the app works perfectly!,
That makes this app useless for me. Seriously missing Astrid!,
"Simple, clean and to the point.",
excellent todo manager. Easy to use. Minimal ui.,
Wunderlist has reminders in free version. Why not Todoist then?,
Awesome app for almost everything,
Easy and not annoying with reminders,
Realice varias pruebas cambiando una tarea y jamas recibi ninguna alerta en mi celular.  Eliminada la aplicación.,
Can you make the notification pops up?,
Great app love it,
Great practical features,
,
"Started using the website to get a bit more organised and very impressed with it. The free version is more than enough for me and makes keeping track of the things I need doing much easier. The mobile app is very well made too and easy to use on the move, particularly for things like shopping lists!",
"Love this app. It was easy to get my team on board. I took literally a day to have everyone up and running. It helps that I can use tool like zapier with todist, and that the mobile app os so easy to use. My only complaint is that I cant get a time stamp for when a task is created, began, and completed. That would make the decision to buy that much easy. It the only thing missing fpr what we need.",
"Have been testing as a tool to assign, update and remind management members on projects and tasks involving team members from other sites... It's doing what we need. Only thing I would like to see would be an actual calendar view widget for PC and mobile devices...",
"Very few problems with this tool so far.  Would easily give it 5 stars if it had the ability to manage tasks with bulk actions.  It can become very cumbersome when you are managing multiple projects with similar requirements/tasks but can only manage said tasks one at a time/manually. However, overall it is the best value at $30/yr for a project management tool.",
Have really benefited from having this because it syncs across my phone and laptop so I can edit and amend lists or tasks on the go and at work. Could be improved if it included reminder settings automatically and allowed you to add tasks one after another without having to keep clicking on the add task button (comparing with tasks on Google calendar).,
"Would give it a 4.5 rating.  I am a sucker for new, promising to do list/project manager apps.  I have tried a ton of them.  I have concluded that we all have our unique ways of working, and it is impossible for an app to perfectly suit everyone.  This one comes close for me, with it's great cross-platform syncing.  I use it via iPhone, Android tablet and Outlook.  I sacrifice recurring tasks and notes, the latter because I am not willing to pay $29 annually for that feature.",
"I'm a freshman in college ad honestly, I can't keep track of half of the things I have to do. With this app, I can quickly jot down errands and set up reminders to get back to work. And getting notifications of tasks I haven't completed is great. Also, I can sync my tasks to my calendar! And I can do all of this with the free version!   You do have to get used to the layout and how to input information in, but after that it's a breeze! I definitely recommend this.",
"I'm addicted to task manager apps.  It's the main reason I have a smartphone.  Todoist has a lot going for it: a nice clean interface, simple to use, and a great support site and blog to help keep you motivated.  I do think it's worth the subscription fee.",
I got really annoyed with the focus on collaboration/sharing in so many todo list apps. It's a feature I will never use so I don't want it in my face all the time. Todoist has a refreshing approach with a separate product for teams - sharing is now available but it's out the way if you don't want it.**Edit - increased to 5 stars following addition of IFTTT integration.,
"I have always had lots of thoughts and ideas that come to me faster than I keep track of. I really needed a tool to help me remember them, organize them, prioritize them, remind them and keep track of them. I have used many other apps like this. However, even though I have started using Todoist recently and don't know everything about it yet, I find it to be superior to others, in terms of functionality and features. Thank you!",
"Ok, not as pretty, but repeating tasks can be made in so many ways, a feature only available in the paid app of any.do. Make your own categories, reschedule, etc. Easy to use. Wish list: send tasks to my husband, put the completed check box beside each task instead of at the bottom of the screen.",
"...a year or 2 later, Im still quite pleased!         I used Astrid until they were bought out, I tried Wunderlist for a while but was never really satisfied with either.  Finally I tried Todoist - wow what a superior product.  It's easy to organize and assign tasks, the interface is fairly easy to use.",
"The reason people use apps like these are not just to remember the things they have to do, but also to keep track of their progress, and inherently get a sense of reward when their tasks are finished. Of course, a completed task should be a reward in and of itself, but the ability to see your progress is very motivating. Unfortunately, ToDoist does not allow that - completed tasks disappear from their projects and the Today view, and are only visible with all the other historical completed tasks in a separate section of the app.  Users have been asking for this feature in a thread that's over a year old, and the company does not seem to think it is a priority.   I'm a premium user, and when my subscription ends I'll be moving on. In fact, if I find an app that does this and has the features of ToDoist, I'll leave, regardless of how much of my subscription I have used.",
"I've been going through app after app, and with a suggestion from a nephew,  I tried todoist. I heard of it, but never used it. Now that I have, I quickly ported all my lists into this app and paid the yearly backup fee. I deleted all other apps, and I am organized and very happy with this app. A very good find that brings piece of mind. Thanks.",
"I've tried a fair few todo list managers over the years and this one is the best. The user experience is awesome, everything I wanted to do could be done easily and I found it intuitive. Todoist strikes the right balance between usefulness and intrusiveness.",
"Todoist is seriously one of the most useful mobile/computer apps. I use it at work CONSTANTLY, and the ability to sync your Todoist account makes it super easy to add tasks no matter where you are or what work station you're near. The karma system is also a very nice little addition. It doesn't really do much, but that extra small bit of progress tracking can be really motivating. Fantastic and simple to use app, can't recommend it enough.",
"Have tried all the other major ""todo"" apps and this one supports a large variety of platforms and has great features. Only complaint is that you have to pay for notes and notifications which are key features, but overall this app is terrific.",
"I'm a consultant for a major Consulting firm. I love Todoist. It keeps me on task and allows me to organize my projects effectively. One thing I would add is a ""someday"" ability to catagorize tasks you don't want to give a date to.",
I love this app.  It is simple in design and usabilty but extremely effective.   Everytime I think of something big or small I put it in here and categorize it.   My chances of forgetting things and not getting projects on time has been dramatically reduced thanks to Todoist.  I love that it syncs with my Outlook and how you can collaborate on projects and add comments to the feed or content stream and keep other people in the loop on your progress or lack thereof.  GREAT JOB TODOIST!!!,
I  tried  several  applications  for  listing my tasks  and get organized. This is the best application  that I found. It works on all devices and integrates  nicely  in many email clients  and other  applications. You can use projects and filters and assign  tasks  to names. Also you can get  emails  with  the tasks  per day.,
"This app is the best implementation of a to-do list I've seen yet. Todoist collects all the functionality and features of other apps into a cleaner, more robust package. It's obvious by the design, and the features available free, that Todoist is thoughtfully made to give the customer the best experience possible, while giving the option to pay subscription for expanded functionality. I don't mind paying the subscription; it's commercial-grade functionality for a low monthly cost.",
Simple free tracking in a central place I can get from all my devices.  Convenient and helpful for quick reference of both personal and work tasks.  Not at stage where I need to pay for reminders but can imagine they would be useful.  :),
"It's simple and easy to use. The only problem is that the reminders is not a feature in the free version, which other similar apps have it in their free release. It would have been great if that feature was included rather than asking users to buy the pro version!",
"As a big fan of Allen's Getting Things Done, I've been looking for and finally found a great software tool to accompany GTD.  Thank you Todoist Team for an intuitive, simple and attractive tool.",
"Finding the right tool to track your TODOs turned to be a challenging task. After googling around for quite some time, I think, I found the one that shines the best. I was really impressed how powerful and cross-platform this productivity tool is, not to mention its sharp, elegant and good-looking user interface. Seamless task integration for Gmail as well as IFTTT recipes make Todoist even more attractive and intelligent. When it comes to drawbacks, ~30$/year Premium subscription seems to be quite a high price for such trivial extensions like notes, reminders, labels and filters, which many regular users would like to make use of from the beginning. Lots of similar applications on the market offer these features out-of-the-box just for free. Kind of a bummer… Paid membership must be definitely reviewed to more accurately differentiate between basic (free) and truly premium (paid) features.",
"Makes organizing tasks really easy. Even when you have tons and tons of them. Create projects with sub-projects; each having multiple tasks that can be easily tiered and given different priority  levels. Best thing though,  is the accessibility via any platform: android, windows pc,  browser based on a work computer, apple OS... so you can access your lists from anywhere anytime. Many more features in the premium version for like $30 a year, which is not bad. But free version will do you if you want no problem.",
Waste of time. To add note details you have to upgrade which you have to pay for. Whats the point of putting it free if cant get basic functions.,
I've enjoyed using this app so far and it has helped me become more productive.,
"Im a heavy google user, I use Keep and other note taking app, this is the best all-in one solution I found so far, the widget is great and very eye catching on my phone, make me aware of all coming tasks, I used Evernote before but its too complicated sometimes, I think this app + Keep fulfill all my needs, will spend more time and see! **After months on premium plan I can say it worth every penny!  I have basically use this to replace my google calendar, its a calendar+note pad+task list+planning app❣",
I used to use any.do but they started to push a monthly subscription for basic features.  Todoist has it all,
"I don't write reviews usually. And I don't write this one to endorse Todoist. I write this to promote productivity. Something that this app does way better than other apps that I've used. It does all the right things and solves procrastination, at least for me.",
I switched to this app recently and I'm so happy with it. I was looking for something that has categories and I can add tag and notes to items.,
"Really wanted to like this app as it's the closest thing I've found to Awesome Note which is exclusively on iOS. For me it sadly fails to impress for three main reasons: 1) Can't understand more complicated repeat intervals which I need (a lot!) 2) if you accidently tick something off by mistake, it's gone for good. Infuriating! 3) no option to permanently disable the cloud option. I really do just want things secure and local on my phone!",
"It would be nice to be able to set the time of day when tasks set for that day become over due. Right now, it does this in the morning, even though my real life deadline is at 7:00pm (for example)",
It really is a great app to help keep you on schedule. If you add something without a deadline it ends up in a list that you have to go into to see. Not that bad but a few extra steps for things that might not be on your mind and have to look it up. I'm not sure yet of its good or bad but it also send an email of the days task as well as ones that you haven't finished. If you want to stay on track this is an app for you.,
I like the ability to quickly look through tasks and swipe off when completed. Works great. Daily reminders of upcoming tasks due is cool too.,
I love that it's synced between mobile and laptop. Could have a few minor usability changes...that's why 4 star and not 5 but otherwise AMAZING app if you want to get more organised.,
"It helps make keeping track of my to do lists easier. I can access it from my computer, iPad, and Android phone and all my changes are in real time.",
I use it on an LG G3 on a desktop pc and share a lot of task with my girl's lenovo ideapad tablet.,
"With cloud support and available in 13 platforms, this app easily become my default to-do list for daily activities.",
The free version is perfect for basic task management and is exactly what I was looking for.  I can access it anywhere and my whole family uses it.,
This app has been amaziing at keeping all my projects organized and doe jotting down those great ideas as they hit. Even when I'm miles away from anywhere wallowing my dog,
"It's very very good, but the Pro ver is too expensive compared to other APPs, like Memability or Clipper. Best regards. Manuel Rizo-Patrón R.",
"I love that I can just dump everything I need to do on to Todoist. The user interface is clean & unfussy, and it is so useful to have seamless integration between my Android phone, my iPad & my Mac.",
"I wish I could add descriptions to my tasks, but that's a small gripe. Great app because of its simplicity, it has helped me organize my life better.",
I love this. Integration on all my devices. Great user interface and a sense of organisation. This would be hard to improve on and the upgrade is reasonable and will be my next move. Thanks todoist x,
This app is really well laid-out and has kept me on track better than anything I've used so far.,
"Only used it couple of times, but it achieved its goal perfectly, which is to keep the schedule and todolist. Great app.",
everything look good but the widget is not good enough that why i give you only 4 stars.,
"Great and simple interface, good karma system, awesome schedule and timing choices (everyday, every specific days, on specific date and time, etc), and the reminder is not annoying. Very recommended for group project works using multiple devices!",
"Hassle free task organizer, wonderful app, would recommend try it once, u will fall in love with it",
"I have been a premium user of this service for awhile now and I love it. The app is great and with more and more integration being supported, it keeps getting better.",
You know a productivity app is a good app when you suddenly want to be more productive because of a new app you installed. It works so well and it makes my life so much easier. Keep it up.,
It works perfectly and is very adaptable. The Web app is also very convenient. I've been much more organised since I subscribed for premium.,
I'm a premium user and I find its good for the most part. REALLY needs some basic functions though like copy/pasting your tasks,
"A better to do and talk list than other apps available. Easy to use and a very nice, clean display.",
"The widget isn't the prettiest thing to look at but it's functional. Also, it is confusing trying to figure out how to create tasks that reoccur a specific amount of time after the completion date. Once you figure out how to create those tasks, it works great.",
"Best to do list I've used. I prefer it to wunderlist & anydo. The free version is functional enough for remembering, ordering and prioritising tasks. Good.",
"Hands down my favorite task mgr service provider but can we please 1) have an option to control font size in the widget? (Way too bulky as is), and 2) have the persistent status bar notification a but more useful? Maybe have buttons to cycle through due tasks and a quick add button on the side to that?",
Android experience and widgets are great. It would be better if events modifiers appeared just below event rather than at bottom of screen. Also some allowance for smaller fonts would let more items fit on the screen.,
But the free version doesn't allow notes for tasks & the paid version is very expensive . There are others around cheaper or free & with similar functions. I also don't want to work with this type of layout. Wunderlist interface is more mine,
Personal or professional projects get easier when not forgetting the due tasks. Especially the small details,
Not nearly as intuitive as I would have liked . I found myself struggling to do things that should have been simple for example subprojects.,
"I am calling half cup is empty. Though half is full,  a full one would be 5 star.",
"If you want to make ANY notes on a task to do you are required to pay a whopping $30+ annual fee. Uninstalling the POS app, notifications EVERYDAY to tell me i have NO TASKS. GENIUS.",
"As with any task manager, you need to be disciplined and check it regularly.  But, this one is definitely the easiest one I have found to use.",
"Dont get me wrong keep is good for notes, but Todoist is better at reminding you and labeling certain things. Also the feature that reminds you of daily things and if you missed them.",
Well thought out app that is ease to use and has all the functionality you need.  Suffers from sync problems occasionally.,
"The interface makes it easy to add new tasks on the fly. Also, the Karma system really makes me want to complete more and more tasks each day.",
"Although I thought that it connects to my sunrise calendar, but not. It could be if I write task into the Todoist and that appearances in calendar too...",
"While it does have its flaws, the benefits certainly outweigh them.",
"Time and task management is only as good as the system you employ,  but the right kind of tech helps. Todoist is a game changer for me and the best task management tool I've ever used. The app is gamified just enough to keep you wanting to complete your tasks.",
"Fantastic tool to help get things done. I love that there's a Todoist app for all the screens / platforms I work on (iOS, Android and Chrome browser.)",
I have tried numerous task manager so far and I must say that Todoist is the one I am sticking too. It has the right mix of ease of use and sophistication. Good job!,
"If you like the free version, buy this app. It's constantly being improved and more integrations with other apps are being added as well. Great value for money. One star lost because integration with my Google calendar could be better.",
Todoist's handling of recurring dates puts it above the many other todo apps I've tried. Former Astrid fans will find a home here.,
The app is great. If you also add something where one can see one's completed tasks for a day or a project then it'll be amazing.,
I looked hard for an app with recurring reminders. Finally found this one. Also like that it links to Google calendar so all deadlines are available at a glance. Best to do list I've come across so far.,
Great tool for organizing your stuff. The points make it a little game and that gives some incentive to compete more chores. Could only wish for the recurrent feature to be a little more simple but that's minor. Give it a try!,
This task manager really helps to focus on achieving goals. Clean design creates great user experience. Looking forward to see more apps from Todoist team.,
Love the interface and its ability to integrate with different platforms. A must have to make everyday even more efficient.,
"While I think it's one of the best to-do list apps I've ever used so far, I believe that notifications and notes are essentials of any to-do list app and should be offered free.",
"Well, this app nags me if I don't get something done. That is good.",
"This is a great productivity app. It has helped me get more accomplished. Being apple to use this on Android, iOS and PC has made syncing all my tasks a breeze. I have only been using this app for a week and a half, I'm sold on a membership.",
Great app for keeping track of day to day missions. I think there needs to be some kind of checklist function or maybe I haven't found it yet? Keep up the good work,
I like the daily reminders and the integration with gmail. Really helps the beseiged keep up.,
"Used with Evernote, Sunrise, todist connected via Taskclone I'm always up to date and have all my resources available 24/7",
I have really been looking for an app like this to get rid of paper lists...really easy and best part is sharing a 'project' with others.,
Great app for staying organized. Not too basic or difficult to use. Would be better with color options for priority events.,
I get frustrated with the dating aspect. Sometimes I just want to do something 3 days in a row but there's no easy way to do that without writing it out 3 times.,
Absolutely love this app! Best one I have found for organization! Totally addicted to it. Has dramatically improved my life! So grateful!  Kuddos to the creators!,
I tried multiple typea including google tasks and any.do but they coulndnt do what todoist does. Ive also used the api to generate a complete digest that includes unscheduled tasks. Five Star Awesomeness. Cheers guys,
"Super easy to use, super handy as well. I never buy apps, but i might have to because i really want those premium features",
"I will definitely pay for upgrading to premium if there's calendar mode. Also there's no ""arrange by date"" at mobile version, making user hard to find out wt to do on a certain date.",
Wonderful! I just need to be able to move multiple tasks between lists at once. I'll go to 5 stars when this is fixed.,
"It really helps with the GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology. I would only suggest some color themes to personalize the app such as ""black"" or ""low light"" etc..",
The app can get better but it is already very good. The service is marvellous!,
"Love it, I can get it on both Apple and Android, easy to use, attractive layout. Just started using it but seems very promising  :)",
"Other apps that offer task tracking etc are just too darn complicated. This is clean, simple and so far reliable! Droid maxx 4.4.4",
"I've been looking for a simple, effective multiplatform app for quite  a while. This one does it. I have installed and Uninstaller so many others. In half a day after testing, playing with the features, reading reviews, I upgraded to Premium. I can create, update, complete, edit tasks regarless of the platform I'm on - seamlessly. And instantly see the updates on another.",
Easy to use and straight to the point. If you can't get stuff done with this app then there's no hope for you.,
"The app is reliable and well put-together, but the features that make it truly powerful or comprehensive are behind the pay wall. I would use the full version over Google Keep and Google Calendar, but not the free version.",
Really love this app. I can put all my tasks here and have them enter themselves on my calendar. There are a lot of other things that I can also do with this app. Works really well with IFTTT.,
"Just too high price for people from some countries, who wants more features, but not any syncing.",
As an IT project  manager  I replaced  my Franklin  planner (20 yr user) with  Todoist. I loved  it  so much  I upgraded. Having  fun using  labels  & creating  queries.,
This game is the best for people who forget. Its even better with the android wear because it's always there and there is no way to forget.,
Does a good job reminding me of things I need to do and upcoming things I need to do.,
"i am happy after one week of use , i am gonna pay for one year premium version, hope get even better,",
Would prefer the premium version if available at a one time cost even if it's a little steep compared to a yearly subscription.,
"The only reason I upgraded to premium was for the Project Template feature it advertises. Come to find out there is no project template feature, it's done through a manual process of creating a template, then downloading, uploading, editing, etc every single time you want to use it. For the free version, I give it 5 stars.",
Easy to use. To keep track of tasks. Can share with my husband or colleagues which make it useful beyond my own personal need. Still figuring out how to use it best and what its full functionality is.,
"Love how easy this app is to use. Especially the number of ways I can access it  (mobile, desktop, browser window). Keeps me in track and allows me to see what's coming up next. Love it.",
"Fantastic. I can't keep a pure GTD workflow, but the beautiful Web experience makes up for it.",
"The only app I've ever paid for, and it wasn't because the free version was hobbled. Superbly well made.",
I've tried many to do apps. Some were too complicated and some were too simple. This has a nice interface and is easy to use.  This one is my favorite so far. Great job!,
I mainly use the 7 day widget view on my home screen to keep track of assignments and other things for the next week. Convenient and simple.,
"I really like the number of platforms it supports. It can be integrated with Outlook, Chrome, Firefox, Android etc. which is really handy. Hope they provide some more features in free version like notes and sub tasks.",
Basic features are enough for my daily life. Perhaps i'll purchase more features in the future,
"Multi platform is a must have today. User friendly, and still FREE for most basic Features.",
It has been working well for me so far. I'm staying on track with my tasks.,
Love this app!  I always forget the things I need to do or buy but now I have one place to jog my memory and keep me on track,
The only thing I would like to see added is the ability to add emails directly to my todoist list as you can with the Gmail add-on,
"Flexible, well integrated with other services and available on all platforms that I use, both personally and professionally.",
This could be one of the most helpful apps you can get. Really saved me from unorganized school work.,
Great job. My favourite to do list app. Ability to customise the theme of the app widget would be good :),
Really keeping me on track with every thing I need to do.,
This works very well for me and helps me make sure I complete my tasks and accomplish my goals.,
"This is more than I ecpected for to do list application, very recomended.",
I've tried a few of these type apps and keep coming back to this one. It's simple and just works.,
Have been using it for for years. Best app in its field and keeps getting better with time. Highly recommended.,
Use it everyday to manage my tasks. Best I've seen so far.,
Love it!  I remember all the little things I used to forget and kick myself about before,
"I've tried about every to do list/productivity app out there and Todoist tops them all. Not too many bells and whistles, (the way I like it),  and it gets the job done.",
"Wonderful app very useful,  only thing yearly subscription price is too much should be reduced.",
"Have tried a couple others, this one is very user friendly, has a good logical and intuitve flow to it. Like the email reminders too! Plan on upgrading soon.",
I've used them all. ToDoIst keeps me on track better than any app I have ever used!,
I really think it does everything i want it to do and then some. And it runs smooth as silk.,
"So much easier to use than Google tasks with reminders, projects, ability to postpone tasks as well.",
Wish I started using todoist sooner.  I use it on both my phone and pc to manage web projects and tasks.  Essential!!,
Downloaded this app about a week ago and I have already observed a jump in my productivity. Highly recommended.,
I like it. It is a good time management app and the karma (game like) system is suited to motivate.,
"I'm still getting acquainted, but so far I love this tool. Thanks Tim Challies @challies for the recommendation.",
Works great.  I love that Todoist has plugins for so many platforms.  So easy to stay organized.,
Great app so far. Beautiful interface! Not thrilled about having to pay for reminders and notes for a to-do list though.,
"Easily integrates with gmail, has a way to organize tasks into various projects, and easy to create new tasks. Love the usability",
"Seriously... The best to-do app! Very clean , easy to use and the Outlook plugin is exactly what I needed. Also, having Karma is very motivating for me.",
"This has helped me organise my day to make sure I get everything done. It's brilliant, give it a go!!",
Super useful and fun to use..as long as u update ur to do tasks dat is :p,
"The best to-do list app I've tried.clean and simple user interface while providing various important functionality. Keep up the good work, todoist team!",
Simple clear app which allows you to manage complex tasks and reminders with ease.,
Very intuitive design. Works smoothly and we'll thought out.,
Tried several task management apps and found this to be the one that met my specific needs.,
"Excellent minimalist UI, very intuitive and quick.  Good for distraction-free task management.",
I have been looking for an app like this for a long time!  It is the perfect to do app,
Oh. Thanks god for that. UX is perfect and functions too.,
All the features are great and work very well. I recommend a premium account.,
"Great app, use it all the time now to stay on top of things!",
It is the best I found so far got keeping track of tasks.,
Great. I can finally put my list into chronological order easily. Simple buttons. Simple design.,
"I use it every day!!!! Extremely helpful app, it keeps me organized and helps make sure nothing falls through the cracks in my busy life! very easy to use!",
Will done. Loved the todoist digest emails.,
Samsung 3. ( I don't really know how to carry on a conversation on here. Can we do this by email?),
"Really convenient, clear cut and easy to use love this app!",
Full featured app with nice look and great support! I think I've found my GTD app finally!,
It's impossible to forget anything by using the app,
Great way to remind yourself about the things you have to execute. Thanks!,
Only complaint is that I wish it were free.,
"Great, simple and easy to use. Gets the job done hassle free!",
I've used a lot of GTD apps and this one is my favorite so far,
Incredibly useful app that syncs perfectly with the windows app.,
I use it for work and home projects. It's easy to use and intuitive.,
Really incredible. Help me so much.thanks,
Still learning. But as advertised with a few surprises.,
"Really easy to use,  and so far has greatly increased my personal productivity.",
Does everything its supposed to do and it does it well!,
Love it so far. It's simple yet powerful little tool,
I love that it integrates with Gmail and has web access.,
Yeah that's me now. Great app!,
"Great app, but hope the build in connections to Microsoft apps.",
Widget is great and easy to use. Makes the android experience very easy and fast reminding,
Its quite a simple no frills app. Quite handy for day to day planning.,
Stunning and effective design. This app is an excellent addition to the organizers phone,
I like this app a lot. Love how you can organize tasks,
It has allí i need and is very simple to use.,
This app is very handy and helpful.  One of the best apps on android.,
It keeps me on track of my daily goals.  Simple and effective.,
Liked this app a lot. Thinking of buy the premium version,
Overall it does have a lot of potential and space for development.,
The free version is quite nice. I like that it syncs with my pc,
I can't imagine not using Todoist.,
"The easiest way to organize task, thoughts with reminders.",
"Does what it's supposed to do, i.e. keep me organized.",
I love this app. It makes my daily life so much easier! Def. recommend this to anyone who holds a tight schedule! Awesome!!! 🙆,
I needed a to do list that is integrated with Gmail and this app fits the bill.,
By far the best personal task management system I have used.,
Very useful app to get things go.,
I've tried many ToDo apps but this one does it all,
An app to keep track of anything that you need to remember,
"I use it for everything, keeps me organized and driven",
Just great. I use it every day. Nice widget too.,
Works as promised.,
The best app purchase ever. Don't look further..,
"Easy to use, simple app.",
"For a successful 2015, this will keep me in track.  Love it.",
"Migrated from another app, I really love the statistics and the home screen widget",
Lacking a lot of features present on the web app.,
It's the best to do list app!,
A good app for me. I glad to use it.,
It does its job.,
Great app - wouldn't be without it now,
Awesome app! One of my favorites.,
"Yes...  Control,  organization,.   projection,  vision All done with this app.  Ui can improve and be more ""simple""",
Does exactly what I was hoping for. Be hard to ask for more.,
Wonderful and easy to use.,
Best todo app I've found so far,
Does everything I want it to do,
Best to do app I found so far,
Use it well and you'll love it.,
"Sehr gutes Tool, das tut was es soll.",
"Just started using this app, but so far it is working well.",
"Very useful application, keep up the good work",
"A great pal, reliable and effective",
Not a very good app but a good app.,
Love it. Super easy to use,
Helped me managing my work and life!!!,
"This app is very useful, I use it everyday",
Becoming quite reliant on this app!,
Like the daily email reminders,
Helps keep lists organised,
Awesome program. Simple yet powerful,
"Simple and clean, easy to use widget",
A great app well executed.,
Hay. Support multi devices. Ko bao gio bi quen may viec lat vat.,

Falta apenas pequenos ajustes para ficar perfeito,

It's a great ap,
No additional permissions required?! Great app,
Excellent!,
Loved it!,
Great across all platforms,
The best out there,
Very useful and simple and straightforward,
"I like that this app doesn't push a philosophy, it just presents you with tools and lets you figure out a system that works for you.",
Only reason to use this app is integration with MS Outlook & Gmail extn with cloud sync. Any do has only gmail extn support without MS Outlook addin.,
Excellent application.,
Add the option of persistent notification?,
Great app.,
It's great,
Great app.,

Использую около месяца на пк и смартфоне. Очень нравится возможность быстро создавать и редактировать таски и подтаски. А система кармы придаёт процессу долю игры.,
Sería de 5 puntos si tuviera forma de trackear el tiempo y fuera mas facil crear listas.,
Super!,

Like it a lot,

"After a year of trial and error with almost all todo apps, I finally settled with this app. Primarily because of the availability  across multiple platforms and semeless sync. Outlook integration makes it easy for me to create task from emails. GTD elements are at its best. Still waiting for better location based reminders and ability to review tasks.",
"It's a great To-Do/Productivity app that motivates you to get things done.  It's not bland nor is it disorganized, you can set reoccurring tasks, earning points to achieve rank gives greater incentive to get things done, it has a blog, and I have enjoyed it so much that I have done away with other To-Do/Productivity apps.  It's that good.",
It helps me plan and pace tasks in an unintrusive way. It is very useful to have my lists on all devices.,
"Great functionality, sync and widget. Easy and quick to add even the smallest task. Doubles as a reminder app and helps me not to forget anything. Karma is a nice incentive too.",
"Todoist let's me easily create, classify, check off, and generally organize and synchronize my tasks. I am very happy with it.",
Great to do list app. The note takung function is really weak. Stick to the lite versipn as the additional functions on the paid version are not worth the price,
I use this app all the time since I downloaded it. I love that I can work from my desk and add tasks via my Web browser and then check them and add more from my phone. Everything stays in sync.,
I've tried several different to-do management apps and Todoist is the one that I have keep using.,
"The app is very slik and really helps get things done. However, it is heavily let down by the widget which comes in large or bigger, wasting a lot of space on a phone screen.",
I want it to work perfectly but I'm not at the point where I've come to rely on it. We'll see. It's working for now.,
"The best task manager I've used. Can do simple lists, projects, notes...very useful because I customize it to fit how I work. Syncs beautifully across my laptop, phone and tablet. You will not be dissapointed.",
"I have been looking for a tool which I could combine with my outlook instead of having the application opened by itself. Todoist covers this need, very nice understandable user interface and many ways of accessing your tasks anywhere at anytime",
"This app works well with my phone and syncs well too, I also have it set to my Sunrise Calendar but Todoist doesn't notify me when my task needs to be done, or over do. What's up with that?",
I love the usefulness of this app and its simplicity.  I use it everyday for both business and personal.,
"Powerful, simple, and connected. The only todo app you need!",
"Very good for making a list but absolutely nothing else, if you want to even just view compleleted items you need to pay for premium at a astonishing $29.99 a year... So yeah...",
Todoist has all the features that I need on all the platforms that I use and it's simple to use.,
Takes care of all tasks and works amazingly well with Moto360!,
Have just gone with the pro version.  Liking it!,
Notifications and calendar integration could be better,
Best among all todo app,
Expect a bit of a learning curve.,
"Easy to use, good features",
The to do list for my phone that I am actually using!,
Improve my productivity,
Great app thanks,
"ToDoist easy to use and provided a comprehensive yet simple interface. Depending on how deep one wants to go, there is almost everything that one could ask a ToDo List app to do.  Certain features are locked out in the free edition, which is a pain. But I believe the subscription fee is not too much for the functionality this app provides on a whole.",
"I have been using it only for a few months now. I found it excellent. I had been using several other to do list apps in the past, this is the best I have come across so far. Have tried most of the features. Have used the calendar sync, gmail link and also recurring events scheduling. Today I am dependent on Todoist for my acivities",
"I don't like that this app doesn't allow the user to block out time periods. It lets you input start times but not end times. Voice recognition is also really buggy. Other than that, I love this app. Great mix of a user friendly interface with enough customization to fit anyone's scheduling demands.",
After trying this out for a couple of days I was ready to put my whole list of to dos in it. I was worried because I was putting in the entire Sidetracked Home Executives in it and didn't want to be wasting my time if I decided against it. No waste. (I suggest if you do it then it is easiest to add it on the computer to start with.) Love having it and my other things on it. So. Simple to add things when they come to mind. Easy to switch things if I need to.,
"This is the best task app,  I have used.   I have never been able to find app that worked seamless between all my desktop and other devices.  Using app is easy and it gives you great daily information to keep your task in order (better than Outlook and Google).  Highly recommend.",
"Across all platform feature is  seamless. Ui is clean.I still do however prefer cal where you see dates and events.rather than just tasks. And tasks like call, message and email will be linked in within the app. I wish I didn't buy this despite it being a good app. Could be better.",
"This is the best to-do list app I have ever came across. I expect one more thing in the free version, ability to take notes. No need to upload files. But put some notes into to-dos is really helpful. So I hope you will understand. And I'm hoping to buy Todoist as soon as possible. :)",
"This app is far from perfect, but it is the best todo app available. I spent quite a time evaluating all available todo apps and basically this one is the only thing that comes close to being acceptable. The major benefits are the projects with sub-projects, the labelling and the priorities, but mostly the extremely good possibilities to get reminders for tasks that are due or near to become due. However what is needed is a better integration with Outlook mail and especially Outlook calendar.",
"I've tried, and tried, and tried to get a solid to do system up and running for years. So far this has been the easiest  tool yet. It feels like it gets out of my way. It's everywhere I need it to be for capturing items, gmail, chrome, phone and tablet. The IFTTT integration allows me to automate task creation and scheduling.  My only desire is to have Start Dates that I can filter on as well.  That would earn that 5th star in a hurry.  That and maybe theme support, a dark theme would save my eyes at 3am.",
"Todoist is an application which provides you functionality, not novelty, a brilliant yet simple design for the application makes it easy and smart to navigate, being as lite as it is it barely dents your storage space and really does make an impact on your day to day lives. Categorization of events, choosing dates and times, setting alerts are extremely simple yet useful touches to this brilliant application. Also, the reward system will push kids to finish all their tasks too, which is brilliant.",
"I have gone through every list app on the Play Store. This was one o the best. I have been looking for a list app to sort my Christmas lists, shopping list, wish list, birthday lists, and to-do list. The sub lists make it easy to do that! I love that you can put a due date and also a reminder in advance. I love how you can share lists with multiple accounts. An option to view all tasks with a due date in a calender is the only feature that could make this app better. Or maybe folders to put your lists into.",
"I love this app, I use it every day on all my random projects around the house, for my car modifications, and all my hobbies, including just random small projects that tend to pop up.  The only drawback is the monthly fee to use the app continuously. I wouldn't put a huge price tag on an app like this, but if it were $10-$20, I'd buy it. In the meantime, I'll have to enjoy all the free features as is.",
"Wanted an app to sync to my laptop and emails for business and personal. This is it. Looked at. and trialled many but this was the most versatile without having to waste lots if time inputting tasks. Now I don't have to fret about task priority, I do that the night before, I just do them. V happy",
"One of the best to do apps out there (and I've tried a lot). Great cross-platform support, great design. For some weird reason there's no way to specify a start  date for your tasks. Also you can only give your tasks one of 4 priorities. Despite these issues, I would still highly recommend Todoist.",
"I use this app to help me remember all my assignments. I like the option to create different sections, like different classes. I wish it connected to my calendar more easily so I could have a complete schedule, and I also wish it had the ability to add a time to an assignment. But overall it's a solid app. I haven't had it glitch at all, as other similar apps have for me.",
"The best thing for me about this app is the ability to download onto all of my devices. I have a desktop, iPad and android versions, so it doesn't matter which device I am using at the time. I can always post a to do and check my list throughout the day. It could be more involved as some posts have articulated, but if if you are searching for a simple app that can help keep you organized, this is perfect.",
"This is a great multiplatform To Do list management tool with lots of nice features. It sometimes fails to sync properly between platforms though. If I log out and back in again it seems to fix it. Apart from that, it's perfect! This is software I don't mind paying for!",
"Being that Google Calendar has become a mess, this is a great alternative. It edits Google Calendar, so it will still allow Google Now to function. Overall a decent app, but doesn't bring anything new or innovative. Could use an overhaul on design, but that's form not function.",
"Fantastic, comprehensive Organizational Tool to help me get from the beginning to an end of a Project (and all my honey-dos in between). If it could install in Google Calendar, that would push it over the top. Yes, premium costs $28 for the year. But I would lose that much in productivity if I didn't have it. Now if other people had it, the collaboration would be off the charts.",
This app is amazing. I use the web and mobile versions to get the most out of the program. It's so streamlined and has more than doubled my daily productivity. Even without being able to set end dates on tasks this app deserves five stars.,
"Many of the tasks at my work are static in nature.  But with the friction of our growth, many more dynamic tasks or situations are surfacing.  We are not yet large enough to implement full automation.  Todoist allows me to bridge the gap of a historically manual minded workplace to an automated minded work place.  Hopefully some day we outgrow Todist, but for now this is exactly what we/I need!",
Liked it very much. Actually this is the only app for which I submit review (I'm too lazy in such issues). Because it deserves that!  My only desire would be to see more visible separation line between the tasks. Otherwise they seem to be visually mixing with each other. But this does not stop me giving deserved 5 stars. Thank you. Well done!,
Great app with strong widgets. No email add in free version unlike competitors. Biggest gripe is bad back button support. If I go from Inbox to a project and hit back I am often closed out of program. It should back to my list or the Inbox or AT LEAST ask if I want to exit instead of leaving out.,
"1.It is so hard to find the completed tasks and undo that to bring them back to today again. 2. It is not possible to create a task with a due date and recurring. You can only set a due date. and wait until the day comes to make it a recurring task. (AKA Start-End date feature is missing) 3.you can't see/check the sub tasks in the widget. 4. the Karma only gives you a general report on your performance. but if you want to know how you did in 1 project, you can't.5.not all query commands explained",
"Been looking for a way to organize my life.  Between this app and the website i think I've found a great way to do it.  I haven't been using it that long but so far it fits my needs exactly.  Personal, work, rental homes...it's helping me keep it all organized.",
"It's a very minimal approach, but it works great! You can set custom times for your tasks, get reminders, postpone or snooze where needed and even get email reminders and task tracking. It works well for letting me jot out what tasks I want to complete and doing them",
"It's the best task-list app I've used - doesn't have all the advanced features I would like, but is simple to use and has that reliable feel to it. A big negative is that there has been no words (that I know of) about android wear support, which I find very unpleasing for a paid service - wear support would hugely lower the discipline needed to work my task list on smaller tasks. I feel wear support should be a given for Todoist and unfortunately I will have to switch to something else if support is not added very soon :(",
"I find the app incredibly useful for someone who organizes and methodically steps through accomplishing things they feel responsible to complete.  Input is available from whichever platform I'm currently employing - notebook,  including Web browser or Microsoft Outlook or  Android phone.  I can set reminders on days and times of my choice.  I'd love to have more integration with Google calendar and the task and note applications accessible with the S pen on my Galaxy Note 3.",
"Todoist likes to pretend to be a free app, but to suggest that the free version is anything less than a trial is downright dishonest. Some pretty fundamental features, such as task reminders, are only available to premium users. What's worse, Todoist Free doesn't highlight which features are premium until you try to use them, meaning free users are constantly thwarted by popups asking them to spend money.  Rather than simply sell you the app, Todoist asks you to pay a sizable $29/year subscription fee, which in my view is a big downside compared to other similar apps.   All that griping set aside, I have to admit that it is a quality app. It's intuitive, simple, and highly customizable. I did a lot of shopping around an this is the only productivity app that does everything I want. I'm just hoping a cheaper alternative will emerge in the near future.",
"I was and still am a Google Keep user. Love the UI, but for my planning needs it was a bit too basic. That's where I found Todoist after trying a multitude of other apps.  What I love about todoist is how versatile it is for recurrent tasks. It offers far more features than other apps in it's free version and is fluid, clean, and syncs well across various platforms. Highly recommended!",
Love the app in all its effectiveness and in all its simplicity but I wish there would be a smaller widget that doesn't need to occupy so much space in the home screen.  A 4x1 would be perfect. With this I would give it the remaining star.,
"I love the product and the app. Todoist is awesome. Only reason for four stars is that it's a bit slow, and I've had one or two tasks lost because I entered them in the middle of the sync. Otherwise it would be five! Go todoist. My favorite gtd app, both on android and the web.       Edit 2014/11/25: up to 5 stars (from four originally) for many updates and improvements. The app is smooth and quick. Todoist keeps improving as few other services do.",
"I have used many to-do apps, programs, and systems, but this one strikes the right balance between simplicity and features. It doesn't get in the was of what you are trying to accomplish - actual work. It can be used as a simple to-do list or a project manager. Some reviewers will concentrate on what it doesn't do, but it's strength is that it is as close to managing DA's GTD system (which is basically managing lists) as any I have come across. Thanks for great app at great price.",
"Great features, but without the $29/year subscription you can't even get basic things like reminders. I can't see not even being able to get reminders, so ill stick to the stock calendar/task list on my phone which has reminders.",
"I've used a lot of to do apps and this is the best one so far. The free version does everything most people will need but the premium is cheap, has a few genuinely useful features and let's you build up more complex workflows. Still developing, I had to ask about the p:[project] tag for filtering as it's not on their help page yet. When I signed up for premium I actually got an email from them asking if there was anything I wanted to know and the response was quick and accurate.",
"Love, love, love this app!  I can organize my days with repeating tasks and manually arrange my tasks in the order I want.  Has search so I can find tasks, too.  These first two must haves I've not found in any other app.  In heaven!  Thank you! :-)  All these features are without the paid features, to boot.  Highly support and recommend to everyone.  Nice touch is that it sends my agenda via email as a backup.  These guys nailed it.  Thank you, thank you.",
"Since todoist, my life has become a whole lot easier. I can fit a structure that suits me, or anyone for that matter, and can really get into the detail of the complexities of both my working and lesuire lifestyle. Phenomenal compatibility means everything electronic I need, has todoist available.",
"This is a great app that helps you to remember what you need to do! The only reason I am rating it a 4 instead of a 5, is that the date and time setting features are somewhat hard to use. If available, I would have rated it a 4.5. I'd like to see an easier way, but now that I've gotten use to it, it's great! The best part is that you not only get push notifications, but emails too. You are also encouraged to complete tasks so that you can get a higher rating.",
"Now everyone is going to want different things in a To-do List app, but after trying many, many, other apps, I've found ToDoist to be the best one for my needs. It works great, has useful features, and syncs with an one website so I can use it on my phone and computer. Love it.",
"I usually am juggling a gazillion projects and it is hard to keep track of them all - especially on paper - everything is constantly shifting and changing.  Todo keeps me on track, and allows me to re-schedule things easily.  I even upgraded because it was so helpful.  Would rather spend $30/year on upgrade than the same amount on a bound paper agenda that is difficult to update and doesn't come with all the productivity analysis tools, or the ability to share todo lists with colleagues or team-members.",
"I have been using it for a few weeks and of all the To Do list type apps, I like this the best so far. Too bad it's not really ""free"" since all the feature I need only comes with paid version.",
"The secret to a great To-do app is frequent use. Daily use. Todoist is quick, easy and uncomplicated enough to use without thinking. Sorting is as easy as drag-n-drop. Device syncing is bullet proof. This app is in my Top 3. Simply Priceless.",
"It's easy to enter stuff you want to do once, not as easy as I'd like for repeating appointments. (Their ""natural"" language input isn't always the way I talk. I'd like to see a GUI.) The reminders and day to day stuff work great. You've just got to learn to re-sort the list after checking off a recurring task in the web app, or you may end up checking of the next instance without noticing.    I switched from ToodleDo and find Todoist a step in the right direction.",
Love it! Gmail app. Chrome app. Browser support. Android app. IPad app. Perfect way to integrate across devices. Would be great to have BlackBerry support though. Also Android interface is a bit cludgy for indenting. But this fits my needs best of all the options I've considered!,
"It's the best Task (or even project) Management app I've used till date. Believe me I've tried millions! But the only missing feature is admin rights. Anyone can change the deadline, anyone can assign a task to anyone else. I'll give it 5 stars only after you add this. And do this soon before I shift to another app. Still I'm grateful to the team for creating such a wonderful app. Thanks.",
"They hope you will try it then upg to premium. OK. But when I did an uninstall the account lived on, with regular reminders work is overdue.  Nuisance, be warned.",
This has helped my family and I truly get things done.  I myself can finally relax.  I use it personally and professionally and will be buying it this month.  I would like to see a calendar layout and a team management capability in the future.,
Ease of use should be THE top priority of any developer.  The designer achieves this with a style and feel that I find attractive.  Many could benefit from the example here.,
"Love this app. Literally makes me so organised, I've surprised myself. I love the ability to share task lists. Looking forward to android wear compatibility",
I was little surprised when I  didnt find place to add time for my task. For ex I have task1 and I need to do it at 5 pm but default time for all tasks is 9 am. I don't know what is the thought process went behind while developing this app. Utter crap!,
"For a free app, this is the best list making tool I've used to date!  If you do want an app that has impressive list making capabilities (levels of importance, categories, labels, filters, recurring tasks, projects, assigning tasks to different people, etc.) and you want it to be clean and easy to use at the same time, you've found it! I have at least a free trial of the premium features and they do make a big difference, so maybe having to pay for those is the one downside.",
After years of using text based lists and dabbling in to do apps this is the first I've stuck with and first I've paid premium for.,
"I have always been an extremely disorganized person, mostly because I forget about things until the deadline is right there. With todoist I'm finally on top of my life and it's sooo much less stressful!",
Great for people who are constantly on the move and have a lot of todo's and ideas to organize. And the reports let you see how effective you've been at getting things done so you can set goals to improve.,
"A little restrictive in the free version. But if you like it, it's well worth buying for full features.",
Love the sharing capabilities and multi-device support. Has kept me more organized and less forgetful. Highly recommend.,
Using it more and more it's great. I used to write out my lists on paper now I can save the trees and still be orgnised,
"The app does its job, but it has its share of bugs. Using the same check mark icon for both saving and deleting items is a textbook UI sin. ""Done"" as ""Save"" and ""Done"" as ""Delete task"" are different actions! It's way too easy to ""swipe away"" a task when trying to scroll the list. It's good there is an undo message, if I notice what happened, but I had more than one accident when an item was lost and I didn't realize it. I had a big mess when I switched the phone and the timezone at once - first I had duplicates that I deleted, then some items disappeared. I'm staying with Todoist for now, but I'm actively looking for something better.",
One of the best app I have come across. Awesome is just a meagre word to describe this app. Thank you team for your brilliant work. Really appreciate it.,
"Helps you keep focussed on doing the things that matter. Unlike some other to do apps, easy to use and doesn't become a distraction.",
"The tool is pretty good, bit one functionality I am missing is dependency. A task can only start if the task is finished.  Please add that to make thia a the best tool seen so far",
"This is a great app for planning and organising projects as well as making lists. Can also sync with other phones, computers and tablets. Very handy.",
"Really like this app. Only suggestion would be able to delete completed quotes. I like to keep completed tasks for a period of time and it would be nice to be able to delete them when needed.  Other than that,  this is the best tasks app I've used!",
Great program for keeping on top of all aspects of work and home life.  Sharing lists makes coordination easy and the karma system implicitly encourages frequent utilization. This is a staple app.,
"I love this app because it has: progress chart, priorities. That's it. Not as nice looking as wunderlist but I like how it works and run more than wunderlist. Better function",
"Pros: Functionality & ease of use. Cons: Widget disappears after phone is turned off & on, and its doesnt handle time zone changes well.",
Great to do list app. Can't figure out a way to make the widget look good but that doesn't take away from the sweet core functionality of the app.,
"Very helpful for getting things done.  I usually use the website from my computer, but this is nice to have when that is not available.",
One of the best apps for daily task management. Tremendous help. Needs a feature to include editable start time and duration of tasks.,
"Super organized, love how it works, and is definitely a big help. I just wish some of the more useful And important things were free.",
"I didn't have much faith that I would actually use this. But it's designed to encourage  you to, and it has a Gmail plug in.",
This app is a near perfect blend of complexity (such as Due Today) and simplicity (such as AnyDo) when it comes to To Do Lists. Haven't looked back since making the switch.,
"The app is great , I have found a treasure , but when you block some features because you want money , I feel how greedy you are",
"If you want to set a reminder  for example,  you have to go premium for €23 a year. The max I pay is €12 a year for a subscription.  A greedy app who wants to make €100.000 a month. Good luck.",
"Been using todoist for 3 years now and love it. App simply makes my to do list more accessible. Nothing groundbreaking, but really no improvements needed to something that works as well as todoist does.",
"The app looks really, good but most of the good functionalities like creating categories for tasks, setting time alarm, reviewing productivity are all unavailable for free version. The paid version is heavily priced at 1750 rupees every year. That is too much for a to-do application. Request to developer - show some ethics.",
This app has really made a difference to my working life. The premium version has been worth it to link with my emails. Highly recommended.,
Keeps track if my while day no pressure with memory.lol,
I don't often give 5 stars but this app deserves it. Superb in every way. Available on almost every known platform. Flawlessly syncs across all of them. Love the integration with Gmail Web portal.,
"Use this over android, iOS, mavericks and windows and love it.  One star off as I sometimes have sync issues across devices.",
So far so good. I tried several organizer apps this week and this one initially seems to be my favorite. 4 stars for now.,
"I had tried many productivity apps, finally i concludes this is the best and what i want.. I hope next improvement is adding some graphic visuals especially in karma feature",
"Would be 5 stars, but recently items have been moving due dates for some reason. This is a really big problem for me because I use this app to schedule due dates for homework.",
My favorite to do list app. The only request I have is for it to sync to Google calendar. If that is already a feature then I can't find it.,
I have really tried to utilize ask that Todoist has to offer. I like it so far. Course platform syncing is a definite plus. Recommended.,
Todoist is  the  first  to do app I don't  give  up  after  two  weeks.  It makes  my  life  much  easier to  organize  and  the  integration with  IFTTT is  awesome.,
An undisputed simple user interface but powerful capability beast.,
Todoist is an excellent personal task management application. I do not mind paying a premium when an app can seamlessly sync across multiple platforms.,
Simple. Syncs everything. Recurring tasks is a must. Wish there was a way to show a task that went undone.,
This is among one of the most easy apps to use and hold me accountable for. I added my things to do and delete it when I am done. Keep me on the right track with my busy life.  Thank you!,
"So easy to use, and works across all my devices.",
Having the ability to add notes or a description to each todo would be handy. But other than that I can't fault it. Great job.,
"Only thing I'm having difficulty is with making a ""daily due time"" where the task will reset at that time.",
"I am a very begginer of todoist, but i thing is nessesery to organize daily tasks. This app helps.",
I use it to keep up with my college assignments and when they're do. It's works quite well for me.,
"It is one of my favorite apps I have ever come to know about.. Kind of "" post it "" but much better",
"A little confusing on the very first initial step after downloading in terms of modification of tasks and colors and adding projects but once that's done it seems fine. Also why isn't a physical check box right next to the list item?? It sounds pretty childish but that style is just more natural for me to check things off! Also, another gripe, it's just not practical in some instances. You add something, and unless you put a date next to it, it disappears forever until you remember to check it (what's the point then?)",
"Very full-featured todo list functionality. I had a lot of requirements for my todo list, but this app covered them all perfectly.",
"Too cumbersome to task review--too many clicks to punt tasks to a day in the next week or to file a task away in a project. Missing easy ""but first"" functionality found in my last TODO app.",
"Nice app, helps keep the day busy. Missing time reminders in free versind (like the one Any.do has)",
This app has been one of the best to do list I've used. Quick and user friendly.  I combined my daily cleaning with required tasks.,
I first fell in love with todoist back in the days of widgets on igoogle. Now I live on the app. &lt;3,
Add a feature to set date range for a task. ASAP.,
Months ago I gave it 2 stars. Now I can't organize my day without it. Excellent app.,
Been using about 6 months and I really rate this app. Something that I use on a continuous basis. Love it and recommend it.,
"Some sign-up problems, but working now. I like the date entry options, and ever-present help for it",
"You need the paid version for it to be useful, with reminders. But it is easy to get started and I love the integration with my Google Calendar.",
Great product.. Just needs  way to share a specific task rather than whole project. Otherwise the best I've tried,
"I've used them all, trello, omnifocus, RTM, etc. Todoist strikes the right balance between speed, features and simplicity for me.",
"Blasts Wunderlist and the rest out of the water. * Widget can't be resized in width * Sub-tasks are a counter intuitive mess * We need to be able to say ""Add milk to shopping list"" on Android Wear  * Interface options could be a little more intuitive, like the same 'tick' icon is confusingly used for both 'Save new task' and 'Mark task complete'!",
All the features I want and the customizability to allow me to make it not annoying to use.  Also I recommend the premium version! The alerts are a must have.,
No other app has made me as productive as todoist! I have zero complaints and use all the features.,
"I have tried virtually every one of them, and this is the best one. Definitely worth the $30 premium price.",
"My suggestion, in Settings please add an Option about Syncing, option to choose Sync only when connected at Wifi.. To minimize data cost.",
"The product is easy to use and fairly intuitive. What I like most is the number of different ways you can group your tasks. So I do some tasks based on time, some on priority, and others by category.  I find I'm getting more stuff done.",
Great app that helps me be organised whilst on the move. Only minor problem is that phone app doesn't always seem to keep up with completed tasks on my other devices. Other than that it's great!,
Good simple interface. Unfortunate that basic functionalities are on premium version. It should be free for single users perhaps Paid for companies,
Love the ease and muti-platform use of Todoist.  Integration with Gmail is so very awesome.  Clears my inbox in a productive way.,
Not a lot to it. Wish you could have it alarm you at certain time/date. Like the different categories but very simple too bad couldn't be more detailed..pop out a little more,
"Absolutely great app. I used to use Things on iOS, this I've is comparable. I love the feature of getting reminded via sms.",
"I have tried many other apps and paid multiple times but always left less than satisfied. This app syncs flawlessly across android, Ipad and mac. Has everything need and nothing you don't.",
Thanks for the great app. I'll move to it. One improvemeny can be added to make tasked marked done but not to make them disapear. Also it is easy to mark a task as done by mistake!,
"Used it for a few days and I like the GTD implementation, multi-platform support, and offline feature. Subtasks feature is a buggy though so I hope it gets fixed in future releases.",
You can rely on this application as personal assistance. I have been used it for a week with full control on my tasks. I would recommend this application to be installed for all mobile users specially for Business and Work related.,
I uninstalled Any.Do for this only to find out that task reminding feature is for premium subscribers,
I go to school full time and I work full time.  This app along with my calendar makes sure I don't forget anything.,
"Love the simplicity,  quickness,  and ability to share list.  Grocery list for the household has never been easier.",
Todoist is a great way to stay organized and keep track of all the things I need to do.,
Still unresolved on android. The day switch for karma updates.,
Intuitive design that has managed to keep up with the Google Design guidelines (hoping for a Material Design update). Great syncing and list sharing capabilities. Solid tool that I use daily.,
"This app is easy to learn and works great. Right now I only use it for work purposes, but I plan on using it for personal things in the future.",
"It's so easy to use,I love the design and also that I can have it on my computer & phone.",
My husband and I were struggling to keep straight who was taking care of which task.  This has helped us quickly identify all of our tasks and get them done jointly.,
"As someone who has lists for my lists, this app keeps me organized. It allows me to sort items by date as well as by ""project."" So I am able to sort my lists by category, such as my shopping list, or by date, such as my ASAP list. It works well on all of my devices and has a user friendly interface.",
"Best Task organiser l've used, very straightforward and easy to use but at the same time has some very powerful features. Effective integration with calendar. Great support.",
"to get things done and seek out more goals, to lead a successful, productive life. Thanks for your help!",
The app structure is very simple and elegant. Only those functionalities that one actually needs and uses are present. Very efficient in managing truckloads of tasks. I only wish that the reminders were a little more effective than they currently are. Kudos to the developers!,
Clean interface. Works exactly how I want it to. Best app I have tried out of dozens in my search.,
I installed this but in this app no Time Setting option to remind me at the Right Time :(,
"Task trees/Grouping/Subtasks are implemented pretty well but tasks don't have start dates, only due dates. Fifth star with some improvements.",
Extremely useful and very intuitive. I have integrated this this into Sunrise  Calendar and now I can see tasks and events in the same calendar.  How cool is that.,
"I have to say, this is really good. I am actually getting much more done as a result of using it.",
Can get the same functionality for free elsewhere. Having no reminders makes the free app useless.,
"I wish it wasn't a subscription,  but a one time purchase basis cause I too broke to buy it at a college student, but it's a great tool!",
Work at sci wood work everyone uses it. It allows use to plan and do as well to track what have been done at the shop or away.don't.,
"really enjoy the UI's simplicity. it syncs to all my devices, allowing me to check off my tasks anywhere. Also nice to share many to-do projects with friends and family.",
"Liked the free version, and found it very useful. Upgraded to pro for a few of the features. One in specific is the ability to add attachments to a task. Now when a bill or mail that requires action comes in, we add a task with its due date, take a picture of the bill, attach it, and toss the mail in the recyclables. No more piles of mail sitting around!",
"This app is hands down one of the best I've used. It's so much more than a to do list. It also has an awesome web client to manage your tasks. I love the karma points, they really keep me motivated. Todoist is awesome!",
"Many people complain about the process and don't find it easy or intuitive; ignore that if you look for a GTD app, this is certainly one of the best.",
Todoist has helped me organize my busy life and eliminate my email mess.,
"A clean, straightforward, easy to use, productivity app. Well worth the yearly cost to support the Devs and keep this app moving forward.",
Minimalist.. It keeps you focused on your task rather than distracted on features that aren't really necessary.. I like how it has integrated with other apps using IFTTT,
Great application that can be a simple or as powerful as you need.  Some people balk at the subscription model but for less than the cost of one PC/MAC application you get an incredibly powerful app on just about any device and OS that you own.  Great bargain and highly recommend!,
I use this app to share to do with my husband.  He is now way much more productive^-^,
It's great that I don't have to set a date on tasks - I really need that to keep track of all those little things I need to get done. Great app!,
Didn't think I'd get into working with lists of tasks but Todoist works really well,
Simple yet effective.Great for jotting down things to do when the memory isnt quite what it used to be.Still a few tweeks to go until its a great app.,
"Compare to other apps, this one is more simple and beautiful, but also powerful at the same time. Its amazing when you have a business account with sub-projet & sub-task enabled. With this, won't need others anymore.",
"he app lacks the simplicity and effectiveness of the Todoist Pro by Numa, shame that no longer works, as the official app isn't working on both of my android devices.",
"I started using todoist for work only, now it manages all my todos for home and work. The organization by projects then priority is fantastic! Highly recommend for anyone looking to get their tasks organized and get a boost in productivity.",
After the latest update there are some issues like involuntarily task duplication.. I have a Moto G so plz would you fix this bug in the next update?,
"This is a great To-do list.  It's nice and simple with the ability to prioritize.  I might upgrade if it were not a yearly subscription.  Also, I'd like to see a calendar when I open the app.",
Quite powerful with how you enter dates and recurring dates.,
Very useful todo app across all the platform. It is really help me make things done.,
Get the most out of Todoist by downloading the Todoist Chrome desktop and GMail apps! Another pro tip: tasks with assigned dates sync with your Google Calendars.,
"I have a lot of different projects that I work on each with their own subtasks. This is the best app I could find that allowed you to have categories, tasks and subtasks. Really nice user interface as well. Dead simple.  Highly recommended.",
Love this app! I type up my list every night for the next day and have yet to miss a task! I teach so at times my days can be VERY busy. This app makes creating a daily to do list simple and effective!,
Would hv given 5 stars if reminder was a free feature like evernote provides.,
"A great to do list app. I like it better than AnyDo, and web/mobile interoperability is wonderful.",
"Very nice app. No cluttered screens, just what I need to see and do.",
"This is much better than I expected. The sync works great, and the shared task lists are the best idea. IFTTT integration, too, that's fantastic. Would benefit from being movable to SD, though.",
Simple but allows recurring tasks and the ability to sort by date due or by category. Everything I needed,
Use it everyday to get things done. Love it. Simple and works.,
Feature rich and simple to use. The karma system is really motivating.,
"Got tired of Any.do. This app is a ""must have"" for GTD users.",
Keeps me on top of my lists of things to do.,
I better use Wunderlist over this app because everything is free there. At least keep the reminders free so that many people can afford. In the next update if I don't get at least one paid feature free I am switching to Wunderlist.,
"I love that you can add email as tasks. i wish they could extend this feature to as many email services as possible (yahoo,  Outlook)... This app is the best in its field",
"Very intuitive, yet powerful. I'm a big fan of productivity software, and this is one of the best.",
"A very powerful productivity software, it's built in a way that will keep you organized naturally.. I was not thinking in getting the premium version but in the end I did it..",
"Love that it syncs to all the devices I use! Plus a web interface! Very powerful, never fails me. The features are also really awesome! The features of the free version are like the features of other apps' paid ones",
Don't know how I lived without it. Nice job!,
"Still working things out, but looks to be the pick on an Android device.",
"Works really well across all my devices and platforms and is easy to use, flexible and powerful.",
It is the best to do list app I've ever had.. I love that it will keep sending you reminders each day till you get it done!!,
"Thus far,  I love the app! My only complaint is the fact that you have to pay for premium for, reminders? I thought that would be a standard feature with a tasking application.  Otherwise this is a great app.",
"No notifications, no sound. Whats the purpose of creating a task when you dont get any notification? Waste of time",
"They keep coming out with great new features like the location reminders. I've been using this app for quite sometime and got a premium membership for the attachments feature I needed on work tasks I was completing. The only feature request I would like would be to allow the option of the ""Parent"" Project or the highest main project to, instead of being a separate project, list all sub-projects recursively.",
"Finally - thanx to ToDoist -  I have all my todo's in one central place, instead of scattered around in Gmail as stared email, Outlook tasks, and various lists!",
Works as described across multiple devices using different platforms. I use it every day and I highly recommend it.,
"Simple to use and straightforward, nothing more needed rally though perhaps an audio reminder might be handy for times or locations as a prompt",
"It's the best app ever, help me a lot to remind things and with IFTTT app it's the best integration",
I'm still a novice but this seems really good.,
Easy to use and has a beautiful interface. Replaced Wunderlist for me and I have not looked back.,
This is a nice app. All I ask for is a dark theme then I'll give 5 stars.,
No ability to alter the widget spoils what is otherwise a great app,
"Using web login, iOS, and Android devices as well as Chrome and Gmail plugins it works seemlessly and uniformly acrossed each! Also I understand there will be integration with Evernote and that will be amazing!",
Very simple and handy app for manage your full day planning and reminder. Highly recommended app,
"I especially like that my phone, desk top & ipad are all in sync. It is easy to use & no more post its everywhere!",
"Very useful app , it will help you all the day to do every thing at work , home , shopping etc.....",
"Highly effective, intuitive interface works well once you grasp the concept.",
"I am finally taking control of my life, and Todoist is the perfect so for that.",
I'd love some color customization but the apo is simple and brings just what I need when it comes to *listing what I need to do along the week*,
"Keeps me on point with all my to-dos from shopping lists to appointments. I love the reminders and the ability to ""snooze"" them. Great app!",
"Nice apps, it will always remind you when you forget about your plan.",
When you get old like me this type of app really really helps you!,
The best task and project management app around.  Easy to use and interfaces with Email and any phone. Simply great.,
"Gives you loads more for free than a lot of others. Glad I've swapped, it's superb!",
Easier and less hassle to use Gmail or calendar for reminders and lists,
Still not used all the features yet so could well improve,
"It's simple to use and easy to organize daily tasks.  I've only been using it for a week so far, but that's enough time for me to know if I like or don't like an app. This one is definitely a keeper!!",
"It's a great for Everyday, Special times of the year and/or just not enough hours in the day! The more I use it, I see me getting closer to purchasing the upgrade!",
Very flexible and easy to use. Great for people who want a cross platform app.,
"I love this app. If you're disciplined to use it faithfully, it's simply magnificent. It's simple, it's intuitive, it's flexible, and it's available on about any platform you can think of. I'm a premium user simply because it's worth it to invest into this system.",
"Finally, the to do app to beat all to do apps. I have tried them all, and this does everything, simply and beautifully.",
Love the ease of use and the simplistic user interface.,
"Wonderful at managing multiple projects for work, home, etc. Great week view, project view, and filtering.",
Its simple and keeps to motivated to get stuff done,
I need it to pop and yell at me to do the things I assign myself so I dont forget,
Best little list yet! Love how well it does its job. Has become my go to list app.,
Very simple and clean design... Let's you get your done without distracting advertising,
Simple to use. Love that I can use it with Chrome and Windows as well. Found it syncs better than Wunderlist.,
"Easy to use, intuitive, with nice colour coding. No complaints here, ads are unobtrusive.",
Stop waiting and get things done!,
"This is the To Do checklist I've been waiting for. Thank you. One suggestion.  On location based alerts, allow for more time frames. Currently you allow for on arrival or departure.  How about ""X minutes after arrival""? But I love the app even without that option.",
"Been looking for a good to do list app, and this one has been perfect",
"Would like it you would give like everyweek schedule plan-ability , never the less it still iz awesome",
"This app has helped me gain control over all the little tasks that make up the day/week/month.  My work flow is very non-linear and full of interruptions (that usually result in new tasks that need to be handled).  This app allows me to add,  move,  prioritize and delegate tasks using a very simple and intuitive interface.  While the interface is ""simple"" there are plenty of features when you need them. Great app!",
Enough ways for everyone to be able to use it to get their tasks done.,
Just the right feature set for me. Keeps getting better and better,
"The best todo-app. Yes, costs some for the premium version, but it is definitely worth it.",
It is easy to use and I am able to update on my computer as well as on my samsung.,
Its a nice app....very nice to keep oneself organized and nt forget the simple tasks to be done,
I don't know what I would do without it.,
Only downside is that the Windows PC application of this app doesn't work properly.,
Simple to use yet flexible enough to do what most everything I need.,
Occasionally the synching function doesn't work. But otherwise this app is super great.,
I have tried many apps and none compare.,
It's a great app that is for free but needs a some enhancements to perfectly serve is purpose.,
"Long time researching and that's it, the most suitable app for me. Thanks!",
I use it daily for personal and work tasks. Great stuff!,
Fantastic App cause it syncs and upgrades the Tasks between my Laptop &  Mobile at great Ease.,
"Simple, easy to use and it works as it is supposed to. Can't complain about that. :)",
This is a great app. The UI is very clean and minimal. The app syncs well with the online version. Overall a great productivity app!,
Design keeps the focus on getting  things done.,
"Great product. One of, if not the best to-do app out there...",
"App is good,  but the location search isn't up to much compared to any do. Still like this better though.  It's not a deal breaker, just a thing I'd like the Dev 'ToDo'.  See what I did there?",
Not overly confusing or convoluted,
Way better than any do....I would totally recommend it,
I use this with my husband and my personal assistant. Works perfectly!,
Helpful to keep multiple to do lists and projects for individuals all in one place.,
It would have been better if the premium version was cheaper!,
This is a good app having easy interface. Must have for all,
This app is the answer for all my needs of a to do list. Amazing!,
Thank you for making my life easier more than ever 😃,
I use the DashClock Todoist extension and Outlook plug-in.,
"Collaboration, task management, scheduling and reminder makes life easy.",
"Works great, does everything I need.",
"This is really helpfull aa, one should must hv it.",
Does just what you need from a to-do app.,
"Simple and efficient, best to do app I've found thus far",
Only suggestion is a calander view would be nice.  Thanks!,
"Hey, it's Android not a dumb iOS, where is the black theme (must have for amoled screens) and other options? Are you for real? I'd rather give money to the Israelis than you.",
"Rather excellent app. Well thought out,  extensible and clean design.",
Best to do list app that I've found.,
This app is very helpful as it is available across multiple platforms.  I love it!!!,
Really clean and easy to use. Keeps you focused. Best todo app on the market.,
Easy to use. And I do utilize it. Almost like a task manager,
"Very easy to use.  It also transfers data to my calendar,  making it my favorite to do list!",
Makes life easy and well managed.. I recommend this app to all.,
The best app about productivity. I will be premium in no time.,
One one the better to-do apps I've ever tried,
Great app. Has helped me get organize and be more productive with time.,
"Nice, works well. I wish it looked as clean as the website though.",
"The web version is better, but it is absolutely awesome to have an app as well.",
Been looking for a to do list for a while.  This does what I need.,
My favorite task keeper outside of Inbox or Google Keep.,
Great app so far. Looking forward to learning more features.,
Works well across different platforms.,
Effective and easy management tool to ensure you keep up on tasks.,
Helps me a lot. Don't trust your brain. Download this,
Very good app. Works and up to my expectation. Thank you,
"Great interface design, useful features, integration with other apps",
This app is out of my standard and its easy and well-organized,
I use todoist! I use it everyday.  I pay for a membership. This is one of my most useful app.,
This app is exactly what I needed .... Availability on all the platforms is icing on the cake .... Nice work by todoist team.,
"Todoist is great, it easily syncs with all your other productivity apps.",
Easy to use and reference. Syncs very nicely across all my devices. An excellent app!,
Switched from rtm and am happy I did.,
A very useful application that helps me accomplish my duties every day,
"Reminders are easily set, multiple options (push notification, sms, email). Clean interface. I recommend it!",
Love this app.. Linked it to Sunrise calendar and it works like a charm,
Having Todist on my phone is proving much more useful than having it on the computer.,
Cuando tenga el pro doy la otra estrella,
I only wish the free version had more premium features.,
Just started using and it has improved my productivity.,
Best to do list I have used,
Try including check list if possible,
Good but wished you could use color more,
Great for organising the family or work life,
It helps me to organize the tasks,
I really improve my task management using Todoist,
Love using this in cojunction with the browser and gmail addons for firefox,
Keeps me up to date on what I should be doing,
Will be great and lovely if sync and reminders features will be free,
"Nice and clean interface ,better than any do and has all what wunderlist got....",
Just miss the integration in gmail on android...,
Tried every productivity app in the world.  This is by far the best,
"Simple and easy, and can sync with PC. Great!",
"Other than it trying to add tasks to 'Inbox' project all the time, works like a charm...",
So convenient!   Great  reminders.,
This is my favorite to do list app so far!,
"I have no excuse now... Not ""to do it""",
"Brilliant app, highly recommended!",
Best app for managing own tasks and tasks assigned to others. It is aslo synced over nearly all platforms..,
To do great help to do my list in a place where I can find it! :-),
The best to-do app of them all!,
Great for organizing  me and not allowing me to  forget  to do something,
"Just great, it does everything I'd want it too",
Working out good,
I have tried the others. This one is best.,
"Clean, customizable, easy, and quick. Been using it for almost a month.",
Best part is its available for all platforms and give seamless connectivity,
"Great app, so intuitive.",
"Would like greater Integration with the website version of one's tasks. Appreciate the effort, getting better. Needs to have a dark theme asap",
Very easy to use. Works nice on pc and Android phone.,
I have loved this app for a while. Worth buying.,
Just love it! Get it now.,
Amazing todo listing app ... keeps you on track,
Love this app!,
It's help me to finishing my office work,
Would like it integrated with Google Calendar though.,
Good little app helps you stay organized,
Very flexible and comprehensive productivity app.,
Love the app especially as a widget,
"Top drawer, so much customisation and works very well",
"Really amazing, I think it doesn't need anything else but an ""overview"" or ""review"" for all tasks in the week, would improve task management to the max! :)",
Perfect way for an unorgniaed person to get orgnised.,
It is one of the kind best in the market.,
Would renew premium if this feature was available,
Best one I've used so far.,
There is a chrome extension for this that makes it super useful,
I like that it syncs to my gmail,
Wish I could give it 6 stars,
"Like the interface, giving timeline to stuff, project tagging and list sharing .....really good features in free version..",
Use this constantly,
Didn't have reminder option!!! Oops you have to buy this for that option.,
Great app. Keeps me on check.,
Great app. Gets even better when used with ifttt,
Helps me a lot!,
I use it daily.,
"Does everything I want / need it to do, and more.   Love it!",
"Works great, thanks.",
Great tool for managing task between crew members!,
"Simple, user friendly interface",
Helping to keep my life together. :),
With premium it is much better,
Very easy to use.,
I need constant reminders and this app provides it,
Changes the due date of items automatically.,
Excelente herramienta!. Excelent tool.,
So far so good.,
Better than remember the milk and wunderlist,
This app makes me work harder,
Easy to use and very light,
The best to do app by far,
Great App To Keep You Organised,
Helpful app. Recommended.,
And it integrates with outlook too!,
If premium version is acquired.,
Recommend todoist for all to do needs.,
Very good integration with other apps.,
A great aid to productivity.,
Cannot login with G+ account,
Every morning I get a reminder,
"But, reminders should be free",
The sub task option is great.,
Keeps you organize,
Allows seamless integration,
The best so far,
Meets my need,
Great application simple and easy to use,

The must-have todo app.,
Lot of key features behind 22.5eur a year pay wall,
Very helpful.,
"So far its good, like it.",
Simple yet powerful.... A must have....,
"Wish I could delete a task in the app, but otherwise it does everything I need.",
Easy-to-use.,
Amazing app!,
"Best ""To do"" app out there!!",

I have to buy pro for a year to unlock reminders feature? For a year? Not a month? You even do not have a trial period or something... I'll stay with any.do,
Its OK.,
Subhamdas,
aqesome,
"I would probably use it if it could import my tasks from another task manager. It cannot, so I can't use it. In addition, it cannot login me using my Google account (""enter with Google"" option on the main screen)",
"I've tried many apps and Todoist has fit the bill best for me. It performs well, and has all the functionality I need (subtasks, filtering, offline support), especially after paying the annual fee.  Recommended for OCD GTD folks - or anyone who wants to get things done, even if you're not OCD.",
"It is exactly what I was looking for in an app to become organized. Beware there is an opportunity to upgrade to premium but you don't have to; however, you have the opportunity to try it for one month free! You will be amazed at how a simple design can be so helpful. Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself",
"This is truly my favorite app and is definitely the most frequently used on my phone. I'm an obsessive list-maker and this is perfect, there's nothing I'd change. I'm having a minor issue right now with scheduling tasks on and around daylight savings and my question was thoughtfully addressed in under 24hrs--what great customer service! Try it and you'll love it.",
"I've attempted multiple times to open this program, but each time it gets stuck at the sign-in screen, giving me a spinning wheel. Quite frustrating as I have this program on my desktop and wanted the easy portability; now, it looks like I have to find another app. LG Nexus 4.",
"As a Mac/Android user I couldn't find a viable replacement for OmniFocus until TODIST. Its great for teamwork, is multiplatform, works offline and after trying out several others it is the one I finally settled for. In fact I have opted for the paid version. The free version is also feature rich. Great app!",
"I've gone through dozens of to do apps and this one is my favorite, partly because of its ease of use. Only complaint I have though, is that you should be able to view the completed tasks.                                 Edit: I love the app, but ever since the update it seems to be giving me problems. Tasks don't seem to want to stay on the days I schedule them. I schedule something for a particular day, and it automatically moves to the next or previous day. Please fix this issue.",
"Awesome app. When I wanted to migrate of my old program into the cloud, I wasn't sure what to use, but after looking for a while and seeing what others found worked I am do glad I switched to todoist.",
"You guys could have more UX refinement. There are just too many functions occasionally up to a point when it isn't intuitive anymore. Perhaps you could focus more on frequently used functions using heat maps or other tools for UX. There are also times when some elements are sort of hard to press because of size or location. I just feel that it hinders me a little bit when using the app, unlike apps such as the Today Calendar which is beautifully designed with material elements. Also try motions and material",
"This is an awesome app, I am a subscribed to the premium option and I use it regularly for work.. I think it's good enough for professional use. The only things that I would like to see is an feature similar to the any.do app with their ""moments"", something that pops up in the morning that let's you plan the day. Also it will be nice to have a setting where I can have a default reminder, I like to have a pop up on my phone 15 mins before all my tasks are due. But having to do this for each task is tedious",
Bugs come but are quickly squashed but they do come fairly often.   One thing to look out for - if you change date on a task sometimes it seems too easy to inadvertently put it a year out.,
"Its best feature is, it is available on plenty of devices and even browser add ons. Paid service seems costly for a year, but it is good if using it for multiple devices and multiple places. I was looking for something similar since long time and picked it up after few blogs of top ten to do list apps.",
"Still evaluating free version but very tempted to go premium.  So far so very good. The list is there on my phone, on my desktop, in my outlook exchange view and there on Thunderbird.  That is flexibility which is hard to beat",
"I have used different task lists through the years and have found none that compare with this application. The presentation of views is really nice; views are available by project, due today (including past due), due in the next 7 days (past due also), and more. Adding recurring entries is not perfect, but very well done. I just love the integration of email to tasks in multiple email applications. It's great to be able to see emails that I need to act on, mixed with other tasks I need to do.",
"With any GTD system, it's deeply satisfying to set yourself goals each morning and review what you have achieved with a sense of accomplishment each evening. Fear of forgetting a to-do doesn't keep me up at night. However Todoist's  Karma points encourage me to capture the smallest of tasks to raise my points higher. The more I accumulate, the more addictive it is. I find ever more creative ways to ensure I can achieve each and every task to get those few extra Karma points. Favourite tool.",
"Love the sub-folders, and recurring tasks option (when I finally found it on my free version!) Only one suggestion for a dream product: to record the date of completed tasks. Two things I use Todist for is keeping track of the books and chapters I read, and fitness milestones. Being able to review them at a later date would be perfect. Overall, Todoist is an great app I use daily.",
"Fit for my use. It was the app I was looking to sort my tasks.good UI. A suggestion. If you could bring down the cost per year,it will be a hit app. Long press on tasks should give basic options like delete or done",
Love karma keeps me motivated.  Amazing interface. Only thing i would do is make the points system a competition. I understand i could do this on facebook but would love to see it in the app.  Secondly when i subtask routinely it put the task as a standalone task as well.  Please fix asap and you have a lifelong costumer!!,
"I love it. It's easy to use, easy to keep things organized, and the karma feature makes it kinda fun.",
"I don't need premium features, so this app works fine for me, replacing default task app on my smartphone. The labels make it easier to list project tasks and planning ahead, and the synch feature makes it the most useful.",
I think it is a good app but i don't think that i will use because i don't think that they have a way to make tasks recurring.,
"Good as a basic to do list manager. However the free version is too basic and doesn't differentiate this app from the thousand other to do list apps. The karma feature is cute, but really just a shiny button feature that I forgot about pretty soon.",
Could use some tweaking with the widget. Would be nice to see tasks on single lines rather than double tall lines.  Just can't see enough to make it useful.,
Another good tool to #GTD -  great for integration and like all good plans should have a deadline -  this might bug you though.  More an actual list of to do than a creative space to log thoughts.,
Very nice interface.  Simple and intuitive.  My only gripe is that you cannot create a hierarchy of project folders.,
Took me a while to get the hang of using it but once I did I loved it. Will probably upgrade to premium.,
"Having to pay to use reminders for a to do list is ridiculous, that's basic functionality. No point checking it out any further.",
"Good for listing and quickly jotting down tasks. Just wish it would allow for sub-list within each task/to-do. Example: task= ""grocery shopping""; sublist to allow for items to be entered and checked off.",
Excellent app. Unfortunately  seems to lack a little in the customization department.  Sorting lists alphabetically would be nice.  Paying 17 is a lot. Hence 4 stars: Satisfactory,
"Love this app. It is great for to-do list and keeping life organized. The only things I would tweak are personal preference things, so they are not really a big deal. Get this app and get stuff done.",
"Well this apps is new for me. But I can easily add all of my task. The user interface also great. I give 4 star because I still new to this apps. So I still trying to ise this apps. But overall, great apps",
"It got stuck for 10 minutes saying ""please wait"" when I tried to sign in using Google, until I gave up. Not a good first impression.",
Great program that is easy to use -  keeps track of the things one has done and those that one still needs to do.,
"I use it multiple times a day. Very easy to add and edit tasks. Nice clean interface. Love how it syncs so quickly with the online platform, the desktop client, and the Gmail app. Takes away my worries of forgetting a task.",
But I downloaded it because it came up in a search for location based reminders - but it doesn't :(,
"Free ap does everything I need it to.  Clean and effective interface. Task alarms would be nice, but not for the upgrade cost.",
Great app but was not able to set up exchange mail add so far. It would be a shame if it's not possible,
"That is, when I remember to turn it on! I wish it had a way to sound off when a task comes due. I don't always look at my texts or emails, so I miss things because I can't see or hear them when I'm busy doing something else on my computer.",
It's integration with Outlook is awesome. You can add emails directly from your inbox or sent items with due dates. Really cool!,
"Since Astrid shut down back in the days of yore, I've been searching for an app that offered what it did. Until now, that search was in vain. Thank you, Todoist, for allowing my to reschedule tasks based on completion. That is the best thing.",
"It's a great app but there seems to be a glitch with setting dates for the task. When I set it to, say, November 6th, in the app it shows up under tasks to do for the day after, so November 7th in this case. When I try and edit it, it still says November 6th",
I have tried so many organizations & to-do apps and this by far is the best. Easy to use. LOVE the easy add that stays in the notification bar. Really smart! Easy to move tadks to anothet day or folder. Nothing over complicated.  Fantastic,
I've tried a lot of to-do apps and this is by leaps and bounds the most feature rich and simple approach to task/project management on Android,
I used to keep my task in my calendar where I had by default notifications. This application is nothing more than a notepad unless you don't buy the paid version.,
"I have to say, this is the best I've seen so far. The intuitive way of navigating and managing your tasks is a great help. Still in the midst of exploration but it saves me a lot of chasing of ""what do I have to commit to next."" Just awesome.",
Good app just wish it went faster to make the schedules or whatever kcyftdjvlckfy I'm tired xD,
"Its very simple, flexible and easy to use. It really helps me organizing my tasks. i suggest it to everyone",
"Easy to use, and interactive, i enjoyed how easy this app made it for me to update, check, and work on my ongoing work. Used it mostly for personal work, as opposed to my job. Only wish it made it easy to go back to completed tasks to review them.",
"Slick and simple to use. Would love more printing options. Ability to print large scaled up version of lists for our notice board is needed.  Next step would be to create a calendar app or slick integration of calendar features into this app (with Google calendar compatability). Oh and brilliant support on the website, instantaneous response to queries.",
Use it for work and home. There are some UX flow issues but they're not a deal breaker. Would love to see a pomodoro timer built in with stats.,
"I do like using your app a lot, it help to keep things in order, but when intalling, permissoins were asked.for camepa/mic. Why does your app needs access to my camera and microphone in none of this content will be used in app?",
"Right now, thumbs up.",
I like it a lot and I don't even use it to its fullest capabilities. Pretty intuitive and easy to use. Great app!,
"Makes doing what you should do easier, helps eliminated distractions and improves productivity.",
"Distinguishing features include nested sublists, priorities, and cross-platform sync so I can use it in PC browser and on phone.",
"One if the biggest advantages I see in the paid app is to delegate tasks to other people, something I use all the time. I'd like to see in future versions multiple assignees for tasks when I want muktiple people to be reminded fir something, and any of the assignees can mark the task done.  Thanks for the app well done!",
"Todoist is the best to do list app out there. I started with OmniFocus on Mac but since switching to Android Todoist is the closest I've found to a full GTD app. I use it multiple times a day and it's always in sync between the desktop, browser and my phone.",
Wonderful app. Only thing I'd add is a day planner and integration to email and calls tasks,
"Todo list developers,                                      Your product flawlessly tell us our efficiency . We are expecting more features from u, to track our day to day goal, their completition,  and our efficiency rate , in the comming versions.",
"Could use some improved navigation (the back button usually closes the app) and possibly a calendar view, but overall great execution. I love the widget.",
"Todoist is honestly the only to-do app that works for me. Daily summary, adding tasks from the notification area, ability to file them into projects are just awesome and the new Karma system is an amazing improvement. I would only ask for ability to show tasks without a set deadline after the current ones in 7 days view.",
I have used many to do apps and I really like this one. The integration with Gmail is a huge plus for me,
"I like this app. It's a concise to do list that gives me appropriate notifications, ideas on how to better use it for efficiency, and allows me to set priority for different tasks. It's functional and effective for me.",
"The app is great. And please add lock function in new version, i don't want other using my phone can see my todo list.",
It gently forces you to pace both your short term and long term agenda in a lovely way. Heartily recommended!,
"Flawless design. Great for our company's work flow. Helps us organise what step of the process the order is on, and who's job it is to take care of it. Also great as a shopping list.",
"Great for keeping me on track, especially with recurring weekly goals that I might forget about.",
This is the best to do application that I have found. Well organized and easy to use. Web site provides some great insight and shortcuts.,
Not just for reminder s but a great project management tool.,
"absolutely the best productivity apps,  having tried all productivity apps and couldn't find anything better than todoist.  Thank you for making it available for feee",
I wish the reminder section was a little more together and easier to navigate through. I feel like it's tucked away.,
"This tool is intuitive, easy to use, but still has enough flexibility to make it your own.",
The whole app keeps me motivated to keep writing my task down and encourages me to actually do them!,
"The app itself is very, very good; but Todoist killer feature is its great desktop and mobile apps. That allows you to create complex projets - with multiple time-scheduled tasks - at the confort of your desktop, them access and manage them with the mobile app. Support is also great, and the premium plan adds a lot of stuff for power users.",
Easy UI and email briefings.  Best productivity app so far and trust me I used Any.do for 6 months,
Does everything I need to keep me on track with my tasks.  Easier to use than Nozbe and be functionality than wunderlist,
"its great ...helps you keep on track with your goals. synchronizes with email , to remind of work and even measures productivity!",
I have to buy the paid version in order to add tags (contexts) to my list items? Really?? I did it anyway because the app is exactly powerful enough for me without looking cluttered or cutesy.,
I loved the pre- Material Design overhaul.,
"The app is slick, very functional and has apps/plugins for outlook, chrome, windows, android and more.  Labels and reminders make this a good gtd solution.",
Does everything I need to get organized. Plus the multi-platform support keeps me in the loop the whole day.,
"This tool honestly enhance my productivity, it is providing me visibility & Vision to convert the all meshups in form of tasks, accompolish task on time .....and feel happy. I could set/acess my task at any where at any time.....and keep focusing me on all important things of my life. Thanks to team who build up this tool. KuDos..",
I'd really like to see a weekly/monthly planner calendar within todoist itself. I don't want to go somewhere else to see my todos' and projects' schedules. Also on a minor note I'd like to be able to categorize my labels so i can find them easier and much faster in the app and on the Web.,
Was looking for a todo list that is easy to use across multiple devices.   This does the trick.  Really like the sub- task and sub - project functionality.,
"Took very little time to get used to, super helpful",
This app let's you seamlessly manage your day to day tasks while making you feel good about completing them. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes keeping on top of odd jobs.,
"The Karma feature is great but priority features are way too basic. Needs to factor in task importance, urgency, due dates",
I use todoist every day. It's such an easy way to keep track of everything all in one place. Love it!,
I really like how clean it is. I'm enjoying it so far. Seems like a really good app. I've been really productive the list couple of days and I like seeing my karma increase.                                         ● I still really enjoy the app but my karma is usually always a day off (it has been two days off before). I'm not sure why this is.,
"I have tried them all, and this is the best to-do list app by far.",
But I wish I could get rid of the ''Getting Started'' thing without actually doing the tasks for it.,
"Any alarms that have been sent, can barely be heard. So it sort of defeats the purpose of the app.",
"this app is great , especially that you can organize the task according to your priority. It is easy to use, and it helps you organize your time. I love it!",
"This allows me to combine my Google keep tasks, Regularly schedule, and email notes all into one package. Saves me time and keeps me organized. IFTTT integration tops it all off.",
I have this for mobile Android and desktop. Neither one will open. My desktop application doesn't respond and my Android app perpetually tells me to please wait.,
"This app is very easy to use, love how you can tap to add an item from the tray on home screen. Would be even better if you could add a time of day that something needs to be done and a reminder at a specific time for it!",
"I've organised my hectic schedule with todoist, love it.",
Perfect for organizing my tasks. All you would ever need in a to-do list and nothing more!,
"I love the ease of use, tags and projects. Fits right in with getting things done!",
Like the integration to Outlook and the ability to manage tasks on many platforms.,
"Only wish they could make team box assignment for individuals, only visible to the individual",
Read about it in a web magazine review for best productivity and to do list app. I decided to try some but decided that Todoist is simply the best! You have to try it!!!,
"i loved any.do but this is waaay better! i would love to see a link with contacts (call mom, and it grabs the number info from contacts)",
"A must for all list-making needs. It has a cool labeling and keyword intelligence which makes organising your tasks a breeze. With easy integration into any online calendar and a nifty location-based reminding feature, ToDoist is an app that must be tried to be appreciated! The Free account is a great way to get started!",
"From it's o do list for today to it's Add Task from the drop down menu, this is a great an awesome program.",
"I'm using it for not so long, but i liked what i see. Its pratical  and direct. Easy to organize tasks into projects.",
Notifications should be free. Can't figure out how to set time for notifications. Free 30 day trial is nice.,
"My office is paperless, but the CRM does not support Getting Things Done methodology. Todoist stands in the gap!  Great app and well worth the annual subscription.",
Would give 5 or even 6 stars if it has Google Calendar synchronization,
"If you want to exceed in organization, productivity, and well roundness, Todoist is the catalyst that will help get you there",
"Good app but lot more could be done like providing alarms, at least for priority 1 work.",
Highly recommended for people with many things to take care of :),
It is a great way to make a note to do something when it pops into my head!,
I have tried out many task/to-do apps. This one was made especially for me! Thanks guys!,
I love how easily it let's you organize tasks and how they take the effort to encourage you to complete your tasks,
Only have free version. But I really like it so far... Don't see how to share events yet though.  Perhaps that's in upgraded version.,
Love it so far. Haven't tried some of the features yet,
I am using it for everyday tasks. Great. Better to purchase premium option. More organized.,
"I love its integration with Firefox and Gmail. And the karma stuff, nice.",
"Love it! Allowing me to keep on task while tasks are coming from projects, emails, family.  Good stuff!",
Really intuitive. Time will tell if it's worth going premium.,
App is awesome and i love the way it works for me throughout the devices but I specially loved the karma feature which is a kind of game for me to archive more on a daily and weekly basis.,
Everyday I use this and everyday I'm so glad I got premium. Works perfectly and has shaped my organisation in such a succinct way! But really looking forward to todoist with androidwear!,
It crashed when I trying to login with google account,
Love being able to breakdown tasks. Very easy & intuitive to use.,
"Inspires and motivates me because of its clean interface, elegant branding, and many features.",
Still working it out but very happy so far.,
This app is great. I use it to organize my life and it is really easy to use. Highly recommended.,
It's hard not to be organised if you commit to this.,
"This app is snappy! What you need to know is that it offers very easy organization of nested task and projects, even for free users. The priceless feature is the very clean and comfortable 7 day view (not week view) , which I haven't found in any other platform. Synchronization between Web and app is seamless and bug free so far. I don't need the paid features but considering to pay anyway because it's such a nice app!",
"Using it on android tablet, iPhone and mac. Works and syncs flawlessly on all three.",
"Simply, it has everthing I dreamed of for this kind of app.",
"I've used many apps to implement GTD, but this is my favorite! I use it on many platforms, and it is consistently good on all of them. The premium version is reasonably priced too!",
I love the flexibility and the karma points motivate me to get things done.,
When you choose due date for a task it is listed as on the following day in the task list.  Problem since last update maybe?,
If it can organise my lack of organisation it will work for anyone,
"Makes keeping productive easy, practical and even fun.  I love it!",
"Great to do list maker and reminders, I just need to get to-doing!",
"It took me almost 5 minutes to login the first time, doesn't keep tasks after we complete, ask for stupid permissions to setup (location, identity????), oh well, I kept the app for 10 minutes on my phone...",
Awesome app! It keeps everything I need regardless of what it is and let's me edit constantly,
"Great app, needs android wear support though!",
I now have everything I need to do logged and organised. Thanks,
"Tracey's right, it is good! and easily justifies the £17.99 a year charge. You get access to the todoist app for Windows, Mac, IOS, Android and Thunderbird on Linux and a host of application integrations which all sync from your account.  Definatly an app for productivity and I've never experianced issues using it over the last year.  The UI is wel balanced and functional, the features are all useful and this is an essential part of my work flow.  At $1.5 per month utilising this app pays for itself in the first week by keeping me on track.",
Such a beautifully designed and implemented application - works intuitively and naturally.,
The only To Do app I've been consistent about using.Premium is worth the price!,
Why did u set reminder as a premium feature? It should have been a basic feature in every to-do app imo..,
Works great and helps me stay organized. Premium service is a great buy.,
That's it realy no idea  if it's any good...just hangs on sign up    edit.. Sorted... Up the grade but still would like to synch with Google tasks...,
I just hope for Google calendar support.,
Really useful app. I love lists and this is ideal!,
Could have some features like Any. Do,
Straight forward app. Very usefull. Particuly like the ability to view completed tasks.,
Finally a task manager that does everything I need it to. Well done!,
It really help me on really busy schedulle,
It's so good and easy but I prefer if it for free,
It's been a pleasure using this app and the associated service. 5 stars,
Simple and easy to use. The reminders are helpful too.,
Good one. It will help if there are reminder alarms.,
Great app and love the feature you can sync with pc version.,
Good app that syncs with he computer soon as I log in.,
"very simple and well organized, help task and time management super easy",
Good for a lazy person,
I remember stuff now. Lol,
"Oustanding, not just a single barrel rask application, the whole deal, and other applications integration... .",
By far the best task app I've used.,
Pls I'll rate 5 stars,
I am a college student and it helps me keep on track,
Keeps me so organized,
I have found this app easy to use and very helpful!,
Sends best reminders of your daily tasks,
The widget is well worth having on your homescreen,
Its simple and quite effective the way you want an app to be to manage your tasks,
It has helped me with reminds about my sisters Doc app I help take care of her,
Haven't used it mutch but seems good,
Simply love it. Highly recommended if you want to do tasks and increase your productivity.,
I love it specially because of its integration with Sunrise calendar,
Simple to use and syncs with all my devices,
I got the paid app. to get the notes and https. Fabulous. Keep up the good work.,
"Great tool, no need for pen & paper reminders",
Very cool and user-friendly app. Also still very pleased karma levels - it's a great motivation to use ToDoist. :) Thank you. Life is RPG ^^,
"Practical, functional & friendly!",
Otherwise interesting,
I would have given it the 5 stars but reminders should be part of the free version,
Very simple and easy to create and check finished tasks.,
Can't leave without it,
"Simple interface, easy to use, does all it's supposed to",
What I've been looking for for a long time,
Gmail integration is excellent. Very useful app.,
Would be cool to get reminders in free version,
Easy to use and able to customize to my needs.,
I like it better than 2do for android.,
One of the best todos out there!,
Really helpful in keeping me organized and accountable,
"Very simple , easy way to stay organized",
the projects are a helpful feature. switched over from any.do,
Helped me to stay in track everyday,
I love this app.,
Excelente complement to my calendar.,
Hope there's update to use with android wear...,
Needs mac integration then 5 *,
Nice App. Makes me more productive.,
I like it,
Simple app with good features..,
Great app so far.,
It is defenitely keeping me more organized.,
"Good, but hard to make categories.",
Simple that's what I like in my life,
estou aqui pelo programa LOOPINFINITO,
Thinking of getting premium one,
"Love it, 4 me best to do manager",
Todo list done right.,
Very nice app on task management,
Best to do app ever,
But £17.99 a year!  I don't think so.,
"Easy to use, not too many bells and whistles....has a job to do and does it.",
Simple task scheduler,
Does what its designed to do.,
I like the app,
Easy to use and to the point,
My best todo app,
"Useful, BUT it costs $29/year to use simple options like alert/task notification? Wow,  no.",
"its a great app, an organizer for a busy me..",
The App on the go. Thumbs up!,
Simples e direto.,
Mature work and stable app,
Thus far (a few days) it does what I need it 'to do'!,
"Simple, accurate, quick, helpful!",
Made me 10K% more productive.,
Great stuff.  Very impressive.,
I like it. Especially synchronization with browser plugin.,
Wouldn't let me create an account,
"Easy, quick, with Outlook integration",
I like it so far.,
Very good....premium one is very expensive...,
Thank you for this app.,
Good but long way ahead....,
The more u use it the more u love it,
Great service!,
Very handy!,

Ifttt integration ftw!,
Love the widget :),
"Es excelente,",
Why do i have to log in with any of my accounts to a todo app for my everyday schedule. Uninstalled after installation.,
Simple Yet Efficient,
A good organizer,
Nice app,
Simple and frequently updated,
Good for now,
So far great,

"Lots of free apps have some of the functionality that you have to pay for on this app. But this app is so much, much better than them - we're using it across PC, mac, Android and iPhone, working collaboratively, and I'm organising all my personal stuff with it as well, and all for a few pence per day. The people moaning about having to pay clearly don't need an app like this, but if you need something powerful, flexible and very well designed then this is for you.",
Man I love this app. My only problem is that it is still missing the Karma feature. Then it would be PERFECT!  EDIT: NOW IT HAS KARMA AND IT IS THE PERFECT APP. LITERALLY. I HOPED FOR THIS DAY FOR SO LONG.,
"Being a freelancer,having todoist has helped me a lot. Collaborating with clients has never been so easy.",
I find new ways to use this on an almost daily basis. Loving the new karma set up,
"A simple but highly effective way to keep track of everything you need to do, get, and remember.",
"Great integration with Chrome, online and android.  I like the daily reminder emails too.",
"Been searching for a to do list app for a long time, and this finally wins!  I love the cross platform availability ...it is always right there whether I'm  working in Chrome, Outlook or on my phone or tablet remotely.",
Pretty good and useful app.  I used any.do but it worked incorrectly on my tablet. This app has a lot more tools,
"Installed this app on mobile and tablet... pleased to see they sync. Installed Ever note at same time, but deleted it as To do list suits me better.",
Uninstalled immediately. Google Calendar works across all my devices. And it will send a million notifications for free.,
We have to pay for your notification feature? Even Android's own notification there is none. What a dealbreaker. Every other task app has it.,
Also works with Google apps,
"Clean design,  very useful.",
Good only if u go for paid version,
Great tasking app.  Thanks,
Easy to use. Simple format.,
Only shortcoming is lack of IFTTT integration.,
It simply works and works well,
Perfect balance of functionality and minimalism,
It reaching all requirements,
Excellent to do app,
Good app,
!!!!!!,
"I've been waiting for an easy and concise application to manage tasks for ages. This hits the spot. Repeatable tasks, one time tasks, reminders; it's keeping me on track. Along with the desktop application I can always be productive. The best part is the widget. Its fully functional even if the app isn't open!",
"Update Oct 09,2014 : An awesome app just got even better with the Karma addition - congrats Todoist team! P. S. A sorting tasks feature like in web/pc apps would be quite handy too :-)",
"I still favor NOZBE if for one feature only and that's the ability to forward a task from any email. I use multiple emails and I need to sometimes set up a task based on an email I recieve. If I receive it using the email I set up the account with no problem but if the task I am setting up comes from another email then it won't do it. This is where NOZBE really takes the lead. I haven't used all the features yet and I am also wondering about connections to Evernote, Box etc..",
"NO.  Download it and get hit with charges at EVERY junction.  Want this feature PAY.  Want that feature PAY.  This is the kind of cheap bullshit app company who start with okay how can we suck people into an app and then extol money from them, I know a todo list app, right get to work.  Do not I repeat get this app.",
"I've tried various ""to-do list"" apps, and I haven't found one I really liked since Astrid was bought out. I've only been using this app for a few days (the free version), and I believe it's already helped to streamline my workflow and keep me appraised of what I need to do to reach my goals. The developer offers a trial for the paid version; I've taken advantage of this, and I may invest in it.",
The app has mostly every thing you'll need and supports Multiple platforms and browser extensions so you can sync everything among your personal devices...The Homescreen widget proves to be very useful...Premium users have access to reminders and Notes...Todoist is highly recommendable to every one...Thanks for the great app...,
Smallest is 4x3. I want to know what I need to do in my life not have my tasks be the main focus of my life.,
"I've been happy with it so far. The only problem is that when you want to delete recurring events after a certain date, it does not work.",
"...with the free version. Design is clean, tasks are easy to organize, and the app is very flexible itself. Recommended to anyone who loves simplicity and productivity all in one app.",
This app is literally the best to-do list invention to be created! Absolutely love everything about it. It is missing nothing although an extra feature such as colour-schemes would be a bonus.,
"Simple, pretty quick, easy to set date & priority. Free version has no reminders except daily reminder/ email.",
Very handy. Love it too bad I don't have a credit card to enjoy its full features :-),
Even the free version is very helpful.  Much better than Wunderlist which I used previously.,
I first time install it on computer and I fall in love with it so I install it on my smartphone,
One of my top 2 favorite list apps on the Play Store. Very organized and awesome customizability features!,
Kids will respond much better to a push notification than a chore request!,
"Simple, clean, and the natural language due dates are great.",
Great for starting your life up again..,
Great app. It change my life,
It's a great app to help  manage our task.,
Great app to help organize your life.,
Perfect to help me keep track of daily task progress.,
I would like to have more options. It is a little limited.,
Todoist helps me keep my thoughts organized and helps me plan my moves.,
Helps keep me on too of my to do lists,
Alway keeps you updated by sending you notice on email,
Great app that keeps me productive.!,
Its working for me.,
Small item. But very useful work,
Missed lots of deadlines.,
Todoist keeps me accountable for my productivity.,
Great application. Loving it all the way,
Easy to use and it works perfectly.,
Very much space taking app,
Muy buena herramienta para organizar tu día a dia,
Really effective....I love it,
Works great!,
Great overall tool,
Loved it very much,
It is very useful,
Awesome,
Great,
Epic,

"The older I get the more help I need to remember what I supposed to do. I was never very good at staying focused on what I was supposed to do. Problem solved.  I keep finding more ways to use it almost daily. I linked it to my Outlook and use it instead of the Task feature. Does it have it's unique way of doing things sometimes, yes but so do most programs. I now have a to do list that is up to date all the time with on 5 devices",
"Best thing I like is that these guys hav a chrome and firefox addon. I add most of my tasks on laptop, and it automatically syncs to my phone. Pretty good options for ordering, categorizing and searching tasks.This app really helped me improve my efficiency at managing my tasks. Only two things I miss is the ability to add reminders and to view completed tasks. But I cant complain 'cause they have those in the paid version.",
"It is fairly easy to set up, there are nice looking premium features i have not tried yet, but the app seems very usable as is which I greatly appreciate. It also says it is usable across platforms which i will try soon, that is an important feature for me. Thank you for your work",
"I have tried the best out there. Any. DO, wunderlist you name it. But nothing provided me the simplicity ToDoist provided. You can get done a lot even in the free version. In fact, ToDoist people were kind enough to offer me a premium membership for free for a month.",
"Todist is a great app for me. I tend to have a lot of different projects going on and was forgetting to do a lot of things. This is great for keeping track of what needs to be done. I love the sub projects and tasks, the recurring scheduling, and the ability to share a list with others. And you get a lot of projects and list items for free. Nozbe limits you to only five.",
"This app is on all my devices and browsers.  Well designed and really useful feature set.  On mobile there's an integration with cloudmagic which comes in handy to add email tasks, but even with another email app you add tasks by emailing to specific projects.  I also use Sunrise so everyday i get a birds eye view of things I need to get done in addition to my meetings.",
"Had not found a good to do list since I left my Palm OS devices.  Todoist is so much better. I wish some of the date features were form based, checking off for every week for repeated events but perhaps I will end up seeing the advantages of this  new style.",
"I have only been using it a few weeks, but so far, I believe this is the task master I have been seeking. I almost didn't try it because of wasted time on other diappointing productivity apps. A colleague gave me a push and glad she did. I will soon be trying the additional available features. I am especially excited about the ability to assign tasks to my assistant within the app.",
"Love the widget and the ""add another..."" button for quickly adding a bunch of tasks. There is one bug with the widget... When you tap to switch lists and choose one from the pop-up, your most recently opened app quickly opens and closes again. It's really annoying in what would otherwise be a perfectly polished app.",
"Took me some time to decide between Todoist and one of the competitors.  The clean interface, the support of multiple platforms and the fact that the app is so easy to use, made me choose Todoist.  Will revisit for five star once I am able to explore to full potential.",
"Very intuitive and feature-rich app that benefits from Sunrise Calendar support, but hampered by its payment structure. A subscription model seems steep for a to do list app, where a traditional buy-to-use model would be more appropriate. If you're willing to pay the subscription then you get access to many very useful features indeed. Otherwise you're better off with Wunderlist.",
subject says it all but overall a solid product. Am considering the £ version since the added functionaility of inc. attachments and notes would lend itself to easy project management. There are other software pieces that offer these features for free but this thing is slick and quick as hell to use.,
"An app that offers even essential features like reminders only in paid/premium version is a strict no-no. Besides this setting recurring meetings is a pain.  To answer the developer's question: Reminder is a basic feature that was available even in my basic phone of 90s and hence making that available only on paid/premium version is not justifiable. It's not about the price, but what you are paying for.",
"Very good overview, intuitive interface with collapsible projects, all makes sense. Misses the total task preview. On the website, I love being able to see how many tasks are already scheduled for a future day so I can avoid overscheduling when postponing tasks. STILL, for a free app and service I can't complain. So much better than Wunderlist!",
"Don't pay them any money, you will regret it. Sync across devices is out of order. Your projects and tags get deleted or changed without warning. Mobile app, Outlook plug in and Windows apps are horrendously out of sync... And the developers know it and still don't /can't fix it. I regret applying for a subscription, don't make the same mistake.",
"Good little app that's helping to make me more organised, hopefully. Have tried and failed with others but this one seems to have everything I need except maybe a calendar for longer term stuff. A minor detail though and loving it so far",
"While this app, may be comprehensive, it is very confusing to use. I upgraded to the annual plan and I'm having second thoughts on continuing to try to use it and figure it out. I've searched the program and the Internet for instructions as to how to use it, to no avail. All I can find are adds and videos talking about how darn good it is. They should spend some of that money they are raking in helping those who already paid them to figure out how to actually use the app and how to use it across platforms.",
"Originally I gave this a 1-star review because it kept showing completed tasks. I am happy to say that the problem has been fixed for quite a while. I use the widget and like how you can quickly reschedule a task to Tomorrow, Next Week, etc. I use this every day and am pretty sure that if I didn't use it I'd end up forgetting to do things I needed to do!",
"I am really bad with diaries resulting in scraps of paper with indefinable notes left everywhere.  Did not get on well with the diary apps on my phone either.  Until Todoist came along.  So quick and easy to use, reliable, and no long list of instructions.   Great for shopping lists too!",
At first when I downloaded todoist I really didn't use it much. It had kinda weird system which I wasn't used to working with. But after a while I gave it a shot and found out the possibilities. I like the clean and easy to read UI. Widget for android is great as I use it all the time during the day. Project folders and tags are awesome for sorting. The only thing I really miss is some more visible highlighting of the folders instead of just a dot next to the name and custom colours too.,
"Closest match for my needs yet. Integration across multiple platforms, great calendar integration and flexibility of Todoist's UI (dragging tasks from project to project is a breeze) are among the best features. Affordability is reason enough to migrate yet again; lack of basic functionality such as notes and reminders are big blows to the free version. Though that isn't to discourage those who can from making the most of an otherwise fantastic app.",
"I come from an iOS environment. I used Omnifocus with my iPhone and Mac. It is one of the best GTDs out there. When I switched to Android, I looked for an alternative. I tried all the free ones. Wunderlist, the Squid thing, Google tasks, etc. Nothing was so fluent and fast as todoist. The design is great. I love adding tasks via the task bar or hitting a combination of my computers and add a task. Reminders are great and everything seems to work. What I miss, but are not really necessary would be location r",
"Easy to organize, schedule, set reminders, tag, break into sub-tasks, and share among people. WISHLIST: * Add support for Task/Comment revision history (in case of accidental overwrite) while keeping it simple. * Add support for richer markup (to support well-elaborated text) like Markdown while keeping it simple.",
"So far, Todoist has worked wonders for my agenda. I tried a few competitors, but Todoist does things none of them can, like inserting clickable links directly into task items or creating multiple levels of nested tasks with due dates, notes and attachments for any item. There isn't unnecessary ornamentation or animation to slow things down. Task creation and editing is very fluid. My only complaint is that the Chrome extension has been buggy so far. Still, it's well worth a paid subscription IMO.",
"I needed an app that would allow recurring tasks and cross multiple platforms: pc, mac, and android. This has certainly done that. I know I am under utilizing it, but I haven't taken the time to really explore. It's that easy to set up.",
Applause for following the Android design guidelines so well. It's a beautiful looking app. The widget is the most functional of any app on existence. My only wish would be  making subtasks easier or more straightforward. Alternatively if you could just check off notes and assign them dates that could work too...,
"I love the 'real language' date entry format.  Super easy to be able to put ""Every third Monday at 1300"" and have it just do it. Only thing I could see as an improvement is to have the choice to add an on screen popup in addition to a Notification Tray reminder.",
"A good, basic to do app. But what drives me mad is setting a reminder: you are meant to write it as you would say it, so 'tomorrow 5pm'. But no matter what time I try and put it sets it to 10:00am. Aaargh!",
"This is a great app. It's a pitty it lacks tasks' time estimation feature, which is a crucial one, in my view. That is the reason I finally chose ""Remember the milk"", instead. Otherwise I would have surely chosen this one, as it is very usefull and comfortable.",
"Finally something I can use with minimal effort on my part that makes me more productive. The simple fact that it integrates with Outlook makes this phenomenal, add to the fact it works on nearly every device / platform and it becomes an actual functioning To Do app that allows you to be more productive and efficient without having to make more work to actually use it, if you know what I mean.   It's not perfect there are some tweaks, from an UI perspective, that could really enhance it's usability.   This is also the first productivity type app that I've ever spent money on. I purchased the premium services and have members of my team using it as well. I don't like the subscription model. I was also surprised since it was a subscription model that it was $30. I think that's overpriced from a consumer standpoint and is a deal breaker for a lot users. I know several of my team members wont' buy for that reason. I recommend you redo your roadmap and come done it the cost.   I can't recommend it enough.",
"I've been using the free version for less than a week, but am enjoying it greatly.  I've read several reviews and I'm not seeing any issues with notifications...I get a daily digest email; and a notification on my phone and kindle to open todoist to see my tasks.  I've had no issues with synching across devices or recurring tasks.  So far, so good.  And I have tried too many productivity apps, so still using one after a week is good for me...I know within the first day or two if I like it.",
"Todoist's snappy response time means you don't tire of using it, its sharing facilities mean you can cooperate easily, its nested project structure makes it easy to add both projects and tasks at any level of detail you want. Its interface for adding tasks could be a little smoother but it's my favorite task list app, after I've tried Avocado, Wunderlist, Evernote, Toodledo and IQTell.",
"For the most part this app is well done, so if you are just beginning with a tasking program go for it. But for the other 99.9% of the world who already use an existing tasking app and want to change over, the fact you can't import or export tasks without having to create a txt file and script puts this in the useless software pile.  The developers have been promising this feature for a couple of years now, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.",
This is an awesome app! i can put all the emails that I get into a very fast breakdown and put it according to the date I need to read it next.  The only thing I wish it would do is to be able to open up into a bigger screen so it would be easier to see all of my tasks in one place without scrolling,
"Great ToDo list manager.   Works across multiple platforms, has all the relevant capability.   Has proven to ""just work"".   I've tried many, but so far this is the best.   Just the right balance between streamlined interface, simple but yet enough functionality to even cover more robust needs.   There's always going to be a miss here and there - some of the ways to organize sub-tasks is a little awkward, for example - but for the most part this app gets it right.   Well done!",
"I've tried lots of To Do action lists, and I already use GTD (getting things done) on paper.  ToDoist puts the focus on getting things completed. The interface is clear and obvious, without being quirky. The professional version links my ToDo list with 13 platforms (I mostly use the web interface on my laptop but I could install the Windows software).  Sure there are things it could do in the future, and tech support is responsive and helpful",
"Previously used Any.Do and I thought that was great,  but ToDoIst  is just phenomenal. The level of detail that can be assigned to Tasks ranges from Simple to Complex and exceeds my expectations.  The Attach File works a treat (didn't work in Any.Do) and Support is unbelievably speedy and effective (Any.Do never answered my emails). There are so many features and the Integration with Outlook       includes Email and SMS reminders   and a host of other features. Highly recommended.",
"After Astrid went down, I have never been satisfied with any To Do app. I tried almost all services. Any.DO wasn't for power users. Todoist looked promising, but it doesn't provide notification feature to free users. So, I was using Wunderlist. Today, I decided to subscribe Todoist premium. It's great, but still I miss Astrid (that was really great gold standard).",
"No amount of minimalistic, fluid design will make up for the lack of FUNDAMENTAL features sorely missing from the free version of this app. Let me explain: Labels, Reminders, Notes, Custom Filters, Attachments ALL RESTRICTED unless you pay a $29 annual fee. I don't see how many could justify this purchase when there's other equally efficient apps that accomplish the exact same thing & more without the need to upgrade. I'm sorry, Todoist, I like you but adjusted pricing or added features are needed here :(",
"I really, really love this app in terms of the UI, usability, easy to learn, etc, but I refuse to pay $29 for such basic features as reminders and notifications. I would willingly pay a one time fee to purchase a full version of the app, but not $29. And that's an annual fee, not a lifetime one. Super duper lame.",
"Really great productivity / task management app. Would love some more features around editing all aspects of multiple items in one go (assigning priorities, contexts etc), and viewing (e.g. ordering tasks by priority, due date, label, etc., within any view). Would also like the experience to be a bit more consistent across platforms. . Certainly my favourite task app that I've used (at the moment...) Unlike other short sighted users, I'm happy to pay a subscription for an ongoing service to ensure the providers of the service stay in business and keep me productive. $30 is right at the top end of what I'd pay. By comparison Evernote is about $50 and Office 365 (which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint etc, and 1TB of storage) is about $100.",
"After checking the app was great on all platforms I use (it is!), subscribing to premium was a no brainer. A great balance between powerful features and simplicity. Recurring tasks is the only feature I feel is missing.",
"I was hesitant to pay for a task app and held off for a while, but once I purchased an iPad I needed something to sync across platforms. After reading reviews it was apparent Todoist was my best choice, and after using it for a couple weeks I agree. Really well done!",
"This app has helped me more than any other ""todo"" app I've tried... and that includes dozens of others. I love the emails to tell me the days tasks and the graphs that help me monitor my progress and increase my productivity.",
"This app has dramatically changed my workflow for the better. I find it easier to hold myself and others accountable because nothing gets missed. Much easier to manage tasks here than through outlook. The ability to share projects is a bonus, and something my team is finding useful.",
"Added a few month later.  My appreciation continues grow for Todoist.  Different ways to use ""labels"" and nesting project (notebooks).  I also like the clear color coding. The recurring dates work but are the chief area I'd like improved.——Older review follows   Unlike Wunderlist: Todoist's search feature is present and works on my Android Tablet. Todoist has much more sophisticated, useful reoccurring tasks functions.  Like Wunderlist it features: I like have a button to call it up in my browser (Chrome) I works on my IMac. Caveat, Todoist has only been on my devices for a few days.  So far so excellent. I am using the premium service.  Added -- I'd like Todoist to have a reoccurring task control of ""next"" as in ""next monday, wednesday"" also be good to have an end function for reoccurring tasks.  The note function works but first you have to save the task then find it on the task list and note there—clunky  Added: Bottom Line Try Todoist, Wunderlist, and Trello  — Todoist is still my choice for day to day list making,.even with the newest release of Wunderlist.",
"One of the many way to keep a to do list. This one is best for personal projects and to-do. I love how it's organized and how well it integrates with Sunrise calendar which is by far one of the best calendar UI right now. Improvements would be to integrate more voice functions and prompts when inputting which will make its mobile function easier. Also social integration, something like Facebook, with a social thread should be considered with a news feed to motivate us in completing a shared project or plan.",
I just found out that there really is no in-app notification feature for this app. What then is the point of this.,
Can't provide fifth star until desperately needed Google calendar integration finally arrives. Using Sunrise cal as an intermediate step should not be necessary.  Otherwise awesome.,
I like the layout but i wish they would let you changed more to your 'To Do's' options,
"Totally love this app. Though it requires some improvements here and there,  overall it's a very good app. It properly balances the functionality and look to provide a nice user experience.",
Use it at work in Mozilla Thunderbird as an add-on but then can set reminders for next day on my phone of things which I've forgotten to do or phone calls I take out of the office. Great tool.,
"To Do List - Simple elegant, brings order to my life. Syncs on my PC, my Samsung tablet and my iPad. Essy and nice No learning curve at all",
"Using Google Now just say ""add note Get gas soon"" & set to save to Todoist - super easy way to save quick notes w/o fumbling with your phone.  A little expensive but worth it because it ""just works""",
"This app is great for someone like me who needs separate lists for all parts of my life! It's easy to add items, navigate between lists, and check things off or add them quickly. I also like the fact that on my Android device, I can have widgets with some of my larger/high priority list. The sharing feature is nice too, because you can share specific lists, without sharing them all, and anyone can edit them. This has made grocery shopping and bill paying with my fiance easier with our busy schedules!",
I cant live without it. It help me to manage a huge tasks in my work days and make them finished,
"This app really helps keep me on track throughout the week, and because I put it on all my devices (phone, tablet, laptop) I have it with me wherever I go. The emails are a little unnecessary, but I don't really mind.",
Almost perfect. I think it would be better if there was a widget for the todo list. I also think it would look nicer if the colors for the labels were a little larger.,
Only to do list app I've ever been able to use for a prolonged period now I don't go without it,
"Replaced Wunderlist with Todoist, and couldn't be happier. Could only be better if the app actually completed the tasks for me.",
So far the app has lived up to most of it's promises. I love the flexibility and features. I wish it was a one time buy instead of a subscription.,
"No matter the ecosystem, this app provides an excellent solution that helps you get things done.",
I love the ability to use location based reminders with my GTD. Also great cross platform application.,
Used my google+ account to spam my email with lots reminder and reminders to remind me about reminding myself to add more to do items so I can be reminded. Also would appreciate a location option.,
"It does what is expected. Works great on my mac and nexus devices. Just add recurring tasks feature, and it will become the perfect task management app.",
"To withhold fundamental features like reminders or tags (filters) for the express purpose of regularly charging users subscription money is offensive. Uninstalled. Consider charging a one time fee for the app, you vampires.",
"One of the best todo list ever tried. Keeps you organized and let's you be in sync with your team, friends and family",
"The app has a glaring bug: the calculation for daily repeating tasks breaks if you mark a daily task as complete after midnight. Instead of calculating one day from when the task is due, it calculates from when the task is marked done making the next due date tomorrow thus skipping today -- even though this is a daily task. This is a bug the developers know about and refuse to fix.  The location feature, like a few other features in this app, is incomplete.  It neither allows for the use of common locations (Home, Work, etc.), it also doesn't use Google's own starred locations. So, every time I want a reminder for when I arrive home, I have to enter the complete address (which autofills incorrectly).  Which renders this high-touted feature completely useless in practice. The app should either allow the selection of oft-used addresses from a list or use Google-starred addresses.",
The free version was good enough. I bought the premium membership just because the app is too good. Worth every rupee spent. It can't get better than this.  Please get something like this for personal finance management.,
I just started using the app and haven't gone through how it works but seems like there are lots of functions.,
"Right up there with the best. Some basic features held ransom by recurring annual price tag is a bit much though. Even as a one-off, over $20 is palatable, but every year? No. Would be 3.5 stars based on this, if I could give half stars. With a friendlier price/feature balance, would be easily 5 stars.",
My level of productivity has sky rocketed since I downloaded this app. Very helpful for anyone looking for an innovative task manager.,
"I love todoist! Allows me to manage my tasks including crucial recurring financial bill payment reminders across all my devices including android phone, ipad and pc. Couldn't live without it.",
"This app has the most intuitive interface in the genre of ""getting things done"".  The free version is sufficient to get to learn the app, and the paid version is a logical next upgrade path.",
After having tried many to do apps I ha e found this to be flexible and not overwhelming.  Good integration with other apps and chrome.,
I find this better than any.do so I'm sticking with it. I might even get the premium version which is very cheap.,
"This is the best to do app I have ever came across with. I used to enjoy any.do but since the day I switched to todoist ,there was no looking back. Now my life is more managed with such a great app.",
"More aggressive reminders, that kind of thing. A good to-do app should be like a slap in the face, not like a notebook that you can just chuck under the bed and forget about forever",
Sad that you have to pay for reminders. Other than that it's the best task manager I've worked with,
Enjoy having on all my platfirms however I feel inundated by how the items are stacked. I feel overwhelmed. There has to be a better interface.,
"I used it all. Astrid, Wunderlist, Any.do, RTM, Google Keep and many more. For me, only todoist seems to got it right. It's 4 stars only because the web interface has a couple of minor bugs.",
"I was using Google trello for my gtd system, and todoist simply has a much better interface and adaptability for my needs.",
"Free app itself has features that help a lot. Best part is that it can be synced between mobile, laptop , outlook, and also can be viewed in browser",
Never any problems. Love having multiple levels of sub tasks and being able to categorise by colour among other things,
Loved the app. It's convenient and great to use. Would update to premium in a while. Found it better than any.do and wunderlist and has a better user interface.,
"If I need to remember to do something, it goes on my todoist list. Otherwise it gets forgotten. Wish there was a quicker way to mark tasks complete on the mobile app but still love it",
"Hey do you wanna add a description to your note? Well too bad you didn't pay us 30$! Want a reminder? Nooo too hard, gotta have my 30$! So I actually downloaded a couple of notetaking apps just to try them out and this one is by far one of the most annoying ones. I mean there are apps that have all this basic functionality and are free (psst Ticktick) including lists, alerts, location alerts, file attachments and sync.",
"I organize my work, school and personal life. Well worth upgrading to pro",
"A slick app for keeping track of what I need to do. The nesting is good for checklists, the natural time is intuitive. Just wish it did offline better though.",
"This is such a great and simple app. All it needs is a simple calendar view! No times like other calendars, just tasks to keep it really simple.",
"Works well on my nexus 5. It has help me take control of my schedule. Intuitive interface, good reminders.",
"Does what it needs to do and syncs across both my computers (1 Mac, 1 PC) and my phone.",
"Pretty n user-friendly interface, supporting all operation systems, definitely the best.",
"Any note-taking app can be a ""ToDo List."" I expect a dedicated ToDo List app to have awesome reminder functions, but the ones in this app suck. The date/time options for reminders don't even have a date selector, or a time selector, or repeat options. You have to type in the reminder, like ""every 1st Monday @ 1300"". Although it has a vibrate option for alarms, it details to being turned off. And there is no pop-up for reminders. Worthless app.",
"Finelly I find perfect to-do lists! Simple, but enouth options. Not annoying. No sharing with people I dont know. No ads. Its all what I was need, and finelly I have app really useful",
Good organization and options with projects and sub-projects.  Unfortunate that reminders are premium aubscription and calender soesnt populate google calenders,
"Todoist is a great, handy todo-app with a beautiful minimal design. And a big plus is that it's available on almost any operating system.",
"To do team , app is great but after update this version this app is not running in my phone:(",
"Nothing in life is 100% perfect but this is as close as a todo app gets. The sharing is wonderful, really excellent.",
Great app would be much better if paying wasn't necessary for linking to calender.,
"I think that's OK to have two different sets of features for free and premium accounts, but it is unacceptable to remove a feature that already existed in the free version. I'm very disappointed.",
I have tried about a dozen todo apps and this one fits my workflow the best. Quick and easy task creation and management. Reliable syncing between devices. Doesn't get in my way but accessible when I need it. I can focus on the tasks rather than how to add or manage them on my list. Hands down best of all that I've tried.,
Its good but all the necessary features are in the premium version. And creating subtasks is such a chore.,
"Easy to use, gets the job done and is not intrusive. Great app. Might need some rethinking on date / time selection.",
Awesome app. But the fact that you are not allowed to set a reminder in the free version is comical to say the least. Especially when fully featured competitors are available for free.,
"Best to do app I have tried.  Had a great clean look, sync perfectly, easy navigation into setup.",
It combines simplicity for someone who wants to be a little more organised with a plethora if features for the more advanced users. Great app.,
"As someone with poor short term memory this is a great app, will upgrade very soon. Helping me to be productive. A+",
"After some improvements such as assignee permissions and label indenting, todoist is certainly the best app for task management..",
Has helped me alot. I wish It had more theme options.,
I really like it but I haven't been able to successfully sync my to do list to the cloud and PC. That is probably because I am using the free version.,
"Awesome app. Only complaint is that the list of completed tasks shows only by category, not by day. That seems really strange to me.",
"Well laid out, simple enough to pop in and out of, with enough features to help you control your tasks. It needs an auto sort option and some more theming options",
Does exactly what it should. Sync seamlessly with web version. Nice widgets and can even reside in the year for quick add.,
"This is among the best in its category. I've been using it for months and I think I've been very productive at the same time. However, I think basic reminders should be free.",
Todoist is a great productivity enhancement app and tool. We used it to monitor our team's projects and daily tasks. It makes it easy for remote monitoring - an urgent need for businesses to grow,
This app is so simple and that is where I believe its efficiency comes from. It allows you to organize your tasks in a fairly straightforward way and with its elegant interface makes this a must have app. I love the connectivity with my email and my browser. The functionality is one of the best that I have come across. I highly recommend it.,
"I started using it in disbelief, its simple and full of surprises.",
"One of the few ToDo apps available on Android to make use of location-based reminders. Nearly every app on iOS features location-based reminders. Glad to see this Dev noticed the importance, and added this feature. *It would be nice if you could change alert parameters for location reminders. Please add this to your next update.",
"great work, you can use this app through different platforms like mozilla, gmail.  thats why it makes this number 1.",
"I've been Using the app for a couple of days new and I'm very impressed with all the apps that Todoist integrates with. Email, Calendar have been the best, and the experience has been good after the learning curve.",
Great for projects as well as for a personal to-do list.  The free version is sufficient for most people.,
"This app is definitely useful for those looking for a To-Do app. Very simple and organized layout. The 'completed' animation is also very rewarding and inspirational. I wish there were more options for the free version, but we really get what we need. Might upgrade to premium.",
Todoist is a life saver! I have started and stopped using a dozen todo apps over the years. Todoist is the only one I have stuck with because it provides just enough structure and it works so well on every platform.,
I love everything. Except the subscription idea. Not going to happen. I would pay 6 bucks for extra features just to support this app but as far as subscriptions go the competition is a 49 cent notebook and a 10 cent pen once a year. But everything else I love.,
Persistant. Intelligent. Flexible and very easy to use. I really liked any.do but To do is is better all around.,
Your app help me organize my thought.  Most of the time I just relied on my memories because I am just too lazy to take note.  Now I change my mind and must admit that it really helps to take notes.  I love it.  Thank you developer.,
"Works perfectly in concert with the web app.  Todoist, along with Evernote, are my main GTD tools.",
"Use the app most days, really like it, but please make the option of adding custom priorities and making priority labels more obvious",
"I have tried almost every to do manager out there and can safely say this is the best, so much so i bought the premium version. Currently i am using this for mine and shared teams with Mrs., and i use Trello for collaborating with a team of 32. Might switch from trello to this but not sure....",
"Best app ever to keep you organized. I tried a lot of apps before, but this one is easy to use and create sub tasks (the one feature I like the most).",
This app is indispensable in my day to day personal and business life. It's available for ALL my devices and the Web app is very clean and super functional.,
I paid for the full version and I use the outlook app and the android app. This thing is great. Its simple and the integration is seamless.,
I like the way it looks...  Very simple yet clearly reminds me that I haven't done something in time,
I'm using the premium version and it is amazingly simple. Evidently the team has put a lot of effort in making it user-friendly. Nothing like it.,
No recurring tasks. Also has been spamming me after I installed it.,
"Sub-tasks can have dates, notes etc.  Tried all the other major players and found them all wanting. Todoist takes a little extra learning but the payoff is worth it",
I love the ease of this app. I keep everything from work to home to homeschooling tasks. It helps me get right to work in the mornings. No need to hop online to check my to do list or find that piece of paper. I've never had a syncing problem either.,
"Works great! Has a clean interface and most of all its available for my our Outlook, Windows, Mac and my android. Now thats awesome!. I was a premium member of toodledo , tick tick, and wunderlist but nothing beats the clean interface of to do list.  I became a premium member within 24 hours",
Otherwise this app has really nice UI. Fix sync problem and i will reinstall Ur app.,
I love this app ' s simplicity.  It is so easy to enter my to dos and then order them.   The daily digest email is great reminder to start the day.,
I've tried several apps and find this app awesome... mebe because of the simplicity.  It's the only app where I search and see all the task need to be done..,
"Unfortunately, I can't afford the payed version and the free version doesn't include tags. I want to setup GTD so I've moved to Wunderlist which supports tags even in free version...",
"I've tried loads of productivity apps over the years, and this is excellent - even without the premium upgrade. Highly recommended",
"I like most being able to label different projects, create tasks and subtasks and color code them. It does what I need it to do and looks very clean.",
"Try it, it keeps you on track. Nag ware though, reminds you of when you haven't done something.",
"I really like this app, too bad the best options are only for suscribers!",
"I've tried many task management apps, including Any.do, Trello, Groupiful, Wunderlist, and various Google Tasks apps. Todoist is by far the best, especially with its collaboration features, which allow you to share projects and assign tasks. Overall very powerful, and well thought out so that power is easy to use.",
This app has really helped me get my act together. I was having a difficult time keeping up with all I had to do and when I needed to pay what. All that is over now.,
"Does everything I need pretty much. Sync is flawless, allows for attachments, scheduling system is easy and intuitive, all in a free or cheap wrapper. Would love to see some more integration with productivity suites and utilities (dropbox, Google drive, evernote, etc).",
Great so far! You've nailed the repeating tasks feature.,
"After trying most every to do list app out there, have now committed to using Todoist. Great platform coverage and easy, but powerful feature set. Lots of development happening as well.",
"Simple and clean design, enough customisation to be able to categorise tasks, and the widget and notification option to quickly add a task are just as you would wish. Add to that a web and Windows client. Perfect!",
"Reminders, recurring tasks.  I love it. Thank you for creating it, would highly recommend.",
I've tried so many to do lists apps for a long time and Todoist is the only one that really works across platforms with the simplicity and functionalities that help you to get things done :),
Simple yet very useful. It helps me a lot in organizing personal and work stuffs.,
It's the best app for me in productivity management.I used it a lot when I am about to launch any new website or task scheduling. The window version may need some improvement in term of synchronization.But above all it's the best app for me.,
"Easy to use and very imtuitive. I love the integration with Gmail, the Google Chrome app but most of all the Android app. Its easy to set up todoist to the way you work with projects and labels. Recomend it hands down.",
"I keep track of multiple work projects at one time and no matter where I am I can write myself a note and have it on my phone, my tablet and my computer.  It's rapidly becoming indispensable.",
I really find this app useful for keeping lists and staying up-to-date.,
Works effectively and smoothly. Integrates well with android and appears to be few bugs,
"I use this app on my phone and tablet to keep me on track. It works perfectly with both, syncing with no issues. It has all the features I need and more.",
"Been trying task / productivity software and methods for maybe 20 years. It's not an exaggeration to say I have tried almost anything out there, on maybe ten platforms - pen and paper included. WELL: this rocks. First time I have the feeling it is exactly what I need. (BTW, did not even need the premium features, but bought as a thank you)",
"Great ui, easy and intuitive.",
Im a bit forgetful so this app comes in really handy. Keeps me organized.,
So far the best to do list I've found. I just wish it would not remove the completed task but would cross off that task instead. If possible please add that feature.,
"I love this app. It works well with all my tools, from chrome to the web, to my mobile. I have one set of todos to work on, and complete. The sharing tools and natural language entries are icing on the cake",
Have converted all my lists and overflowing inboxes to this app. I can't imagine being without it now! Much more organised.,
"Best to do list manager I've seen. Project mgmt, priority settings, labels that support GTD contexts. Easy to use.",
I have tried 4 different apps and this is by far the best one. Just add locations and improve the layout.,
"I've used most of the task management applications out there but this of by far the best. Fast beautiful interface, clean. Awesome app.",
"No quibbles yet, after 2 weeks. I like swiping off tasks: as satisfying as popping bubble wrap.",
Great app/program. Todoist is awesome and extremely well done.  Keeps me on task across multiple platforms and devices. Easy to use and intuitive. Very responsive customer service. Purchased the premium after using the free version for about a month. Location based reminders are sweet.,
"Started using it slowly and the points were pretty encouraging! Must try the free version. I have tried a lot of productivity apps, but this one is really helpful and easy to use. Also, lists and projects can be shared by other people and across various platforms which is so very convenient!",
The ability to sync with  my other devices makes it a very useful list maker. Like the way reminders can be send by sms. Would like to be able to see notes without having to actually open them.,
"This app is the best app for to do lists you can get,  it syncs across devices and is really easy to use!",
"Was a massive help to me at work, one thing though, i signed up for the paid app but couldn't use some of the functions like voice recording.",
I would love to see a task start date so I can keep track of kpi and to export to an excel file so I can  create reports for my boss too.,
It helps me get organize with things I need to do.,
4 of 5 is pretty good .. i feel its still missing smthn.. u guys need to update the appearence and enhance the app,
"After searching for years for a decent system for managing my tasks and projects, todoist is as close as I have come to managing my tasks successfully. Plug ins for Chrome make adding tasks from Gmail so easy. Thanks todoist!",
This app is exactly what I wanted and needed! I love that I can see my week at a glance week and the ability to select what I want to display on the widget. Well done giving just enough power to the user without being overwhelming.,
The most stable to do list app for android. It's fast and available for all device :D,
I have used plenty of to-do lists but this simple to use but does not have a search option. That would be helpful.,
I love the app and will likely pay for the pro version. However I wish it wasn't $30 to upgrade as I only need one or two features.,
My favorite feature is that nothing leaves your to do list until you cross it off!  Days later you will receive an email about things you did not do!   Absolutely love it!,
"A to do list app and then some. There are recommendations for getting the most out of the app, a plethora of features, community forums and more. You can even share and delegate tasks. Android and apple.",
"The app helps tremendously with the management of my life. It would be nice, however if ""tasks"" were an option of choice. Meaning, ""CALL"" is listed as a choice as to what I need to do, and all I do, then is add the name and number. Otherwise, loving what's here and enjoy using the app. Thank you.",
App is free but so crippled (a task app with no reminders?) that is just a way to sell a subscription based service with a hefty fee...,
l had a problem with my premium subscription. I emailed the developer and got an immediate response. The whole problem was sorted in less than 15 minutes! Great service!!,
Love being able to manage tasks across multiple platforms and easily share them with others. It's been a huge help as I try to stay on top of everything that needs to get done for a big event.,
Like this app very much. Works in Outlook and on Android phone. Browser version and desktop version didn't open but the other versions meet my needs,
"Ok,  here is a list of what I have tried over the years to no avail until I got into this 100%. any.do, Wunderlist, asana, GTD, Evernotes Reminders, Google keep, Google now,  remember the milk and I'm sure a lot more.  Save yourself the hassle this is the best....",
"I have tried a good few task management applications with apps for devices and have enjoyed the ease of To-Doist the most so far.  I work in security at an admin level and am constantly in need of note and task management on the fly.  Once I had this service across my wealth of devices , the more I find it my go to!!!  Great job!",
High quality app with several features but the full version is very high priced,
"Had some issues with the widget syncing up correctly lately. Otherwise, a favorite that I use daily!",
The fact that the features are limited compared to some apps out there is no disadvantage. This app does everything I require from a todo list! Brilliant!,
Has everything that a todo. platform needs. However I feel that it should be easier to add tasks (may be take something from ios reminders). You shouldn't need to click a '+' to add tasks.,
This is a great app for keeping track of your tasks. It satisfies just about every need I've got to keep me organized. I'll be paying  up for the premium version very shortly.,
Best app by far! Check off system and daily email alerts help me stay accountable with what I have to do!,
So far the best app I've used for todo management. Consistent across all platforms.,
"Solid, really easy to use.  Love that I have a great tool to keep me on task.",
"Terrific, but not quite as intuitive to navigate via the app.",
Nothing to complain about. Love the integration on phone and pc. Considering the premium because it works so well! Love the extra goodies like the karma-points.,
Links perfectly between all of my devices. No more post it notes everywhere.,
"This app has replaced all the random written to-do lists I used to keep at home, work, in the car, in my purse, etc. I like the clean GUI and being able to connect via the app on my phone, online, or at desktop.",
"Use it daily, great utility in the free version but the premium tools are worth it for me.",
Works. All i can say and needless to say more. :D,
Great for project task sharing in small groups. .. cloud sync is superb. .. couple of dumb inconsistencies in the interfaces between operating systems. .(eg selecting a time for a task ).. otherwise excellent,
The app is very well organised and the notification allows you to add any task wherever you are on the phone making it easier to add tasks.,
"The app is great - I wish a few more features were available for free, but you guys gotta eat as well, I suppose.",
"User interface is beautiful.  Manage tasks, projects and more. Reminders keep you in check.  Great app!  Good job!!",
Quite like the app. But having a one time payment would have been better than having subscriptions.,
"I use basic html tags pretty heavily,  and it is supported on the Web but not in this app.   So my tags clutter the list on my phone.   Hopefully this is in the near future!",
"The best for clean creation, organization and completion of tasks. Has never crashed, and has the easiest widget to use.",
This tool has definitely assisted me keeping track and prioritizing the multiple bits and pieces of my job needing to be accomplished on any given day.,
"This app had increased my personal productivity just by existing. It's easy to use, non invasive, and has quickly become my list maker, calendar and community scheduling tool.",
Only missing aspect is fully integrated collaboration. Really sleek and wonderful design that I use daily!,
Does everything well on all devices. Some UI improvements could make the experience better. Definitely best in the market.,
"One question though, how can you set a task on repeat for all days? , for example reading two chapters of a book everyday",
"Easy to use, has everything you need without taking more time then needed to organise.",
Works very well and I love the widget with al my upcoming to do's and ability to cross them off or postpone them!,
"Great app with great design and functionality, best todo app I've tried in years.",
I moved from any.do to todoist and I am not going back. Great features and simple use.,
It really helps me get more organized with all of my school work. I love it!,
"Todoist is a great, simple, functional app. I love the look and how effectively it syncs across platforms.",
This app provides an easy way to share to-do lists and shopping lists with friends and family. Highly recommend.,
I really liked how it works.it has a nice interface too.good app :),
Great to do list app. Works well with many calendar apps and across platforms.,
"I do love this app. It makes it so easy to capture tasks, organize and prioritize.",
"Todoist is an essential aspect in my tool chest.  It keeps me on track,  across multiple platforms.",
I love the interface!! Here are somethings that could make it better though. - timed reminders even in the free version. App reminders,
Helps in organizing the entire project and really great to coordinate with others.,
"Todoist is very helpful, but there are hundreds of features that could be added to make it amazing.",
18.99 A YEAR! I would consider if its for life but a year. Software is cheaper.,
Helps me and my team to achieve much more than before,
"Perfect sync, moto g to nexus 7. Near perfect productivity app.",
Does the job perfectly. Happens to be one of the best apps out there in its segment.,
It is my personal planner. It is just awesome greatest app I have downloaded.,
I use it for my business. Styled the chrome plugin to my taste and now it's perfect,
Don't know what I would do without it.,
"Annoyances: [1] no advanced multiple editing of tasks, [2] tedious editing of level & hierarchy of subtasks, [3] Sometimes, subtasks become separated from their parent task higher up the hierarchy, [4] setting reminders could be easier (prefer 4.4 KitKat's time picker), [5] impossible to edit reminders already set, [6] can't delete tasks in ""Completed tasks"" view, [7] ability to duplicate tasks would be nice, [8] location-aware reminders is unreliable & beta-like. [9] editing notes not user friendly at all",
I'm able to keep on top of everything with this beauty. Download it now. Better yet- get the Business version!! You won't regret it 👍,
"Great app. Granted to get the full benefit you have to get the premium version, but it's totally worth it!",
"My lifeline for staying on task with multiple clients, projects, and jobs. Love it!",
So far so good. Haven't explored it completely yet.,
I can now make my to do list as I think of things randomly throughout my day,
Really helped me manage projects effectively. Love the intuitive UI.,
"I wish I notifications were a bit more like any.do, but besides that I'm loving it!",
Love the app..easy to use and transfer things that are not done or carried forward,
Really like how this interfaces with all my tools and that I have all my 'to do' lists combined,
Great App! Helps me stay on top of things on a daily A+++,
Great way to ensure you've completed everything assigned to you and what you've assigned others to do.,
Love that it can send a daily reminder too.,
Like the designations available. Wish it would sync to google calendar for better centralization for me.,
This is a thoroughly useful application.  I am so glad I've found it.  Thanks.,
I understand the need to have a premium version to support this wonderful app. But it needs to have reminders in the free version for this to be useful,
"It is simple, user friendly and contain all the requirement.",
Effective app! Helped me a lot in organizing and prioritizing tasks.,
Works great! Outlook integration is a lifesaver.,
"Too many features to be unlocked by premium. Other than that, excellent!",
Best to do app I've ever used. Clean and simple,
Crashes every time I open it,
"Widget let's you see all tasks clearly. Easy to add new tasks, set due dates, times, descriptions.",
Basic/free features are exceptionally well put together.  Highly recommended!,
Help me a lot when I am tracking 6 projects at the same time.,
"Brilliant app, but a bit costy if you want to go premium",
"Nice. No issues, works like it says!",
Great UI design and works faultlessly across all my devices.,
"One of the best app among wunderlist, anydo etc. Loved the interface and customizations.",
Very helpful indeed. Saves time personally and.professionally.,
Easy to use and simple organization of your tasks. Thanks!,
Exactly what I needed! Just to-do lists with no frills,
Free version is enough. Stress relieving. I use across all devices and desktop.,
Truly cross platform... Essential for such a tool. Always handy. And super easy to add tasks in android.,
"Easy to use, work just fine across devices.",
This app helps me to track & complete my activities.,
"Does everything I want it to, plus it integrates with sunrise! Fantastic.",
This will do everything you need to stay completely organized!,
"It's very helpful, simple and practical. I highly recommend it!!",
app designers these days sure think we have long thumbs.  options for controls at bottom is lost,
"Tried Wunderlist, Any.Do and Todoist, this is the best among all three.",
"Easy to use, and really nice clean interface.",
Takes a small amount of time to get used to the setting up recurring tasks but not hard at all,
We post our grocery list and it works great.,
Perfect for remembering assignments. Use for all my homework and appointments!,
I really like this app. It works well for my needs.,
LOVE IT. Amazing and keeps me organized and productive.,
Simple and reliable. Can be accessed in many devices. Really helpful.,
Gets me to do lot of things,
Easy to use and I love the sync with my pc.,
It will be perfect if we can set an alarm or reminder notification for a task.,
Solid interface that's simple to use and sync with my wife.,
It really good. Know hopefully don't forget something,
It helps me keep track of my chores and assignments.,
Tried a lot of task/calendar apps.So far this is the best.,
Exactly what I needed to juggle the different areas of my life.,
Just learning how to use this.  Very satisfied so far.,
"With integration with Sunrise calendar, it is an invaluable tool",
I juat started using this app but so far it seems very useful.,
"Being able to customize the widget, colors and transparency would give it a 5.",
I find this app helps me to organize what I need to do and to get more done.,
Love this tool and its system for organizing my day. Love the portabilty,
I love the premium version. Email and template options are great,
This app is dope. Love that its synced with the chrome app. Makes my workflow amaaaze.,
"Sync fast, easy to maintain, and encourage you updating your work.",
Recommend for cross platform task keeping.,
"Good app.  I like it,  but still learning how to use it more.",
Keeps me organized and sane for my classes and day to day life!,
Great app. Fingers crossed for more awesome integration with other useful apps.,
This is by far one of the best to do list apps. Love the integration with Sunrise.,
Really helps get things organized & done .,
"Love this app. Works great, instant sync between my laptop, phone and tablet.",
The features offered for free are awesome. The premium features are just icing on the cake.,
This app is helping me keep track of my daily tasks,
The upgrade version might be better dont know,
Easy to use and syncs across multiple platform easily make this a go to productivity app,
Useful in our businesses  help each other see what is on the agenda.,
Remembering made easy without being annoyed.,
Just one word. I have no more to add.,
Excellent app and more importantly excellent development team. Very helpful and receptive to suggestions.,
Very helpful and easy to use...Took me 5 mins to get used to...,
Very useful app that keeps me up to date with all of my tasks.,
Good to forget task and unnecessarily increase tension.,
"User interface is nice, having due dates on tasks is very useful",
Best to do list from the 1000s that I have tried out till now.,
Sometimes something just totally happens the right people all in sync and this is it gives me total control without having to worry thanks,
This is really very nice one,
It really heps in managing the activities great app,
Super easy to use and actually lives up to the promise,
A very good tool for improving productivity,
Definately better than other task manager applications,
Could use more offline features but overall great,
I like the integration with Sunrise calender,
I like the way todoist synchronize over my PC and Device,
My tovdo list is very helpful I can choose date awesome,
Great app but quite a few of the basic features require upgrade to paid version,
It does what it says!,
Has been a great help in boosting my productivity,
Best I've come across amongst the many options available...,
Once you get into the habit of punching in your tasks it becomes second nature the widget on the home screen is awesome as well,
Love this app. Always adding new features.,
Go elsewhere. Not intuitive. No way to SHARE. I purchased  subscription and tried again!!! No luck. No instructions. No links. What a mess. Go Wunderlist. Ps. I unsubscribed and got my money back.,
"I am hooked! This app is just what I have been looking for. Minimal UI, beautiful layout, easy to use - I'd you're looking for a ""to do"" app, snatch this one up. I went ""premium"" on my second day of using it. It's worth the price. The ""free"" version is great as well.",
Love how this app manage my task and the filter is great. Any background image would be perfect.,
App Essencial.. installed in my all devices.,
Works superub in online and offline mode across platforms. . .,
"And whilst there are one or two features I miss and I would like... For 'getting stuff done', simple ease of use, integration and synchronisation across platforms...  This IS the one!",
"Fast on all devices (chrome, android phone & tablet). First to-do app I have paid for the premium features (and it is worth every penny).",
Nice ui. Would be nice to make fonts larger.,
A great interface to the main app.,
"Helps being organized and productive, definitely worth the download",
Wow! Just downloaded the app and I already love it!,
Enjoying it. Superb App!,
Everything I need to get my day sorted but it would be nice if was more color coded more bright,
Very useful app,
"Very practical, at least  use the free version",
Great apps.. love it but can be improvise,
Even The free version.,
Has been helping with life a lot.,
Very useful app to plan your chores well.,
Reminds me if things and works gr8,
Its really fun to use,
"Good apps, but need more improvement on assign task",
My favorite app for to do lists!!!,
It just performs flawlessly,
Syncs better and looks nicer than evernote,
It is just amazing app for high productivity,
Just what I was looking for great and sync with my calendar,
I enjoy every moment of this app,
Switched from Wunderlist to ToDoist an don't regret it.,
Awesome app for people with ADD/ADHD. Not that I would know what....,
"Perfect app,i like the idea of synchronisation",
Love it. Finally a decent to-do app,
I've tried all.  not most....  All todo and task management software...  and this is simply the best.,
"Useful, specially with the Chrome extension.",
Very useful for me,
Good app for helping stay productive.,
Keeps me organized.,
Love this app !very helpful! !!,
I had to use note pad for keeping note. Now i m keeping it on the apps. Said goodbye to the note pad.,
Keeps me on the right track.,
"Works really good,  is simple and efficient.",
life made easy.,
"Nice to note to do task,",
Great app...and I have tried them All,
Useful tool for planning. Thanks for it :),
"Very easy to use, I love it",
100%,
Can't believe someone would pay £19 annual subscription for this (£1.58 a month!!). Free version very limited and disappointing. Uninstalling to free up 13mb.,
Simple & did its job easily & nicely,
"It's time to change the world, what an awesome",
Keeps my projects on track,
I used it every day,
If used properly this is a very effective app,
Does exactly what its meant for,
Scope to improve and new features,
Would be awesome if a saved email task could be viewed across all of the shared members instead of being stored on the task creators account,
Love it. Free app with excellent uses.,
One of the good productivity app in the market..,
I've tried all the apps in this category & this is the best,
Hace mas sencillo recordar y visualmente atractiva,
It is a good app.  Helpful.,
Does everything you need it to do,
Just what I need in a to do list,
Saving my life (and organizing it).,
Best task taking app and period.,
Great for free wouldn't pay though,
Does what I wanted,
must b able to change currency,
Nice cross platform todo app,
Makes organizing easier,
Easy to make notes,
Still looking for the right one,
Easy to use and lovely interface,
Great cross platform to do manager,
Very comprehensive.,
Not upgrading. Why does a to do app need to know where I am. Lame.,
Great for daily task tracking.,
Very usefull collaboration tools,
absolutely worth the money.,
"Considered it has project monitoring function, can we have a review mode to assess the project performance?",
Option for all sub tasks to inherit priority of parent task,
"Simple, yet powerful",
Excelente manera de que nada se olvide!,
Best app ever!!!!!! Bying it today.,
Would be great if this were added!,
Just loved it. The best.,
Best task manager I've found so far :-),
Very handy and useful app.,

"Please allow us to see finished tasks (without going to the settings bar). Also, please add a location alarm (something like what Google Keep has).",
todoist and wunderlist,
Must have,
Works well,
It ing,
no reminder,
Productivity++,
Imi place Categorizarea sarcinilor! Sincronizarea excelenta! Ce mi-aș dori ... e ... sa pot exporta sarcinile direct in Calendarul gmail cu ore exacte. Nu sunt sigur ca este posibil tehnic.,
Ok,

Mantap,
"Simple to use, great UI, lots of options : well thought and well executed. PLEASE make it a collaborative tool!!! Otherwise as great as it is to manage projects todos, it defeat its purpose if it can't be used at Team/company level!!!! It would very easily be a 5 star rating if it was team/collaborative to do App.",
"This app is exactly what I needed! Super simple, yet very complex if I choose to go down that route.  It is always with me reminding me of what I have to do ""today.""  And it keeps me on track by showing me my daily progress. I am able to stay accountable to me!",
"Yes,  it may not be the best out there,  but I rely on to-do lists for my entire daily life.  This does it flawless.",
Very easy and clear... Like the way it feeds outlook. No problems syncing across all devices like some,
I love using this app and how it helps me daily to organise my tasks. I still have to try all the features but I quite impressed so far!,
So easy to use.  Gets me through my daily lists in such a simple manner.,
Very nice app to organize your life and work. Some desired features are missing though.,
Best ToDo manager with loads of device support including outlook and Gmail integration,
"Does just about everything I want, except import Google tasks",
Beautiful design and easy to understand. Recommend it :),
"...for finally fixing the notification reminders, oh goodness it's nice to no longer worry about missing or forgetting to do anything on the To Do List!!!",
"Clear interface, very easy to use",
I believe it's overpriced.,
"Great, easy to use app until the update and all my entries are gone?",
Good App,
Using it since last 2 years. Can't live without it. Wonderful web application top with Microsoft outlook integration(not from app) for tracking actions coming from emails as we'll...,
"But not as user friendly as the Todoist website, especially in entering custom dates.",
I can't live without it nw. Love hw I cn sync it with my computer~,
I love this app! And the only feedback I have is that I feel the UI when you enter the app is a bit congested with stuff! I was wondering (hoping) if there are any plans for the UI to be less clumped with stuff ? :) other than that I love it!!,
"Clean, simple, functional.  Does what its supposed to without getting in the way",
Works splendidly.,
If only it wasn't so expensive.,
Very streamlined task manager,
Better than any.do,
Great app,
Brilliant,
"I use this as part of my GTD system and find it world's really well. It's not really a GTD app like nozbe or omnifocus, but I find that actually works in its favour as you have to create your own system within it. A system that does it for you is like having a chauffeur when you really need to learn to drive.  Todoist is a system that finds that sweet spot between functionality,  flexibility and simplicity. great app.",
"Although the UI does not have the ability to change or tweak to each users preference (I'm thinking different colors), Todoist is great. Clean look, straightforward, and very flexible. Highly recommended for those who are in need of a simple, yet effective way to organize their lives.",
"This app syncs all over that place, I love it. The app is almost perfect but one thing it doesn't do that Any.DO was good at is generating tasks from missed calls, as follow-ups to completed meetings, etc. And how about email notification on task completion.",
"Todoist has a great deal of potential as a to do app. Unfortunately, for me it is missing a VERY important piece of functionality. The ability to add reminders to tasks should not be a Premium option and without it, Todoist is not a feasible option for my use. If this could be fixed, I would seriously consider switching back to Todoist.",
"Im using this for general stuff nothing important, would buy if it was couple a quid but not gonna subcribe... and not too usefull without all the features, other then that, really nice app.",
The design is really nice and the functionality is great. The features given for free are very nice but I think that reminders should be included for free as they are one of the most important ways of making sure that you get things done. Other than that the only problem I have is the fact that the extra features are subscription-based. I would happily pay a decent one time payment for the full features and not have to worry about ongoing payments.,
"Really helps me be organized. I especially like the reporting and views of completed tasks. Some apps assume you won't want that, I get satisfaction looking back at what I've done. Even more reporting and metrics would be cool too",
Top marks for being everywhere and being relatively painless to use. But a yearly recurring fee to have tags and notes feels a bit steep.,
"The app layout is nice enough and it seems well put together, but let's get real, 30 bucks a year?  Not in this lifetime.  Maybe a one-time fee of $10 for the app.  I'm getting really tired of developers constantly trying to bleed consumers for niche software.",
"Beware of offline mode. When you reconnect, there's a high chance that it will pull the latest from the cloud and overwrite all of your offline changes. I found this out the hard way.",
Clean and fast and super easy to organise everything. Kind of annoying how you can't easily view overdue tasks though. It would be nice to have an option to postpone them or  change the date instead of them disappearing.,
"The app is ok and has interesting features - some may even be outstanding (like the location awareness - if it gets available on Android,  too). It is a pity, that there is no way to try many of these without buying the premium version. The UI is not very intuitive at some places. And why the Windows version has no real alert feature but insteads ""alerts"" you by sending ""emails to self"" is beyond me! ||-(  However, the biggest shortcoming which is making the app practically useless to me, is the missing sync with Outlook tasks!  The suggested way to import OL tasks into Todoist via ""email-to-self"" can only be called unrealistic (to state that very politely)! But also the other direction, forwarding a task's completion entered in Todoist to Outlook (and thereby possibly triggering notifications to other people) would be an absolute requirement for using Todoist in any typical office environment.  Concluding: an interesting app, but waiting for the absolutely required sync-capability with Outlook (at least in the PC version)!",
The app itself is good. The date interface  is still awkward. Should focus less on being pretty and more on making repeating tasks something you don't have to learn special syntax for.,
I like this app very much. It keeps reminding me of what I must do.,
"I use this app daily to manage all kinds of lists, and it's not perfect, but it is the most versatile and robust list manager I've found for android, and it keeps getting better. Thanks, guys!",
Would like to be able to change font size. Would also be good to add sharable lists (separate from individual tasks).,
"If u need to get things done but are one of those people who needs to see it all in front of u, download this app.",
"Easy to use and very easy to add and update tasks. Syncs across all my platforms, android, iPhone and chrome browser.",
"I would appreciate that if "" to do "" list can also appear like a screensaver wherein without opening the app we can peep into the activities",
"Has been a huge help for keeping track of everything, from home to work. Easy to allocate tasks to colleagues or family members, with the option of creating projects and sub projects.",
"Great UI and functionality, however I don't feel that reminder alarms are something I should have to pay $30/yr for. Also, sync with Google Tasks would be an excellent feature to include.",
Thanks for continuous improvement and REAL cross-platform dedication... works great in all 3 of my operating systems.,
"Tried a few todo lists. This is the most stable, most fully featured,  one I have used. Look also for the Todoist web browser plugins and Outlook plugin.",
This is simple and intuitive app and helps me complete things on the go.,
Many options but never too complicated & user interface very well designed on all platforms,
"For me this is the best to do list app with simple clean interface, team extensions and good calendar integration",
"I live in a constant state of chaos. By nature I am not organized at all, but todist has started giving a slight organization to my madness.",
"Very thorough, it would be nice to have some custom backgrounds and to print the lists. But otherwise it does a great job in the GTD format. Highly recommended.",
Always syncs instantly. Awesome tools for multi-tiered prioritization. Far superior to several other listing apps I've used.,
Using this as a companion app to evernote I have absolutely everything I need as far as notes/reminders go. Plus organizing and prioritizing your notes is SO easy. I use it everyday to keep me on track in my life.,
"Still figuring out exactly how to best make it work for me, but good to keep track of items for time being.",
I just love the subtasks &  how it's to deal with the app i use this as a daily to-do app & wunderlist as a life time file where i can fill it with wish lists & big goals. Both are quite amazing,
Love it.  Works on virtually any platform.  Love that it has an Outlook addin.  The app is also very clean looking.  Pro version is only $29 for the year and is a must have.,
Organised all aspects of my life. I now have a to do list for everything. Syncs across every device I own.,
I love this app. I have trouble with remembering what has to be done. Now I am less stressed and can focus on the task at hand,
"1. Syncs across my Mac, iPhone and Android devices. 2. Love the use of logical dates like every two weeks etc. 3. Categorization is nice too",
"Love this. Simple, clean, straight forward. Everything I need and nothing I don't. My family adores this app.",
On the weekend I downloaded about 20 different Task apps and this is the only one that covered everything I wanted and how I wanted. Love the setup and cross platform support. Hopefully it holds up over time but first impression is fantastic.,
"I've tried Wunderlist, Any.do, Google Keep, Remember the milk, Astrid and so many others that I've forgotten their names. All of them lacked in some way or the other. But Todoist was the one that I found complete in every aspect. Planning soon the buy the premium subscription!",
Todo apps depend on your personal preferences. So I'm not going to judge based on the features in this. This is as simple as it is feature-rich with essential reqs.,
"Have only been using To do it for about 2 wks.  Jury is still out, but second impressions are very good.  Much faster and better syncing across all my platforms.",
"Ever since Astrid died, I've been searching for a new todo app. I've been using Todoist for several months now, and it's the best one I've come across.",
Easy to use. Haven't fully explored.  Would like to be able to change the default reminder time.,
Great app. A better widget design (transparent background) will make it better,
This app has helped me increase my productivity. It encourages me to get more done. You can se how productive you are each day compared to other days.  The paid features are well worth it.,
"On the pro version I get a ton of use out of Todoist, but I just wish there were more dynamic mass editing tools!",
"I've been using the premium features under the free trial and I'm considering a paid subscription. I like the way this app game-ifies productivity, a la chains.cc.",
Works great to keep track of tasks and the ability to note down ideas into a hierarchy with priorities has boosted my productivity already after only using it for a small amount of time. With a simple clean user interface I highly recommend for managing personal projects,
Finally I found an useful app. Great job guys. Try to solve the default reminder changing option from thirty minutes to user oriented options.,
"Allows me to glance at my day's list, edit or mark items as complete & most importantly, allows me to capture new items whilst out and about. Absolutely brilliant! After only 3 days I don't think I could live without it.",
"I like the karma chart and productivity graph, since it motivates me to actually get things done.",
Easy to use for home and work and syncs across my work pc and phone. Thanks Todoist :-),
The best ToDo app I've used. The syncing is perfect! I also love the flexibility on repeating tasks.,
Free version is easy to use.  No issues on Droid or accessing web version.,
"No reminders - payed only. This is f***ing basic. I was willing to pay one fee, but they want annual fee for such a basic app. Cannot delete a task! I moved to Wonderlist and it is the best!",
With this app I have increased my productivity within my business and also allowed me to keep active on the most important tasks in order of importance. Owner of Black Nova Designs,
"Love this app so much i purchased the upgrade.  Very simple clean format.  Non complicated, easy to edit. So far works for every type of tasks that I've  entered.  Biggest pro is tasks can be set up for large and small task or projects and can be  displayed in an easy to read format without having to search through project assigments.  Prints well from the online browser version which is great for project meetings.  I havent tried viewing historical completed tasks yet so cant comment on it.",
Very versatile and adaptable to the way I work. I wish changing the date wasn't a two step operation.,
Cool to do list that provides alerts and reminders & let's you define projects so clear separation.,
"I use this all the time! I have it on my browser, my email, and my mobile devices. It allows me to manage my life in the way I want it. If you care about taking control of your life then you need todoist!",
I like it so far. Notifies me on phone and other devices. Keep up the good work.,
Really enjoy using this app I just wish I had a place two put but I'm as well as the day,
"Really love it, bought premium in a month. Try it out yourself",
"Just installed,try to make a task for today, the reminder clock need premium upgrade. All i can get it just a normal note check task. It just look alike silly notepad application! Uninstalled!",
"I almost deleted Todoist when I saw that it did not sync with exchange. But then, I decided to read a little and see exactly how it worked. Man, am I glad I did! With the outlook plugin, the online account, & the Android app, this is the solution I have been looking for, and is already helping to clear my head (and it has only been 24 hours!). I look forward to learning more about how to incorporate the tools here into my daily routine. Also, this together with Cal makes a perfect combo.",
Syncing different platforms was a great feature.looking to see till date feature being introduced soon.,
"I made each separate topic in my life a separate project, e.g. ""work"", ""dogs"", etc.. to dos go within each respective project and I can make sub tasks under bigger to dos. Love it!",
"Tried to use it, but it crash too often. Uninstalled.",
Great app. One of the best I have seen for task managing and I use them a lot!,
The app keeps me updated on the things that I need to accomplish,
"Great app that starts with to-do lists and adds accountability, scheduling, and a great interface!",
Exactly what I had been searching for. Syncs very smoothly between devices.,
I've tried many different to do / task management apps for business over the years.  I tried the free version of Todoist for one day and upgraded to the full version that night! Absolutely worth the money for a year!,
Good app but high ram usage fix it please,
Great app easy to use. Got my life back in order now.,
Very clever way at sorting out your tasks and then easily share them.,
I get 10tmes more done in a day wuth this app.,
This app is great. Been using it for a week and I love it.,
Very clean ui.  No clutter. App for many devices and os.,
"This was the first time I am using it, it is excellent",
Nice app ... I like that I can use it on several of my toys.,
Best and easiest one I have found so far.,
Love the way you can T it up with other devices. .,
Please have a quick postpone button during reminder,
The app works like a breeze. . Just as it promisea Todo.,
"It's hierarchical, it's clean,  it's the best way to manage tasks.",
Love the integration between gmail and the to do list. Just what I needed.,
"Fits all my needs, and is pretty",
With my world domination plans.,
Would like to see addition of pomodoro techniques.,
Apps works as described.,
Very effective product. Does what is needed with great flexibility,
I think that this task manager or project manager is great for any person or business that have many task going on at one time,
I just installed it but it seems cool,
Straightforward to do app with good reminders and GTD focus,
Best to-do app out there,
Loved it - but gcal sync is missing,
Basic and simple to use for personal and business stuff,
Wonderful waiting for trying the premium,
Probably the best task manager around,
Recommended for anyone.,
Great app. Worth paying for the extras.,
Best task manager out there,
Simplemente increíble esta aplicación.,
Its helped me get everything done in time.,
Quite useful... Much better than Google tasks.,
"I think when i shared a project, all subprojects must be shared too",
"Good program, but not using it because you cannot sort by date ? Weird",
Great app!,
Great app!,

Excellent,
Wow app,
"Самый лучший сервис на данный момент по ведению задач как в одиночку, так и в команде. Есть все что нужно для ведения много плановых задач с множеством контекста.  Попробуйте и не пожалеете.",
Todoist,
My first impression was that it would be great for projects in school and at work but for everyday things it just doesn't seem to work for me. However I have yet to use the app enough so take my opinion with a grain of salt. One thing I liked the most though was it's slick design capabilities and function.,
"I've used several list-type apps, but this is the only one that I can look at and directly correlate to an increase in my personal productivity. ToDoist has become an integral part of my daily routine. I actually paid for the premium version - and I am a notorious cheapskate when it comes to apps. For me, it's worth it to be able to have it on my Android phone, Android tablet, iPad, Chromebook, laptop and desktop (yes, I have way too many pieces of tech gear). Great job!",
"If you just want to dump some info quickly, this app is propbably fime.  But if the information you store is important, find another app.  This is the second time todoist has silently lost my information.  Often it will work fime for months between these glitches.  This level of quality is totally unacceptable for any serious user.",
"I cannot recommend this app if you want to sync with Google Calendar. I just upgraded to premium version to find out that sync to Google Calendar works once in 24h, and sometimes even that doesn't work. They should be honest about that and warn people ahead of time.",
"Todoist is great until you actually really start using it with multiple projects and many tasks.   Wouldn't you expect a way (filter)  to see all your current work-related tasks across projects at a glance,  without being distracted by personal tasks?  Who wouldn't?   Apparently the developers,  who didn't implement it and are less than responsive to the user community who has been begging for this for many months.",
Sincronicez flawlessly among the different platforms. It is a really good tool. The only thing that would be great to include is sincronization with calendar. I highly recommend it. The best I have found.,
I put a deadline to wed and it shows up on wed.  But when I add a new item it pushes my last item back a few days.,
I've been looking for a task organizer that syncs across all devices for a while and this is by far the best app out there.,
"Its very handy and doesn't get in the way, I guess my only complaint is that my nearest tasks are in the bottom of the widget",
Todoist has a solid set of features and their integration with web and gmail etc. makes this my favorite productivity software.,
"Widget is quite poorly designed, and there's just one choice and no customization. Wow. A todo app without a great widget is just useless for me.",
The UI is extremely clean and data entry is very fast and easy. I don't regret paying for Premium and could be the first app with paid subscription membership that I renew after a year. Awesome platform coverage. Only feature I'd like to see added is the ability to specify a start date.,
It's a perfect app for people with more than one thing to juggle at work.,
"This app would be fantastic with a widget for phones. Until then, it will be short of its potential",
A worthy app for anyone who likes to be on top of your business and personal tasks.,
Over the last few days the app has been my go-to app and ensuring that my set goals for any event are on point. It's very good.,
"Love it. Keeps getting better and better. If you need a cross platform todo solution, this is the best one out there.",
Have been an active user for over 6 months now and have found it very useful.  Have tried many others and this leaves then for dead.,
I love having my tasks and projects with me across every platform- from android to windows to the web. And now they've added location based reminders. It just keeps getting better!,
Love having a mobile app with full featured desktop site for more involved planning. I can imagine the paid version is even better but the free version is working for me so far.,
"I have used paper for two years into college to keep track of tasks and assignments, and I am just about to go completely digital thanks to this convenient app linked to my Google account.",
However it's a good app. Location reminder made me re install it. Good move.,
"I'm looking for an efficient, multi platform talk manager. I don't need a complex project management program. Todoit is the best I've found. Support is responsive the product is being maintained.  Worth every penny to upgrade to premium",
Great sync between different devices. The app is simple but effective and boosts the productivity level,
This is by far the best to do list and project manager.  I use it for all my personal projects and soon for work.,
And I haven't even tried the premium features,
"However, was sent new phone and widget doesn't come up as like the old.",
Love that it's multiplatform. I use it every day! Fantastic for keeping me organized.,
"Amazing app - user friendly, with tons of features. Would be five star, but needs smaller, dark/transparent widgets. 4x2 is far too big for an Android phone screen. (The description says ""leverage amazing widgets"", but there's only one.)",
Easy to use. Color coded. Keeps all my projects well organized making my deadlines easily met. Job (well) done!,
Ive tryed many different apps in the market and so far ive liked this one way more than the rest,
An easy to use but not simplistic app that works flawlessly across platforms.,
Much cleaner and more lightweight than any do and Astrid. I love it.,
I quit Google Keep to use this app.  Syncing is killer.,
"Clean, simple and easy to use. The free plan is enough to me.",
Missing some functionality I'd like but good at what it does do.,
Default avatars have similar colours. It is tough to distinguish that,
"I really love this app it has turned my very much busy days into easy days , I cannot live without it onwards.........",
wildly useful without trying to do too much.,
Hard to imagine how I managed life without Todoist!,
Cumbersome and not intuitive. Expectations not met.,
Simple and intuitive. One of the best to do apps.,
Does a great job organizing tasks,
Completed task is a premium feature. Other than that this is a good app.,
"Perfect, much better than competitors.",
simple and organizable. 100% recomendado !!,
Toi su dung thuong xuyen,
Update me all latest stuff,
Great day-to-day task tool for work,
Very user friendly and intuitive,
Great tool to interface with todoist.,
This app really works well for my mannerism across multiple platforms.,
The best to do app I have seen!,
It's a good and useful to-do app :),
Awesome app!,
Great app !,
I decided to subscribe for position based reminders. But before wanting that I used this for free fit months.,
Amazing app!!,
Awesome!,
Very useful app,
Great for staying organized,
Good interface,
Meanage. Does the job.,
Great,
Excellent,
Good,
Excelente,
Todoist,
"Upgrading. Replaced Motorola horror with Samsung S5 and the app works great, no crashes so far, and plays nice with others. Provides what I need for task organization and tracking. Could use repetitive reminders.",
"Love this app. Easy, well designed and so elegant.",
Simple but detailed. Instant updated access from all my droid devices.,
Disappointing,
Too Good,
Coool,
I understand that they are in business and need to make money. But it's still really annoying than most of the really cool features of this program or the day before you pay for them. If he was one time sure but I don't wanna pay that much money every single year. Overall a good app and it's really been helping me out.,
"Ive only used it a few times,  but allows me to create different projects and have items under each. Haven't given 5 stars as I haven't fully explored all functions yet. Ive tried a number of to do type apps and this one has been the easier and provides the flexibility with managing different projects",
"Just perfect. I used another To-Do app for almost 3 years, but yesterday I stumbled upon Todoist. I never thought anything could rival my beloved todo-app. I was wrong.  I love the fact that I can easily manage my todo-lists on my mobile as well as on PC. And the sync works perfectly, which I love oh so much.  A must-have.",
"I use Todoist on a daily basis to manage all my work projects and my home to-dos. I have been a GTD-style app user for five years and I have tried to organize and manage the 8+ projects I get every week at work in all of the apps listed in the title of this review. Todoist works the most intuitively, functions on the most devices and apps, provides the easiest scheduling and presents the simplest yet most informative interface of all of them.",
"Probably the best productivity app I've ever encountered. I'd upgrade to premium to have the unimportant but extremely useful options but a yearly fee is just too expensive. I wish it was just a one time purchase. Plus there're the bugs, whenever I sync some of the tasks suddenly become redundant.",
"I was in dire need of some organization and any ol' task manager would have done. Any.Do was great ... at first. But instead of encouraging me to get all my stuff done each day, it pestered me until I felt terrible. Todoist, right from the start, felt more friendly and focused on helping me -- not hounding me -- to get things done. Todoist comes with a clean and simple UI. It's easy to use. And if you use the Web or desktop clients, the Karma feature gives you a small but necessary hint of satisfaction.",
The app is highly useful for addressing projects and maintaining my tasks across these projects effectively. However I find the premium feature priced high and hence the 4 stars. Functionality wise there is no other app I need to look at for my needs. I would have loved to have the labels feature as part of the free account but even without that this is perfect for my requirements,
"I'm a student and professional. This helps me keep on top of the barrage of things I have to remember every day. Great because it integrates across platforms. I use it from my work pc,  home laptop and Android phone. Awesome work team",
"I was looking for a task list that I could share with my wife. I also wanted the ability to schedule tasks, and most importantly to rank them. I'm going to use this app as my Honey-Do list. She can prioritize junk around the house that needs doing.",
"Better than wunderlist or any other list apps, especially in terms of widget functionality. Easy to organize and categorize all tasks without even entering the app - feels like a bonus if you're trying to avoid taking up too much RAM and leaving apps opened. Could be a little more colorful I guess, but what it lacks in aesthetic appeal is definitely made up for in every other category.",
Really very expensive purchases. Inbox list view date time text size must be bigger please. It is very hard to read at the moment. Maybe you guys can give option of text size in seetings menu like medium small and large text size. And how I can see my done tasks.,
"There are plenty of other choices for  productivity monitors, I'm not sorry I chose Todoist. With a simple layout that allows users to easily set, sort, and prioritize reminders for projects, Todoist is making task setting a positive experience. My favorite feature is the tagging you can attach to tasks like a twitter handle, saving time otherwise wasted filtering through file folders. Totally worth the money!",
"I love the premium version. I wish I had a secretary, but with todoist I can balance research, class, and everything else.",
"I was using Google Calendar tasks but found it lacking. (No recurrence,  no priority flags,  etc). ToDoist has all the features I want, with broad platform support and a clean interface. It's so good, I recommended it to ~50 co-workers.",
Great app for checking and managing your todoist account on the go. support for push notifications is also a great feature.,
"This app has so much potential,  just needs the ability to change the default reminder setting. Defaulting to 30 min before the task you've created isn't very intuitive. If I'm specifying the time for my task, that should be the reminder time.",
"Love this app, great for tasking my team. Too many emails though.set it up via an email address you do not check or get notifications from.",
"Rivals Evernote in processing power, perhaps because of its simple interface, which was perfect for me. Though it doesn't have the many other note formats, I feel I like the simplicity for everyday listing use.",
Love the app. Eager to pay for a paid version but current subscription rate is a touch too expensive for me. Nevertheless best tasks app on the market. No questions asked.,
This is very comparable to the Omni focus that I'm currently using. All it needs is allow for notes on projects and level drag and drop features. Otherwise it's a great product.,
"Haven't looked at the paid version yet but the free one is very clean and tidy, as I use it more I can see the need to upgrade which is still affordable as things go compared to others.",
"I had to go pro, this app keeps me up to date on all my devices. It sends me push notifications and keeps me from procrastinating or reminds me when my mind wanders. Recommended.",
I have tried several programs and this is the best. Anything beyond free is too much. I use it for my personal to-do. Only issue is setting up the recurring part- probably intuitive to most users.,
"I wish it could be more persistent like an ""in my face"" type of task reminder almost like an annoying alarm clock so l can get my job done in a timely manner, just saying",
"This is really easy to use. I like that I can see my list in different ways, I get organized more quickly when I can find what I am looking for and this makes it easy. Awesome App for free.",
Without Todoist managing my tasks at work would be a nightmare. Excellent cross platform and device user experience.,
Used few apps before but they all are very complex for daily use...  This one is beautifully done.,
"Better than Astrid or any.do, with more features and cleaner UI. Notifications are good, and they're less obnoxious than Any.do. Well worth the price.",
This is probably the 5th app of this kind I've tried on both android and Mac platforms. What all the others lack Todoist has. Great app.,
Switched over cos Any.DO was giving me some issues after they launched the premium version. Todoist works great. I would go premium on TD if it were cheaper!,
I can create projects and assign tasks. Helps hubby and I get things done even when there's little time to chat about what needs to get done next,
It is a tool for helping me to stay on task. I don't have to try to remember what I am to do becaust it is always right there.,
"great apps, i can manage my to do list not only from my smartphone but also from my desktop and laptop and the conection between device is really good...good job",
"Its very simple to use. We can access it through our browser, gmail and app. The productivity graph also helps us to analyze everything.",
Great alternative to omnifocus. I really like it because it is multplatfom and syncs seamessly in between them. Just be aware that you really need to go premium in order to unlock the full potential.,
great app to keep track of your projects and tasks. integrates into google calendar and provides reminder options. best todolist app so far for me. best usage only in paid version tho.,
"Todoist is the perfect productivity app. I don't do anything unless I've first broken it down into tasks and put it into Todoist.  The app is easy to use and synchs  with the Web app. I've used other task lists,  but Todoist is far superior.",
Great app. Syncs very well on all my devices. Got the premium and killing it :),
This little app has proven to be just what I needed to keep ahead of my myriad tasks.  Easy to use and allows for moving things forward as needed without making new entries.,
I'm new to todoist. I struggle with organisation and have tried various systems. So far I'm feeling that todoist may well work for me.,
"Easy to manage lists of items. Set reminders using simple terms, push notification reminders, levels, labels are all very useful. Easily integrated with Evernote using Taskclone.",
Great app still. But after this update my daily repeating tasks repeat after as many days as number of subtasks it has. Please fix this. No option for feedback in the app.,
Much better than anything I used before. Gives you already a nice way to personalize. I'm looking forward to what's to come in the future!,
"I Like how simple And useful is,  it would be nicer If it let me  see the tasks that have been completed.",
So much functionality in just the free app. The thing I like about it is how easy the android app syncs with my windows and chrome app. And the latest version is even better.,
Really stable app and the sync with postbox mail app makes this an invaluable tool. Unfortunately there is no integration with Alfred. But no issues so far ;),
I find the app useful but the interface is a little boring. It could be more useful to have a scrolling calendar.,
"The premium version is worth it. 1st tool I found which works so well with all my devices: Outlook on win 8, Ipad and note 2",
I was an iPhone user for years and stuck with it because of the lack of a good alternative to Omnifocus. I finally feel liberated.,
Its really easy to use....only thing need to b added is that notifications should hv ringing option.,
Looks great on tablet. Solid cross platform selling point. Perhaps a bit unfairly tough feedback : Enhancements to long range planning and projects to earn the last star.,
"Great app to help remind you when a project is due or when an important appointment is coming up. All at a quick glance. Easy to use. Very intuitive,  no heavy learning curve. I love it!",
"Better priced for premium than Wunderlist,   interface synchronization works better,  more methods of sorting tasks as I prefer.  Would be very helpful,  however,  if I could import from Wunderlist.  I was able to use excel/txt to assist in making it faster but an automated important would be the key to a 5 star rating.",
Took me about 10 second to raise is been looking for this app for years and sign up for premium services.,
Working great so far. I like the way it lays out daily tasks and helps you stay on top of important items. The collaboration feature helps me delegate projects and task easily.,
"Great app to organise my whole life, especially work. Ability to colour code, prioritise, add tasks several levels down and use any kind of due date wording is great. The widget looks good and works a treat. I just installed the chrome plugin so it works with Gmail from my desktop. I just wish I could use this plugin feature from my Gmail app on my phone",
I'd like to be able to assign a project to a specific day & then open it when i want to see the tasks. Then i can plan my day by area first & then see the specific list when i'm at that project site.,
"Can't fault it. Used on pc,  ipad, iPhone and Android and syncs like it should. Easy to master and not full of useless features.",
Most user friendly to do list app I've used. I'm hooked. Love the simplicity & UI. Keeps me on track with notification alarms & emails. I honestly love it.,
"Todoist is a great application that works on multiple platforms. I can have it load on my phone, tablet and PC and keep up to date on what needs completion. Reminder by date and/or time. Also love the integration from Outlook as well. A very happy customer. :-D",
"Love the layout, widgets,  and postbox integration. I don't like that you all you get is labels and notes in the paid version",
First to do manager I've found that elegantly manages subtasks and projects. UI needs a bit of work but overall solid app,
I'm incredibly organized because of this easy-to-use app. I highly recommend it if you need help keeping track of all your responsibilities.,
Impressive UI design but a MASSIVE battery hog! Phone is drained in almost 2 hours!!!! Had to uninstall just to keep my phone useable. I was tempted to upgrade to the paid feature set to get Calendar Sync but it's essentially broken! It only syncs once a day and it's only a one-way sync. I'm guessing the Devs are Apple users. Google provides calendar APIs that sync more than once per day but they stick to the Apple iCal standard instead. Back button also ejects you from program at times. Frustrating!!!,
"Superb productivity app.  One feature required,  recurrence from completed date. One star less for that.  Otherwise five star quality app.",
"I've never been able to watch the tutorials on the website. I can't log in. But just tooling around and trying to figure it out, it's pretty great! Wish I could really get it",
"I've been through many to-do apps and this one really hits the mark. Nice cloud integration across devices, we'll designed app, Chrome Extension support, and handy email-to-task feature. Overall, a great app that has quickly become my work and life task management system.",
"I have used a number of ""to do"" apps but this one is by far the best. So simply once you get to now it and really good to look at. I also like the option to share to do items.",
I used this app for 3 months now and replace RTM with it.  The major reason us the consistent interface on the apps and web.  It make my tasks planning easy especially if I need to plan large amount of tasks for the quarter.,
"Excellent app, I use it on my phone, outlook, gmail and desktop. My best tool fighting messiness.",
May be this is the best app in project management I have ever used...but it is very pricey for almost basic features,
Versatile productivity tool. Broad connectivity options. Breakdown tasks into subtasks. And set due dates. Reminders premium feature.,
Not too much or too little.  Hard thing to say for an app these days.,
"We've been using this app to coordinate work at my office, so far its working like a charm! I would like to see a Holo dark version / theme for the app and the widget though.",
"I got the premium version, my search for a good todo app is finally over. Syncs well. Priority and project options for organizing lists. Nice reminders and summary. Can access on desktop in browser or through chrome extension.",
Needs slightly better search and more versatile batch changes and it's done,
.but not perfect - when snoozing a reminder it never shows up again!,
"Perhaps not as intuitive as the web version, but very helpful nonetheless",
I have used many different task managers over the years on different systems. I have been looking for an app that is a good mix of basic and power-user .  Todoist provides that missing link.  Well done!,
"This is most expensive app I have ever paid for, not sure why it costs so much. I upgraded which allows tasks to have reminders (is that it?)  Clean look and easy to use.",
"Lástima que haya opciones las cuales sólo están disponible para la versión de pago, como agregar comentarios a una tarea. La aplicación funciona de lujo y muy usable",
"Good app, but the interface isn't always intuitive though.",
Best thing about the app is the integration with Google. Widget is the best among the task apps. Great cloud support as well..,
"You can charge a high one time price or a yearly subscription fee, but not both.",
Would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra help with managing multiple projects.,
I really liked the karma feature on the desktop version. Add that in and I'll give 5 stars :),
Very simple and easy to use.  Syncs well across all platforms. Works well on my Android phone and iPad,
"After some trials, Todoist is my choice for its simplicity and elegant. It will be better if all features are released free. :)",
I like the many ways to set due dates and recurring dates,
"Works just fine, only thing is it does not show in the calender.",
Easy to use and helps keep things organized.,
simple things like a way to select all items on a list is not there,
"This app is great, and I especially love the recurring tasks and organization options.",
Helps me keep track of everything I need to do. I've been very busy and this keeps me on track.,
"This app does everything it says it will do, reliably, with a clean design and an unobtrusive reminder system.",
Lets you manage your tasks with projects and labels. Tried allot of task managers and this one is the best.,
"Simply said, a must have To - Do list application.",
I am premium user since 2012. It helped me to improve my organization ability,
So ready to add an manage tasks. Great job. Thank you,
Widget with holo style or adjustable opacity would be nice.  Otherwise its everything i need,
We use it at work and it is great for collaboration! Any tasks people have for one another can be simply added vía a shared project!,
Awesome. But simpler ui should do.,
"More than I expected from this app. Has helped me since recently purchasing my first home, keeping all my to-dos tracked. The ability to pick dates and recurrences help, along with the daily reminders.",
I want to select multiple items and edit them simultaneously. Thanks.,
Very intuitive to use and keeps me focused even away from my computer.  Great part of my workflow.,
The interface and the functionality of the app is very great. Must have to get your things done!,
Great to todo... Great! I just can't justify a monthly fee.,
Powerful but simp!e. I'm sticking with this one from now on.,
Just an amazing app simple with a very clear UI (user interface) for manipulation,
Works really well although the subscription is pricey.,
"Easy, clean, beautiful. Nothing more worth saying.",
Able to stay sync up with wifey on important task and reminders.,
Always where I need it on all my platforms.,
"Intuitive with ease of useability and editing, especially from widget portion. Nice work.",
Very useful. Keeping me sane at the moment. Android app experience good. Easy to use.,
Even has features for working in a team. 5 stars all the way.,
"A very useful app, recoments for all.",
Found one I like better for one time payment of 7$,
It really helps me to organize my works. Thanks.,
"Design and functionality-wise, the best in its class.",
This is a great app.  Only wish it provided a full month view.,
This app and all its add-ons saves me sooo much time!!,
Easy to use and does what it's supposed to. Quickly and efficiently.,
Easy to use app with great web interface. Samsung S5,
I find this app so useful to keep track of how efficient I am! I do recommend it,
"Thanks for app. Really best there. I use it for android, outlook and web. And will take premium...",
"Need to pay to get reminders, ridiculous!",
Easiest best to-do app I've found.,
I love being able to access this wherever I am,
Better if this tool have desktop notifications,
Why should I pay when there are other free apps,
Easy to use and keeps me on track very well,
Wish Premium Unlock was cheaper.,
"More function if you pay, expensive.",
This tool is bringing some order to my days,
Great little app for tracking daily tasks,
Easy and simple to use.,
Highly recommended ...especially for those that are using Outlook,
Really helps me do more.,
Love todoist. Would be good to see karma in the app.,
Help my company keep track everyone task n duedate,
Add some auto indenting for rapidly creating subtasks and it will be almost perfect,
Awesome app... I can easily set my to do list,
This app do the job well for free ! :),
This app is truly a must have.,
This is the best task list on the market!!,
Great app for increasing productivity. Very intuitive.,
"Great app, truly helpful to subscribe.",
Wields like a charm and us smooth.,
By far the best!,
I use this every day works flawlessly.,
Best productivity hack I have ever used.,
As above,

Very useful for daily or weekly plans,
"Simple et efficace, beau travail !",
It is the app I was looking for.,
simply perfect.  Love using it.,
Good tool. Can sync with PC. Helpful.,
"Task list, to do list",
Great app - with browser/tablet/phone support and helps me to add -and more importantly strike off -my to-do list anywhere.. one of the very few apps I've bought . Try it!,
If I could give it a hundred stars I would,
Best ToDo App I've found,
It's a pleasure to use,
Good balance between functionality and simplicity,
For those organization geeks,
A must have application,
Keeps me well orginized,

So much productivity boost.,

"I have been w8ting wunderlist update his services to google calendar integration, gmail and evernote, but with todoist and zapier, i can syncronize all my data at once",
Solid and it works,
"Started using the app a few weeks back and so for its really good. No major issues. Very consistent. Of course a lot of the best features are reserved for the subscriber version. That said. It would be nice to include times for the deadlines for things like work projects that need finished by a specific time. Otherwise, a very good app.",
"Nice, functional task management application. Looks good and is easy to navigate. I'm more than willing to support the dev team, but $30/year is way too much for what is provided in the premium version. Also, I'm shocked I cannot sort my inbox by due date. This is basic functionality IMO.",
"I have tried so many to do list and task management apps. This one hits the right spot between functionality and simplicity. It's beautiful and intuitive, a pleasure to use, has the features I need, but keeps the interface clean and uncluttered. I'm a freelance writer, so I'm using it to track and schedule multiple articles, revisions, queries & pitches, follow-up with clients and editors, and progress on larger projects.",
"If you just want some basic lists, ToDoist will do the job... that's where it ends. As a paid task list or to do manager. It fails on too many levels. Here are a few:  No Sorting: You cannot sort your tasks into due date order. This should be one of the most basic features of any task manager. You are required to use the 7 day view for this functionality, or the web version to order them. But as soon as you add a new task, it goes to the bottom regardless of due date.  Adding Task Dates: Adding due dates to tasks using terminology rather than the date picker is almost impossible. You need to write it in the exact format ToDoist specify, otherwise it won't work. If you want to see this functionality work well, check out Remember The Milk.  Reminders: Sometimes an automatic reminder will be set for a task, sometimes it won't. Even if it is set, it's hit or miss as to whether you will actually get it.  Sub-Tasks: You have to indent tasks to add sub-tasks. This is very unintuitive and means you'll often add sub-tasks in the wrong place.  Summary: Basically it's taken me more time to work around the ToDoist functionality than it's aided me as a task manager.",
Nice app. Good design but the premium model is overpriced. There are to many options to get the same features for free.,
I love to hate this app as I can't stand the cuteness of the interface but it flawlessly sends me email reminders each month for all of my regularly scheduled bills and functions. Requires premium to get that feature. Superb.,
"Switched from any. do, makes my planner look organised and feels sleek, but premium is a tad too much to ask for.",
"There might have been a few things I thought were not optimal or missing, but after a few days of using I found it to be perfect for my needs and more: it makes it easy to improve productivity effortlessly",
"I'm addicted to it. Its a great app . Also you can get other apps to integrate with Gmail, chrome, outlook",
"As a corporate cross platform droid phone and Windows PC user, I needed a solution for my growing projects and tasks. I have used this for a month, and I'm very pleased with it. I have it on my phone, embedded in Outlook, and also use it on the web. I couldn't be happier.",
Switched from any.do because I was blown away by the repeat task customization here. Form and function all around are excellent.,
"Was using Any.Do for my task tracking. Found it a bit hard to keep track of my stuff using any.do with my computer and the phone. Todoist does it much better than any.do and has a better UI than most other applications. Its easy to use, beautiful and fast.",
"I add all my tasks, no matter how small, in Todoist. It's a very good organizer app and I sync it with Google calendar to have a monthly overview of my activities.",
"It helps me organize my task and prioritize them to make the best of each workday.  Know every time I feel lost, I just check my Todoist and I'm back on track. Love the app. Still seeing if the premium model is worth the buck.",
"I could not figure out how to create a new note in Any.do screen...but this, this is simple and great",
"I've tested many apps of productivity, but only Todoist give me the best solutions. Totally integrated with cloud and is present in all my devices. My life is most easy after of Todoist. I wish I could rate with more stars. ;)",
"Does what it says, and does it well. I wish some of the premium features were in the free version...like reminders or labels. But its a reasonable price and they gotta make money somehow and I don't get bothered with ads.",
"I've tried gazillions of apps just to create simple todo lists with possibilities of extended functionality. Reminders, syncing on several devices and reaching from any web browser is a must. (And I really wonder why many of the other apps don't have them) And this app has even more... Give it a shot.",
"Good stuff. Not quite.omni focus, but has task allocation and that's more important",
Very helpful reminding me to get things done A+,
Todoist really helps when it comes to finishing things.,
Very useful to I can check to on my android when I am out of my office. Also can add any time any where perfect,
"Love the features, colour coordinations and ability to add sub tasks, very helpful.",
Awesome. Keeps me motivated and organised at the same time. Syncs with my desktop browser to the app on my phone.,
Totally has changed the game In helping our team juggle our projects,
Works great and easy to use! No problems at all!,
Love it. I'm still on the fence about Premium but I love this app / service!,
"Great app, I am using it since a week and I have already loved it!",
Perfect todo list app and system. Bought the premium version within 4 hours.,
Free version enormously useful in itself.  Simple and efficient way of keeping track of tasks. Love it.,
"Simple to get started, with powerful features you can use as you need them.",
"It's a great, minimal but powerful todo app.",
And I have tried many.,
So far so good.,
Good app..so far the best I cam say.,
No option to skip account setup.,
Ver helpful tool to organize daily tasks.,
Great app  works well for two users,
Nice complement to Evernote. ..use it everyday.,
Good app..only if I could add description of each todo...,
Good product but a few rough edges,
Works great.,
Can't sync Gmail tasks,
"Simple , practical app. Like it .",
Its just what I have been looking for,
Clear Concise A1,
Good but could be great,
Good apps,
It,
Awesome,
Todoist,
"This product has been very helpful in keeping me organized. I use it for work,  school,  housework,  and even grocery lists. I highly recommend it",
Very productive tool. The ability to label and categorize items makes it the best in organizing tasks.,
"Love the concept of inbox, and today, tomorrow, in a week filter",
There is room for improvement but already great as it is.,
Love this app!  Long forward to more improvements,
Very good.,
it is amazing,
"I was skeptical at first, but after taking the leap, I wouldn't go back to any other planning / task management app. Todoist is stable, fast, easy to use, multi-platform and, in its paid version, loaded with great features not available anywhere else (the way tasks can be quickly organized in projects and sub-projects is especially handy).",
"It even has simple project management and multi-level task lists, but I have to use them even for simple shopping list. Definition of recursive tasks is not very intuitive on mobile and not very powerful. Widget uses too much space for a single task, so only couple of tasks are visible. Nicely designed, but not very practical.",
"I was not looking for collaborative Apps, so review is from the perspective of individual use and not for teams. I've tested many todo apps, and they all are OK. But Todoist  just tops them all for me. I love the possibility to capture notes everywhere through the various plugins. Beautiful UI. Labels and filters are perfect for GTD. Great App.",
"This app probably the best to do list app I've encountered on  the play store. It's simple, easy to use, and accessible from just about anywhere on my phone or tablet. The  reason I've given it only give stars is because of the fact that it's not as organized as I'd like it to be. By that I mean, it feels as though every task is under the same subcategory; one  task can't be distinguished from the other.",
"Came over from Any.do app.  This GTD app had absolutely everything I have ever wanted for a to-do/task app. Very minimalistic design which I love and easy to use. I am very happy to support the growth of this app and company. Please also consider making a Calendar App, and Memo/notes app that all syncs together! Good job, team.",
I read all the reviews this seemed the best to do list manager according to most. 12 seconds of input you can just say whatever you need to do and everything is neatly arranged instantly. This will at least triple my own efficiency and return hours and days to my life I will never be without it going forward. A great book on efficacy is getting things done.. And this is exactly what the book describes ...I think you'll love it,
"Brilliant. I've tried a few, but find this has more flexibility and I'd better for GTD than any other to-do apps - especially with web and outlook apps too. Premium isn't cheap, but is worthwhile. One small improvement that would be really great is if the widget had smaller text, so it showed far more items in a small space. Currently it needs to be too big for my home screen, which means they aren't right in front of me as they should be.",
"Downloaded this app the other day after using their web service. No problems sync'ing across devices and there's a widget for it! This is my current favorite productivity app, I've tried others that had a points system but if I missed a day it got all messed up. Todoist shows your overdue tasks as well as whichever view you choose (I usually look at today's tasks). The recurring tasks option is great, most customizable ever. There isn't an option they don't have!",
"The team is very responsive. I reported a bug & within 2 days a patch was pushed. I love trying new to do app but this one is my favorite. Very clean and intelligent ui. I'm subscribing because the notes, reminder, project is worth it. I'm excited to see some new addition to this app.",
"Beautiful interface. Collapsible sub-tasks are a life saver. I use this app to log every single thing I have to do, and ToDoist makes it so easy to stay organized. Premium isn't that expensive compared to similar applications. It is well worth the cost.",
I run the IT Helpdesk at a local software startup. I am basically the only IT staff there on the day to day. I get at least about a 100 helpdesk requests/projects a week. I could not make it through a work day without this powerful little app at my side. It's like having your own executive assistant in your pocket.,
"A superb app and simple to use. i would recommend it especially as it synchronizes on a laptop, brilliant. However, on the phone version it sometimes crashes when turning the phone round and you lose your last note which is annoying.",
"I'm notorious for experimenting with organizational apps. My best friend introduced me to Todoist, and to say the least, it has been the best task management app I've experienced to date. I especially love it for its integration into Google mail and Chrome. Highly recommend it!!!",
"I paid for premium during the sale and now regret it. The app is quite sexy looking on the surface but has too many ui quirks to continue using it. So you have a list of tasks, some are subtasks, some are not. If you drag a regular task you'd expect it to behave the way a lot of apps do and drop it inside a subtask, but this doesn't work that way. Drag a task up into a subtask and it suddenly becomes the parent of that subtask and all the subtasks beneath it. How does that make any sense? When would I ever want to do that? Not to mention there's a long standing bug that when you go to edit a task and change the list it's in, it may or may not actually move. Right now I have two tasks that just live in the next 7 days view, and don't exsist in a list. These are just a couple of user experience bugs that keep me from being able to rely on it as a solution.",
"I just can't justify 30 dollars a year for a task app, even as nice as this one. Sure wish there were notifications on the free version or a cheaper way to unlock them.",
Wish it had time reminders in free version... Just started using it.. Takes a little bit to get used too... Would love to be able to add sub tasks a little easier,
I've tried everything from ever note to wonder list. This app is for people who like to keep things simple and no t get overwhelmed by other complex task management apps.,
It looks good and works as intended. They do however show features only to tell you that you have to pay for them when you select them.,
"Overcomplicated and ""clicky"" app.  Kitchen sink approach to app development cripples utility. Requires separate account.",
Plenty of free features and user friendly. Very pleased using it. Would rank it as excellent if there would be a calendar overview of all coming tasks.,
"Ive used a couple different todo lists and this is BY FAR the best ive seen. Simple, intuitive, and flexible. I love it",
"The best to do list app in the market for now. Sometimes there is a problem with synch, but it is easily solvable by restart.",
"Syncing across all devices, fantastic interface, intuitive and powerful recurring event management, and it's easy to use. Love it. I am a happier person because anything I need to remember to do, I put in the app.",
"I have tried more than 10 applications to manage my jobs. This application is nearly perfect.   Especially, the sync with desktop version and managing subtasks are those what I was looking for.",
"Great app for all those tasks that need doing. Syncs across all my devices (android, iOS and windows).",
"Todoist has everything you need from a to do list and more. It's a clean, simple interface across all platforms. And no ads like some others.",
I really like the layout and that it has sub-categories. Also like that you can list projects separately. Also like that it has an undo option if you check off the wrong thing.,
The free version is awesome the premium I can only image just adds huge value. Will be upgrading.,
"No way to see completed tasks unless I buy the premium version, and even with premium it can't show completed tasks by project/date.  Useless for productivity analysis over time.  Uninstalled.",
This app keeps me on track with my crazy work schedule. I'd be so lost without it.,
"Awesome app. My wife and I use it to keep chores, grocery lists, etc in sync. However, I dinged it one star solely for one reason... You cannot view completed tasks on the app (only on the website).",
"Love the notification drawer quick add option, but hate that the app always opens in the Week view, rather than the list of my choice (Inbox).",
"I have tried a dozen alternatives, and this is definitely the best to do app. Thumbs up for the developers.",
"All around this is a well done list and note app, but there are too many things that try to get the user to buy the premium version.",
I've used todoist on all devices for a while and the only negative is it doesn't actually complete my tasks for me! Brilliant app.,
Went back to Toodledo which was stable and consistent for the last five years. Promises more than it can deliver.,
Good app and service. Please implement improvements to make it 100% great!  - Ability to rearrange labels.  - Access to completed tasks from Android app. - Allow to add 1 quick note when creating new task. - Widget to quickly create voice notes that appear as inbox tasks.,
I've tried many to-do apps and this is by far my best experience: easy to use and with many useful features,
I was looking for something simple and easy to use. It syncs well. I wish I could let the app open in the last list I was in though.,
I've tried several of the to do apps but like this one the best.  I appreciate your good ideas folks.  Keep up the good work!,
Nice interface. Has all the functionality I require including widget. Synces seamlessly. Good stuff!,
I've been looking everywhere for a list like this. All you need is one widget out and you can change the list that displays just by tapping the drop-down list. I adore this app. Love. It. To. Death.,
"I'm feeling this app to the max! It helps me see what tasks  I have days in advance, allows me to check off when completed and make changes when necessary! I'm so grateful for it....thanx u!",
"We can now share lists! Thanks for listening, Devs! Hands down the best to-do application out there.",
I DONT LIKE THIS APP.  IT DOESNT HELP MUCH.,
Todoist has been great for me to track my tasks as I think of them.,
This is the best for collaboration work! But hope to fix the picture size when clicking.,
"I have tried several and this is the best, both in terms of features and UX.",
Love this app! Devs I highly recommend putting a Forecast view like Omnifocus instead of Next 7 Days. Would make this app killer!!!!,
"It's clean and effective, but so limited in the free version that I won't be using it much longer. You can't even view your completed tasks...",
Nice work Todoist team! Please keep up the good work and don't stop constantly improving the app! Cheers!,
"Simple to use, just what I needed to organise things.",
Een gebreide en handige taken manager! Goedkope premium versie. Compitable met al mijn devices,
"I have used many apps so far and found ""Astrid"" as the best one. After using it for an year the company got acquired by Yahoo in Jan 2104 and since then there is no support for Astrid. Again our search continued for a simple txodo list that has collaboration capabilities and cross platform support. Finally got this App and found it very much suitable. Just hope whoever buys this company will continue the support going forward. I congratulate all the developers at Todoist. All the best.",
Has a nice theme that fits in well with the Google apps. Very nice that it is cross-platform.,
Provides one of the most mature ways of organizing and planning I've ever seen.,
Amazing just what I was looking for in a task list. Its a breeze to navigate. Plus the email notifications help too.,
One of the best to do apps I've used... Simple yet meets all beginners and advance user requirements...,
Best app and best price.  I use this more than social media.,
Perfection exactly what I needed minimalistic in design but has all the desired functionality for ease of use. Worth the upgrade,
It just misses a more user friendly interface (Like any.do),
It really does everything I want with a to do list without making it too complicated.,
Love it. Took me time to realize how useful it is!,
ToDoist's wide range of functionality and integration makes it uniquely useful.,
Such as recurring tasks,
Needs real time sync to calendar for star 5.  Great time management tool.,
Helps my productivity massively. Would definitely recommend to others!,
The free edition has more features than the pay edition of Remember the Milk.,
Honestly change my life in a small but significant way.,
Product needs some nice video  tutorial training to make it great but still great product.,
"This is fantastic, great interface and usability.",
Effective cross platform system.,
"Luke the ap, would like to see more color",
"Easy to use and with all you need, no more, no less.",
Love it! It's really helping to organise my days.,
"Works smoothly,  with a well-thought out user interface.",
Simple and helps me keep track of all of my work,
Awesome assistant :). It is best todolist app/software I have used till date. Easy simple interface. Effective.,
It's good.  Keeps me organised,
It's simple minimalistic layout is exactly what I need.,
Really like the way it allows me to organize my projects and assign tasks to each project.,
Looked at a lot of reminders.  This is the best so far.,
Give option to sync with third party open source server for corporate deployment,
Love love love! Saved my life!,
Great way to organize your daily tasks.,
Would like to see completed tasks.,
Tem bastantes funcionalidades e funciona muito bem. Recomendado!,
I hate apps that require you to have an account. This is a to do list app!! why does it have to be so complicated!!!,
"Simple, rich on features, on all platforms,  all the time.",
Simple & easy to use... Nice interface & useful to have.,
Todoist is the perfect solution for my needs!,
Great app with rich features.,
Great tool for managing a busy life!,
nice interface also so simple to use,
Would be nice if you can add time. Amazing,
If it had color codes it would be better.,
Must have business app,
Best ToDo app I know,
So far so good,
Very easy to use,
Works well!,
Works nice and easy.,
Pretty easy.  Multi functions.,
Crucial for my productivity,

"If it was free for the pro version it would get 5 stars,  that being  said even the free version was better than any do.  Any do was great buy I found it to be a little gimmicky.  The pro version is head and shoulders above most other phone to do apps. Plus is integrated into so many different platforms you simply can't go wrong with this app.",
Not at all intuitive.  Very difficult to navigate. Got e-mail with free for a month upgrade. All it did was erase the all from my tablet.  Then I find out the license is the most expensive I have ever seen for a personal mobile app - almonds $36.00 a year. I uninstalled it. I hope they don't,
"Good app, but for its money it has too many bugs and is missing several features. The most important for me and also other users is the reminder features. When pressing the ""Clear Button"" which erases all the notifications on the panel, but also erases the reminders in the todoist app. They should be erased/ modified only when taken a direct action on them.  It becomes very frustrating, since every time I need to create new reminders, instead of keeping the old ones until I take a direct action on them.",
It's more of a collaborative app than a mere task list. Yearly subscription charges makes it very costly application. Further there is no facility to share task list third party apps like emails and WhatsApp etc. I think we can't print the task list also.,
Hundreds of paying members on the online forums have been requesting for over a year; numerous people in their Google play store reviews: Yet updates come and go without any acknowledgment regarding the ability to change to a dark themed widget and interface. The all-white is blinding to many of us checking tomorrow's tasks before bed or those of us who prefer to keep it dark to preserve battery life from a blaring bright screen.,
"Multi platform and all. However, reminders are premium features at $35.99 per year. Too expensive. Astrid was way better, too bad it died.",
Best todo list app in the store so far!,
Performance: precisely as claimed; Usefulness: substantially exceeding expectation.,
"Best task app I have used, almost perfect.",
Очень удобная штука)),
Awesome app!,
Great!,
"Almost perfect. Biggest two complaints are that when you change a shared project's title after other users have accepted am invitation, it doesn't get updated for the other users. AND if you create a hierarchy of tasks and projects, the other, users don't see it. Otherwise, I've been quite happy with Todoist. Switched from wunderlist and way happier.",
Needs more widget customisation options. Otherwise a great to do system.,
"At this point, the only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars, is because I want to color-code the tasks under each project, and have some indication of them visible from the project listing... and easily editable tasks from the app. But those are just icing on a ln already great cake.  Excellent app!",
"I have been using OmniFocus on Mac for years & have been looking for a cross-platform replacement for about as long. I use a modified Getting Things Done (GTD) strategy, and Todoist was able to accommodate my GTD framework (w subtasks) without any challenges. It syncs quickly, looks great, and with pro you can get context labels and email-to-project support. There are a few changes I would make if I were king of the world, but for my money Todoist is far and away the best cross-platform GTD app out there.",
"Easy to use to do list app.  Syncs beautifully across my platforms. I have two things I'd like it to do: it won't do is self promote the next item after I've done a task and the app lacks a clear ""next action"" designation.  I've been using the priorty flags fire this.",
"A good mix of features and easy of use. Plus there is an app for it for just about every platform, even a Chrome plug-in. That being said my Android app tends to fall out of sync and calling the refresh function does little. While I'd love this issue resolved I mainly use it on the Web and pc for work and in that setup it has yet to disappoint.",
"I appreciate the cross platform syncing and also the full Web page access.  I like clean, practical functionality and this app delivers. Now that it's beaten the competition I shall upgrade to the next level. Get organized - get this app.",
"I'm now using a combination of this and Evernote. This one, however, really helps me to get things done and track it solidly. Data tracking, emailing daily progress... I upgraded to premium. Love it.",
"Great flow, fast and powerful. I haven't been able add emails as tasks since my bb days...more persistent reminders would be nice. Adding any file to a task is amazing. Selecting multiple files at a time would be a bonus.",
This is one of the best thing about this app. I can share projects with my team and can track their work flow.  Very user friendly and easy to use.,
No other tools to match this in terms of platforms that it supports.  Cons: paid features are pretty expensive!,
"Fast, easy to use, light. I would have liked to customize the theme and colors, but that is not really important. :)",
So far this is the best todo app I've found. It does the basics well and adds advanced features without over complicating the interface.,
I have been looking for something like this for ages. The latest update offically makes this the best app ever,
Need to add more customization for widget but. No transparent background or color themes to choose from.   Also no proper alarm for time based events.,
"Just wow! Never expected that you can write such a ""simple"" thing as to do list that way, so it helps me. My respect to the developers.",
The fact that if you don't pay you get seriously little out of this app is depressing. Especially since it's not THAT amazing.,
Easy to capture everything that matters to me and even easier to make things happen.,
"Works seamlessly with its cloud backend storage. Never complains about being offline, just syncs when it can and uses screen space well. Brilliant!",
"Such a great app abd concept. From huge projects, to simple tasks, to daily goals, todoist helps you juggle everything you have going on.",
"Best to do app in a while with amazing features even in the free version, thank you for this !  Gonna have the primuim version just to support,  greetings from Saudi Arabia",
This app is good. Suggest the event feature to set up a meeting. And a lower annually fee.,
This is the best app and cloud based task management system that I have tried. I like being able to keep a heirarchy of tasks and projects. I also like how easy it is to move tasks to a different date within the mobile app.,
"After searching any other to-do apps, this is one of the best of to-do apps! Simply Interface, Reminders and Supported in All Platform just perfect, and The Karma feature it makes me challenged to making many/do the to-dos that I'd made. KUDOS for the Creators!",
"Great user interface: very easy to add, edit, check as completed, etc. I also like the option of Today or 7-Day views. The effortless sync across multiple platforms is a huge bonus.",
"I have been using ToDoIst for a couple of months now. It is flexible, easy to use, works across all devices and really helps in managing my tasks. Do use the tutorials to get the most out of it. Very highly recommended.",
Great features to help me keep organized remind me of the vents in emails I need to attend to.,
"Can't say much so far because I've only just started using it. But it really seems to be really thorough & well thought out, plus fairly easy to use & intuitive to set up. I've tried others before, but they never seemed to 'stick', so I'm hoping this app will be a lot better! }^}fingers crossed{^{  ;-) (Samsung Galaxy S4 w/Kit Kat)",
"I've used too many task apps to count. ToDoist is easy to use, powerful, flexible, on all my devices and beautiful. It meets my business and personal needs while keeping me very productive. Excellent product!",
"Great app with a sexy interface.  Easy to navigate, simple to use, but yet sophisticated enough to use for business and personal",
"The author is very responsive. Nicely complemented by desktop plugins for Chrome, Firefox, etc.",
"Syncs seemlesly with all devices, easy to use and understand. Used daily for work and personal life.",
"You can syncronize your todo list with your mobile phone, your pc...good application",
Wish I could view my completed tasks on the app though.,
Best app so far for recording  and monitoring simple tasks.,
Go premium! That's the way to make full use of this~,
Decent but could do with a few more organisation options...i.e. by Labels and priority,
Love it! Keeps me on track and work efficient!,
"Awesome,  I love it! Works great,  helps me remember everything!",
It's basically a list manager.. I have to pay to add notes to a task? There are many free ones around that do better..even a basic Google task can do better..  Want better task manager with Great UI? Any.Do does it well also..,
I have ADD and this app has helped me get organized a,
"Simple, elegant and functional.",
Very usefull organising apps..,
Excellent and simple to use..... multiplatform support gets things done......,
Use it every day!,
Its fun to get things done with TODOIST,
Sends report after completion of a day,
Widget loads a bit slow,
Nice to do list program,
Best application to manage what to do.,
Question though... Were can you see completed tasks?,
Good app,
Too expensive to upgrade,
An excellent app,
Really useful,
Simple and fast,
GREAT app,
Já experimentei vários programas do género e este é o melhor. Em particular gostei muito da integração com o Outlook.,
"Fantastic, clean app for organizing my work flow as a busy grad student. My only gripe is the subscription required to unlock the full version. I'd happily pay a flat fee, but I can't bring myself to subscribe when the basic functions work well enough.",
"Please don't complicate it. Do not over engineer. Keep it lighting fast, ubiquitous and clean. Don't break it - you're by far the best GTD solution out there. # update to new version: problemas syncing with server. Most items do not get synced and have to keep uninstalling and installing the app in order to correct them.",
"I like it, but it's frustrating that you can't appear to look back at your completed tasks.   When I'm done with a bunch of stuff I'd like to see that stuff crossed out, not just disappear forever.  A ""Remove completed tasks"" option should be available for permanent removal.  I apologize in advance if these features exist and I just can't find them.",
"I used Astrid religiously until Yahoo! decided to discontinue the service, I spent about three months trying out other GTD apps and this is by far the best one out there. All its missing is the ability to time tasks and log how long a certain task or project took. Other than that, this app is dank.",
"I really appreciate the todoist whole of services (not only the app, it would be too limited to consider only the app though it's kinda perfect). I used then free period then I purchased the premium without hesitation,  it's very cheap if you consider the perfection and the clever details. We need more services like that, congratulations to the team",
"I use Todoist on all my PC, tablet and phone.   The Android app is excellent, easy to use and just about the right amount of alerts to make the app useful rather than annoying.  It's a lot more than a To Do list.  I fully recommend you trying this system.",
"I'd like to try the Premium features but to upgrade you have to pay for a full year. Unfortunately I'm unwilling to take that much of a hit. Let me know when you offer a monthly Premium upgrade option and we'll go from there. For now, thanks but no thanks. App deleted.",
"Todoist has been an integral part of my life for the past year. It helps me keep things straight between work and personal tasks. The app is an essential piece of the pie. It's had some growing pains, but has evolved into an elegant, thoughtful tool. Keep it up!",
"A really useful tool for keeping life under control!  I would really like the ability when you view a project to view all the tasks in all the sub projects too, like the web app.  Also more ability to use colour i.e. highlighting whole tasks/projects in colours rather than the little bars of colour at the moment would be great!  But otherwise, awesome app!",
"I love Todoist very much and use this service every day. The app is great - nice looking and convenient. Synchronization also works fluently. The only thing that I miss is reminders. I would like to have possibility to snooze reminders for a chosen time, to be reminded about the task later.",
"As soon as I saw that reminders are a premium feature I gave up on this app. I don't mind paying for an app that's truly useful, but if very basic functionality is locked away then it's not even with my time to try it out.",
"On the web page interface, completed items in a Project can be left visible, but on the Mobile app they are invisible.  Is there a way to keep them visible but marked completed, like on the Web version? Would be nice to have them there for reference or in case they are accidentally marked completed (no way to undo with going back to a desktop computer).  If so, would warrant a higher rating and pro membership.",
"After Astrid dropped support I picked up Wunderlist for it's cross platform availability. Somehow I came across Todoist and I can confidently say it beats any to do list I've used thus far. Clean, simple, and helps me get things down and ultimately done! Download this app right now!",
"I bought the premium subscription before I realized that completed tasks could not be viewed or undone (on Android).  People have been pleading for this essential feature for 18 months; the response was to provide a window to tap ""undo"".  In addition, checkboxes do not appear on task lists to tick off completed tasks.  They are present on the web version, not Android.  I'm disappointed - - but I've been using the app for a few weeks, and it hasn't killed me.  Still better than most.",
"I've tried multiple GTD type apps over the past 3 years. Todoist is among the easiest to use and I love the multiplatform support - - Nobody works in a simple homogeneous environment anymore.   What does it need? 1. the ability to have todoist-gmail-plugin like functionality while using my mobile phone client (I use Gmail client on Android) - - thus allowing the creation of tasks linked to emails,  directly from my smartphone. 2. A simple feature on the phone app to conduct guided daily reviews.",
"The user interface is nice and clean, but the usability is not there. I have been using Check It Off Pro for a while and despite its shortcomings is more usable. For example, adding sub-tasks is just weird in Todoist. The check mark icon is used for both saving and completing tasks, depending on which screen. Notes and labels are paid for features? That takes away from the appeal to stick with the free app. The usability takes away from the appeal to buy the app. I think I'll switch to Evernote instead.",
"My main complaint is with the reminder and notification system on the Android app. First, the default reminder setting should be at the deadline. Then, the reminders should be persistent. Any.Do has a first class notification system that todoist would do well to look at.   If todoist can make links to gmail emails on the Android app I would be ecstatic.",
"Cannot state how much I love this. App is easy to use and I LOVE the seamless integration into gmail/chrome. That alone has made this my new favorite organizational tool. And believe me, that's saying something.",
"This is clearly an excellent app. Chalked full of features that actually increase your productivity and makes your taks and completed items highly visible.  I also use the outlook extension for Microsoft office. TREMENDOUS! you can seamlessly add an email as a task. I will likely upgrade to premium for that very reason.   The free version still can't be beat either. Everything is so easy, no need to enter additional menus to assign dates priorities, all nicely ajex quick items with default times. Excellent!",
"The free version is easy to use and helpful.  Since my memory isn't worth the paper it's printed on, I like being able to note things down as they occur to me.  I don't know what the pay version is like.",
"I've played about with several Android task managers: Wunderlist, Any.Do, Astrid, Doit.im, IQtell and many more. Each of them does a different particular thing very well, even better than Todoist.  Where these systems each have a feature that is exceptional, they fall short in other areas. Having now paid for the Pro version of Todoist, I now have a tool that does EVERYTHING well and reliably, even if it doesn't 'wow' me all the time.",
"Nice interface, appropriately uncluttered, supports 5 levels of sub-tasks, collapsible when viewed, plus 1 more level if you use Projects as parent items. Longer text notes are only available in the paid version, but I might pay for that if I don't find any other free app that offers them on top of the same simplicity and usability. One thing I'd like to have that's clearly missing is a way to keep some private notes hidden and password-protected somewhere (e.g. in a hidden Project that doesn't show unless you enable it from Settings and that can't be opened unless you enter your Todoist account password again).",
"Once task are marked, they disappear into oblivion.  No option to retrieve them,  unless you log on web.   Would need an option to see them, even done, to keep a record,  even on app,  for a meeting as an example.   Marking tasks as wip would be great!   1-3 states of task completion, as :    1) Waiting for internal review 2) Waiting for client approval 3) Final delivery  Some glicht in synchronisation between web and app.   Web app is better than android app. Evernote makes a better job integrating accross",
"This app is useful easy and does what it promises, worthwhile to try and benefit from.  Only the upgrade seems to be a bottleneck. It come at an annual price and not a one time license cost and that too is expensive.   The basic features are good and fairly sufficient.",
"Pretty good app, but missing some little things:  - I want to see always my tasks sorted by due date, and manually I can do it, but no way to set default sorting and every time I reopen the app, its sorted by other way (I guess order of entry). Its super-annoying as I need to reorder manually in each task group separately!",
It syncs with my laptop and phone and never lets me forget pending things.. Karma thing is really nice to get you going,
Good tool. Web & android  simple yet powerful. Subtasks makes it good for detail task list next action list. Lack of labels for free versions is a big drawback as there are other free tools available.,
"Mobile and desktop and mail clients  and browsers. You can vote on site for what will be developed next. Clean and smooth. Simple fortunately. Doesn't try to manage your whole life, karma for completed achievements. Fun to use.",
"Features available in free version are quite solid; I most especially like being able to have sub-tasks and sub-projects. Being able to access my lists from mobile devices and the web is crucial for me, and the fact that they stay synchronized without a fee is a huge help.  It isn't without its flaws: creating sub-tasks can sometimes take some work, and making a standalone task a sub-task isn't exactly intuitive. But all in all, it's a stable app that works rather w well.  I will more than likely be purchasing premium subscription to service, based on my experience.",
"I have been struggling to keep up with my tasks and always missed the deadlines. This tool is really helping me out to stay focused, organized and be productive. A must have to for anyone who has to be pro active and perform above expectations.",
"I could not imagine tracking my projects or general life to do's without Todoist anymore. It works so well across my devices, including the chrome plugin. A must have app.",
A great app for staying organized.  Simple to add tasks and prioritize.  Love ability to add subtasks which is missing in other apps.,
Very useful. Reminds you every day. Bugs me at times  like a wife but well worth it,
"This app really help me to focus on my tasks and help manage projects too. With its collaborative function, I can get feedback from team members. It's really practical and rewarding.",
"Still working out the best way to GTD this, but so far itcsuits me far better than anything else.",
I am really enjoying this app. It has helped me focus and become better at prioritizing my day. I am getting so much more done.,
$30 and not even full version forever? This app could be excellent if it cost $1.50 with notes and reminder. Online backup can be extra feature for those who care... To pay $30 every year for todo app is bad business model. Uninstalling becouse this stripped bersion is not usable.,
Free version doesn't allow you to set reminders for specific times or do recurring tasks.,
"Great free app, looks good and easy to use. The premium version has some useful features and I'd buy it if it wasnt ridiculously expensive",
"I want something digital that is as easy to use as pen and paper. I like the idea of digital to do lists, but I don't want to spend half an hour a day organizing them. Maybe I should buy a Samsung Note.",
"This app helped me finally get organised! It has just about every feature you need (other than file attachments for my phone...) plus many you didn't know you did need!  Don't worry about trying anything else, you've found it!",
"Beautifully organised task list, excellent sync features. My to do list at all places. Never forget something important",
"Missing recurrent task, need to import tasks  from other sw like gantt, or similar for instance with xml format",
"Simple across all my devices/machines. Works perfectly, although I can live without the karma piece but you can turn that off. I know how OCD I am!",
"I'll update for 5 stars once that's implemented. This app is really helpful, but sorting is necessary.",
Haven't gone Premium yet but this is an excellent tool that syncs between all my devices. Truly top notch.,
"I'm on the go between 2 offices and out in the field.  I need a system which I can refer to at any location that contains the same up - to - the - minute information.  Sometimes I access or update on one of my 2 office Macs, my Android Tablet or my Samsung Note.  The features are what I need with multi platform access can't be beat",
"Has everything I need: reminders, labels,  tasks and subtasks. The design is pretty clean and has apps for every device.",
Need to get premium to get most features at outrageous price. Doesn't have a timed reminder system or any in phone reminders.,
"totally recommended to organize ur task. liked the cozy friendly interface and that's it's linked and can be integrated with ur desktop, ur phone and ur messy outlook. the only issue is that i had to pay to get the full package of features but really it's worth the price",
Like the idea it works across many platforms and it versatility.   Would like to see the ability to add video and audio notes to tasks ...,
"Simple, nice and good. Todoist running all platform, and the support is really good. Recommended app. Use premium for more feature!",
"As a business owner, I've been able to stay on task and remember to do those small tasks that I'm always forgetting or putting off until later. Definitely helps!",
"Simple, quick, good at what it does without a ton of features that are not being used anyway. Plus the web app is also excellent so you can use it on desktops too.",
"Great, intuitive app for managing and collaborating,  but I would like more functionality to the widget.",
This is the best to do app I have used so far.  Great UI and available on all my devices. Well done. Looking forward to more improvements.,
I've tried them all and todoist beats them all for simplicity and ease of use.,
"With support for multiple platforms, sweet integration with Gmail, realtime synchronization, just to mention a few, once you taste Todoist, you ain't switching to any other ToDo app. Trust me",
"Just the right settings and tools you need. Also the ""karma"" rewarding system does give extra motivation to add just about anything to your list in order to gather karma, which keeps you going and making you productive.",
"I've tried many others and since Astrid, this is the best I've found so far.",
Went premium as its the best way to get the most out of this product. Super GTD friendly and easy to use.,
"I not only use this app for to do lists, but also for grocery lists and any other kind of list I need to keep track of. It is awesome.",
"The app and service makes it easy to list, manage, and get my projects and tasks done. The notification and reminders work great to keep me on task.  Simple interface, but powerful results. The Karma number keeps me coming to see my score is getting higher.",
I'm using Todoist along with Any.do and Wunderlist. They all seem comparable. It's really your preference in choosing your favorite.,
"I use this app to organize my entire life from remembering movies I want to see, to blog post ideas, to what I need to get done in a day. The Premium service is totally worth the money. Plus it's great to support companies that are making awesome products!",
"The smooth interface, clean design, and accessibility through multiple devices makes Todoist one of the few tools that hold up to their promise of simplifying my life.",
"This app is amazing. First of all, it is on every platform imagined. I have it on my android, iPad and Windows7 workstation. Everything syncs perfectly. I highly recommend it if you need a organized to do app.",
Task completion stats through karma feature missing on iPad :( also would have been nice of app was optimised for ipad. other than that the app has some great features such as email or text message reminders. Daily summaries emailed to you.,
I clicked Refresh from top right menu. It is not synchronizing with Todoist Web. This issue occurs on my Samsung Note 8 and Sony Acro S.,
I have several projects going on at the same time.  This app keeps me organized.  Easy to use.,
"I've been using Todoist for a month or two now and have to say, it is by far the best experience I've had with an app that claims to organize your day as efficiently as possible. Definitely recommended.",
Using this app has made me more efficient as each day I receive an email reminding me of my tasks and appointments. I also get a notification in my status bar. When I want to add an item I just pull down my notification screen and type it in.Thanks Todoist!,
I am using the free version. For basic tracking of tasks it is more then enough.  Easy to use. Allows you to schedule time with tasks along with priority.,
"Does everything I need and its all quick to navigate, which makes all the difference of being a useful list app or crap.",
I've tried them all. And nothing is as organized and efficient as this app. Sleek and intuitive on every device. This is brilliant.,
Todoist is missing a few nice features in it's free version that Wunderlist has but the overall speed design and organization helps me get things done faster.,
Very versatile yet l would love to see further refinement towards workflow manager.  It easily exceeds most requirements for task management.,
Una aplicación con una función sencilla y múltiples herramientas para hacerla funcional. No es Asana pero le he encontrado mayor gusto por su facilidad de uso y fácil curva de aprendizaje.,
"I use Todoist on my Android smartphone, iPad, and PC. I can stay organized wherever I am, and can stay productive across all platforms.  I realize the tasks marked Done are viewable on the PC/web version, but I can't wait for it to be included in the mobile apps.",
"Seriously, I compete with myself to get more karma for doing work. I extended it to home and my muscles started growing inexplicably. Cannot recommended enough.",
"Todoist is a nice product, but the lack of a start date on tasks is a major deficiency.",
Simply put. One of the most productive apps on my phone. Love the ability to ask tasks directly from gmail with the gmail extension.,
Tried many and found this to be the best for my needs east present. Missing a few features but generally very good,
"I absolutely love the Todoist app - I use it on Android, Ubuntu, iOS and Win7, and all versions are tremendously well designed.",
Very easy to use. Helps keep you focused and motivated. If you are honest with yourself when you allocate priorities you reduce the danger of getting bogged down in displacement activities.,
"With everything I do in my personal and professional life, todoist keeps me and my group focused on what we're doing. Even if you have to stop mid task, just leave a note so you can hop right back in. Cheers Todoist!",
"It's the to do list I always wanted. Love the included widget, too! And it syncs with the Web interface.",
"simple, powerfull &  very usefull apps. i like it being able to create subs catagory, insert comment and add people to it. excellent!",
This app provides the useful functions to organise and schedule tasks. I find it very effective for managing university deadlines! Thank you ☺,
"Great layout, intuitive interface, and syncs across multiple platforms for free. You can't beat it.",
This app has exceeded my expectations and has set a new standard for GTD work flow. Feature packed and allowed me access to test the Premium version for 30 days free of charge.  ToDoist is my favorite tool for my job as a Provisioning Coordinator.,
"Todoist is really in depth and performs brilliantly across all platforms. The premium is also very good value for what you get, and even the free version has a lot of features. Can't fault it.",
"I've tried many different task organizing apps, and this one works the way I want it to. My favorite by far.",
"I'm a premium user and I love todoist. Have it installed everywhere and rely on it to keep my sanity and my business going. I use it for absolutely everything, from keeping track of my deadlines and project completion, to scheduling house chores, to ideas for blog posts and so much more.",
"I've been exploring the todoist ecosystem and it looks like it does what I need, and does it well :) However, I have multiple projects as sub-projects of a ""work"" project and the app isn't able to show an overview of all my ""work"" tasks at once like on the web and desktop versions  :( with that it'll be perfect!",
Love this app. Well worth paying for the upgrade.  Don't know what I have done with out it,
"Keeps me organized and keeps me on my toes. If you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail",
"Easily accessible, syncs to the Cloud, fast to use, and both intuitive and flexible. Wasn't hard to make the decision to go pro.",
I love this app! Every update has been great and made it even better. Perfect for organizing lots of lists and keeping track of multiple priorities. It is the only app I tried that was better than my little notebooks.  I've been using it for over a year both personally and at work.,
Simple and cross-platform support is really good.  Going for subscription model for paid services is what I didn't like.,
"Fast, clean UI, rich with features. Would like to be able to assign tasks outside of a project.",
This is a good app with a clean interface to organize and prioritize tasks. A few extra features would make it better for time management (like better exporting options and synching tasks with calendar events).,
Thus software completely rocks my world. Best Outlook integrated tool on the market!,
Very happy that I found such thing to use :),
Just started using this. I've been looking for this app all of my life. Already considering using the paid option,
Great tool to remind a busy  mom what she needs to do.,
I really enjoy being able to use it across so many different platforms. Very useful.,
I'm loving the free version.  I can add/review items on any device.,
Great task management app.  Not only can I use GTD but multiple platfotms are supported.,
Wish my old palm treo still worked,
Use this on Chrome browser. Desktop application. And now smartphone. All work together seamlessly,
Intuitive and everywhere. I can't say enough good things about this app!,
"Integrates with Outlook, works on Android and iPad seamlessly. Collaborative app because of the sharing functionality.",
This app has been a lifesaver. Coming in to a new job I wanted making sure that I am on top of every little job todoist certainly helped,
"Excellent app (sure as premium) but can't find the todoist karma feature, please add it.",
Syncs across all my devices and desktops.  Allows categorization by projects and labels which let's me use GTD concepts.  Hasn't failed me once since I started using this in December 2012.,
I love it! I find it better than Any do or others out there. Lots of features and very intuitive.,
I'm nuts about to do tracking and organization. Ive literally tried everything. This wins by a good margin.,
U can learn and do som basic things you wont do gy head,
Overall works well too bad the  subscription is expensive,
Really neat to-do app that let's you separate into projects and share tasks easily.,
"Todoist is hands down the best free to do list manager I have ever used. The interface is intuitive, simple, and pleasant  to look at both on the Web and through their app. Being able to track my productivity has encouraged me to be more productive! And not to mention that you get all of this without having to pay for premium!",
Brings undone tasks to your notice in a way that will make you to take action towards finishing them,
"Well thought out, easier to use than other systems, comprehensive integration including with Gmail, Chrome, Outlook.",
It's a wonderful app that helps keep you on track by emailing and reminding you of your list.,
"Very handy little app to track to do lists. I use it on phone, tablet and laptop.",
"Worth the money I paid. Syncs perfectly between my phone, tablet and PC.",
Nice app helps me a lot but hate the point of not getting reminders and have to pay for month and years..,
Very useful and easy to use. No need to be carrying around a notepad with to-do lists anymore.,
One additional feature for Android version is the lock/passcode. With it i would say it is complete.,
The best app I've tried for todo lists specially how all platforms apps are synchronized,
Why do I have to signup for an account or sign in to even use this application?  All I want is a stand alone to-do list manager.,
Great app works great wiWwwth outlook and it will even talk to evernote with an app called zapier,
Very use full application for Business peoples. Easy to use and desktop app also ver nice,
I have tried several task managers and this by far the best one.  Recommend upgrading to the premium version.,
Worth splashing a few box for extra features,
The perfect balance between ease of use and advanced capabilities.  Highly recommended.,
The premium plan is definitely worth paying for. I love this app!,
Is there a way of storing completed tasks for future review including time stamps to check whether a task was completed on time?,
It can be better if they used similar gesture as Mailbox.,
"Have sampled various to-do apps, this is the most suitable to me",
"Closest I've come to a stable Astrid replacement, and then some!",
"I love the functionality of this app!!! It's what I've been looking for all my android life. Its feature that allows you to add a task from the notification bar is king and the organization and aesthetics are wonderful. Most is true even if you don't pay for it. There is an option for premium, but you would know if they were features you needed. The only one I needed was the color codes labels. My only suggestion would be to maybe give a way to set a transparency level on the widget. Thank you!",
Hands down best to do app I have found.,
I've tried a number of cross  platform todo list. This one is the best,
"Simple, efficient and elegant. What else is there to say",
I highly recommend it to anyone that is task oriented.,
Helps me organise my life.  Better than Google Task Organiser.,
Love it. Use it at home and at work. Great basic functionality across all my devices,
"Would love a dark skinned widget, but really good app",
This is all you need from a to do list and reminder app. Highly recommended.,
Sharing projects and to-do lists works quite well.,
An absolutely fantastic app. Really helping me organise my uni work.,
Very practical + user friendly. Does everything I need.,
I just wish that if it has a  better look visually.,
First task list that actualy works for me :),
Simply the best organizer I've ever found for me and my team.,
I am using this application since 2 years. It is awesome.,
Improved my productivity three fold. Love the cross platform apps.,
I am a woman of lists and this app is perfect for it. Very happy with the way it functions.,
$30 a year is too steep.. looks good though,
"Simple, clean and practical these three words are the jewel of this app",
It's a great app. Wish app will show karma ratings as well,
Awesome app that helps you push and stretch to get more productivity out of yourself.,
Everything you could possibly want and More!,
"Simple and intuitive app, I improve my efficiency with this app, I already recommended it to my friends",
Love this app! Easy to use and keeps me on track.,
"Access on multiple platforms. Clean interface, simple yet does the job. Awesome app...",
I have used this app for a long time,
Exactly what I have been looking for in a todo list app! Totally worth the premium subscription!,
Love the flexible due dates (eg. Every 4 days),
"This app makes your Todo's easy to schedule, easy to see.",
Love how easy it is to share a folder with someone,
Love it lost without it,
Reminders can be a little unreliable sometimes.,
School | Engineering,
Great tool to help me better manage my task in an efficient way,
"Does what it says, easy to use.",
"Nice ,simple and keeps track of my progress. Keep it up.",
One advice ... there are only max 5 task on widget.. which leaves some free space at bottom of no use... make it 7.,
Makes planning and organising simple!,
I'd give it 5 stars if it's total free,
very workwell and helpful for me and my team &lt;3,
Couldn't do with out it.,
A great product.  Very good tagging and sharing.,
So to distinguish the tasks,
Easy.  Intuitive.  Integrates across all of my platforms.,
Love it for its simplicity and elegance. Daily planner is what I wished for and I got that from it.,
Well worth giving this app a go,
"Smooth sync, good api , many usefull features",
It appears this will work for me.,
Nice and easy to use with everything clear and uncluttered.,
Does what it says - easy to use & functional,
First productivity app that I'm using consistently,
Like it for its non-complicated look and execution,
Brilliant app indeed.  Keep up the good work.,

Helps me keep on top of tasks,
A very good planner,
Nags me until I do it,
Awesome way to share tasks with others.,
It's better if can sort tasks,
Great for business and personal use.,
Can't access from web or chrome. Couldn't download even the windows app. Website is also down.,
"Great app, it's 4 only for one reason: missing a 'most have' feature of 'move missing call to task'. This exists in Any.do and its a great feature. Beside that - great job!",
"App good, but need a reasonably priced subscription.  Maybe $10/year.",
A handy and effective simple app.,
What a great feature,
Use it everyday.  Widget is very useful,
"Nice apps , very helpfull and easy to use",
The app compliments the entire system,
Great Gmail integration and Android app,
It just works well,

Cool app to manage your work,
Best after evernote,
Daily email feature is good,
Fantastic app! I highly recommend!,
Best app to keep our team on  track.,
Tasks appear on your calendar. Luv it!!,
It's probably the best cross platform todo app... One downside is it's paid... I personally don't mind paying for something that's worth paying for.... And this is.,
I don't know how I ever managed without this app!!!,
Quick and very easy to use.,
The best to-do-list out there,
It works great  with Gmail.,
Very helpful!  Bonus: quick and easy to use!,
Очень удобное и эстетически приятное приложение.,

"Latest version on LG G2 KitKat hangs when completing task, then slows down the phone until restarted.  Have also had persistent issues where the widget doesn't update at all.",
"A great app in some ways but I find the entry of dates and times too complicated. It's a great idea but I often spend longer reading how to set something like a repeat up than actually doing it.  Allow the free text entry by all means but give us some proper controls too. Update: having just spent 5 minutes trying to get a repeat to work every 28 days at 11am, but getting one for 23:59, I give up. I've cancelled my subscription and uninstalled the app. I have more productive ways of wasting time.",
I had tried several To Do apps and was using Astrid for over a year until it was discontinued. Then I discovered Todoist and I love it! It meets all my needs and I'd super easy to use. I like the option of adding to do items by email. I also like it's reminder feature.,
"Tried any.do, wunderlist, and others. In the end, this is the only one that had all the features and felt clean and snappy.",
Great app and the synchronisation between platforms is superb.  Sometimes though this app falls short for the most simple things such as being unable to view completed tasks.,
"The app does almost everything the website can do. It's fast, reliable, and easy on the eyes.",
"This is a well thought out app. Works on every device I need it to (laptop, Android phone/tablet). Features are plentiful and useful. You'll do well to use this.",
One of the best to do apps out there. Worth the $30 bucks for premium,
Switched from Wunderlist. This is a million times better with no sync issues at all!,
Needs a button for see all. Yes I know I can search for VA but I want a button. Also viewing completed jobs is premium? Seriously? Anydo does it free. Give me a reason to stay.,
"Supposed to be the best, doesn't have the simplest feature - won't let you set up weekly reminders!!!!",
The best to do app hands down!,

"I've been using this app for about 6 months, and have come to depend on it daily.  There are some occasional bugs and quirks, like new tasks that show up as due two days ago, but the developers usually have them fixed quickly.  I especially like the availability on any platform, either through the app, chrome extension, or web page.",
"This is the to do app I went with, after searching the play store thin for just the right app.  I have ADHD, and this app helped me a lot with getting simple and demanding tasks done, mostly due to the highly customizable recurring tasks. Sadly I have to uninstall the app when my premium trial expires, because $30 for a year use, is a bit too steep for me, and the notification reminder is crucial for me to get things done.  So I'll get another to do app, while I wait for for a discount in the $15-20 area.",
I was a heavy user of any.do for a long time but then came to find it very lacking. Have tried many productivity apps and TODOIST reigns on top with powerful productivity features and ways to organize your life. I highly recommending upgrading to pro. Well worth it for those who take productivity seriously :) keep it up TODOIST,
"-I could easily add my reminders from Evernote that allows to hop right back to the Evernote page -reminders were not a premium offer -$30/subscription is way too high.   -I could add location based reminders. -Outlook integration is a huge plus to me, an",
"This is simply the best to do app out all the ones I have tried. It syncs across multiple devices (desktops included), has a beautiful design, is feature packed and works great.    I wasn't sure about premium at first, but I received one month free premium and I can say it's definitely worth it. Projects and labels have come in real handy already. Highly recommended.",
"I've tried all of the better task apps. This is best for my needs. Free version should include notes. Paid version is too expensive and should offer Goals to be added for each project. I would have purchased it if it were $4.99 or maybe even $9.99, but not at the yearly price of 30 bucks. A lot of potential in this product. I look forward to seeing how it matures.",
"At first I was going to entitle my review ""amazing"" or ""life-changing"" or something of the like, but I'm just not one for cliche titles like that (though it's true).  I'm a long-time practicer of the GTD methodology and lifestyle, and I have a myriad  devices with just as many operating systems. Todoist covers them all, simply and with good taste and great workflow.",
"I am not a big to do list person, but I do like to be able to make a list here and there. I also like to be able to make shopping list. This app has been great for both uses, looks great and is very intuitive.  The best part of the app is the ability to share. Allowing people to add to list and see list easily, make this the best app I have used to date to track To Dos.",
"if the widget on my acer s300 wouldn't look that awful - it would be 5 stars. And no one did anything all this time with the widget. At least on my phone it is very bad..shows me like at max 3 tasks and takes too much space... But it's really good besides that. But widget is a killer point for an android app like this. It is no add,but i retrurned to any..do. cause its widget works pretty good. I would love to use your app as it has more features i like if u'd change your bad widget some day (hopefully). And maybe on your phones works ok - i do not know that",
"I really do like this app since it is so much more than just a to do list. It is a planner. Be it a work project or gardening, this app makes planning, goal setting and doing easy. And it looks nice. Though the full version is expensive, which is why I will keep on looking for an equally nice app for planning.",
"There is a group of people who want to be organised but due to being super???lazy? ok lazy, something very rude should constantly bug them, and bug them like check your to-do and tell me what to do. Review all tasks in the morning or evening something like ""any moment"" from ""I don't name"". I like to use Todoist specially due to its desktop app on Mac but unfortunately that feature I explained has been the only thing that during the last 15 years made me write, review and organize my to-dos. Max snooze for that feature is 1 hour and you don't dare to dismiss it cause of that conscience .....so it just comes back for all tasks since morning till you do it once for that day! I know a lot of people who this has been the only thing working on them!",
It would take a severe amount of indiscretion to drop nearly 30 dollars on an upgrade per year. I do not use an app if there is no potential to upgrade to the full suite of features. There are many similar appealing options.,
"For small screen estate, the widget can only display few task resulting vast unused space underside. Font needed to be reduced, scrolling need to be allowed; isn't widget means to provide quick glance and quick add? For the main application itself, the design is superb, the usability is awesome. I like it.",
"I've tried other apps, but they all either don't have the features I'm looking for or are clunky and difficult to use. Todoist is extremely intuitive and can accomplish everything I need it to.",
"This app is clearly made to make money off of. Even the most basic features of a to do list app require you to purchase a subscription for $30 a year. Even a one time charge of $30 is outrageously expensive. Without premium, this app is about as useful as a basic free notepad app. Even reminders and notifications are premium only. And I'd honestly give this app 0 stars if I could. The developer needs to change the $30 per year charge to something way more reasonable, like $5 one time purchase.",
"Excellent project based task management app... Unfortunately, the tasks disappear immediately after completion, so there's no option for the task owner to see the updates on the completed ones. Will consider changing the rating and purchasing the app if this is looked into.",
Now I hardly even use calendar.  I especially like that I can use natural language to enter reminders and label tasks.,
"Todoist is simple. It helps you when you need it, then it gets out of your way so you can get things done. Fast entries. Free features.",
It would be perfect if it would allow me to upload a pic or voice note from my phone as a task.,
"No way to easily see tasks past 7 days. Other than that, one of the most useful apps I've used so far, enough that I'd forgive the omission. Well designed, well planned, and well executed.",
"I especially like the feature to share projects with other people.   I don't like that some useful features, like reminders, are only available in the premium version. But all in all the most important features are contained in the free version.",
Its not worth paying $30 a year for a premium version. There's a lot of other cheaper or even free apps that would have the same features or even better.,
"I like this app but it does have one issue: every time I restart my phone, my task widget disappears from the home screen and I have to replace it...",
The UI can be streamlined a bit to make it perfect esp around setting up due times and snooze like Any.do,
"Simple, helpful, and provides an easy display of weekly tasks. Great to avoid those little paper reminders all over :-)",
"But one thing i would like would be to put the number of hours for a task and for it to show the end date from today, or vice versa. It would be perfect if i could do this.",
It's a decent app but pro shouldn't be a  subscription. There are better apps that do way more for free.,
"Have used several, including TD, but have always defaulted to Google Tasks. But this recent ToDoist is worth the leap, intuitive, works with you, and motivates.",
Would like to see some outlook  integration  but all in a the best app.   Use this.,
"Seems to be no way to add recurring tasks, a bit of an iffy problem to be honest.   Everything else is perfect though.",
I've tried a few to do list apps but this is my favorite. I like the interface and find the karma productivity feature motivating.,
The most suitable cross platform To Do app. Helps me with my GTD.,
"This is a really nice app. But really disappointed that the basic ""label and reminder"" features are premium features.",
"Great application to organize your work, home, and education projects and tasks.  Easy to use and works flawlessly in Outlook and on your smartphone.",
"I use it everyday. It does the simple things well, with loads of extra great bits chucked in too.",
"Adding tasks is simple and it gives you a notification to look at it every day, really good for students (me) so they can write down homework assignments and check them off as they get completed.",
"Easy and quick. Intuitive, user friendly interface on my laptop and phone. Excellent app and worth the $29 pet year.",
"Helped me stay more organized, lots of great features, but lacking desktop notifications if you use it on a PC. Even so, made me switch from Wunderlist",
This is one of the bests on its caregory. I installed almost 10 apps on my phone to evaluate and in the end just kept Todoist. It's simple and straightforward. The downside is its widget. It's huge but can barely fit 4 tasks at once. I also would like to be able to specify the task requester. Keep up the good work.,
This app is perfect. It is simple to use and tasks can be segmented into projects in the free version. I love the fact that I can pull up my to do list on my samsung phone or my iPad or my PC computer.,
"I have it on my smartphone, my tablet, and in gmail and it works well across all. Nesting tasks correctly is sometimes a pain but other than that I can't complain.",
"Nice user interface (compare to  web version of the Google task), but like the others have mentioned, the free version it's too limited and the premium is too expensive, also it doesn't let you import from Google task.. I will stick with the free GTask app for now..",
Integrates well with a plethora of platforms including Outlook. This app also comes with the most useful widget of all the todo list managers (and I've tried many).,
"When the price comes down, 5 stars for sure.",
"I use this across my browsers and my phone for work, and it performs beautifully. I've used most of the others, but this task manager has been the best.",
"I use this every day at work. Great way to keep on top of all my projects, both personal and work related.  The service keeps being updated and made way better.  Love this app.",
"Great features, great sync, unreal number of apps for different platforms. The only todo app ill ever need",
I really enjoy having this app. Very good to remind me as I started to note all I need to do every day.,
Try this one first.  It will save you time.  Looked and tested all of the task type apps.  Fast support responses.  Great upgrades.  Would buy shares in this company if I could.,
I have some memory issues and need to have an easy to use system to keep me organized. Todoist has excellent organization tools to keep me on track.,
This app is the best I've found for task management. It's great it can be used from any device and from my PM as well.,
I get lots done just by setting my daily intentions. The free version is more than adequate for most people.,
"Google keep, Evernote just didn't do it for me. I tried some of the popular to do lists like remember the milk but this just fits what I want. Simple yet full features that don't get in the way. Chrome extensions and android support are awesome. Purchased premium. Thanks!",
The only app with outlook add in so I can add emails as links to the to do list.,
"Still early days yet, but I have found the ToDoist app to positively impact my.personal  organisation and productivity.",
"App is lovely well designed, it does what it says how ever it too expensive for a planner",
"Light theme hard on my eyes, especially with fluorescent lighting (yeah I'm old). Otherwise a useful task list. Handy that it can install into outlook, thunderbird",
"I've tried just about every major to do app out there and Todoist is at the top of the list. Clean design, multi-platform support, and flawless sync. The app is super fast and very intuitive.",
My wife and I use it for all kinds of things. From grocery lists to building a nursery and anything in between that requires collaboration.,
"Likely my single favorite app. The integration across all platforms and ease of use, clean interface has made me actually enjoy using todo lists...  And I'm much more productive as a result.",
Clean interface. Integrates well with many platforms. Still trying the free version. The paid version seems a bit pricey.,
"Amazing multiplatform task and project management tool. Couldn't live without it! (PC, Samsung phone, nexus tab)",
"Doesn't seem to sync with the chrome extension, but is a well designed app",
Currently migrating the whole team of a luxury construction company into this platform and things have begun to get done faster.,
"I find the syncing across all devices very useful,  among other great features!",
"the discontinued Planner8 software.  Today, tomorrow and next 7 days forecast is a winner.",
Would recommend the only thing that could be better is the widget.,
It's easy to set up reminders to repeat every day and gives fun messages when I've completed everything!,
I love Any.do. Great features! I have bought allot on Google play but I don't think this to do list deserves almost $200 a year!!,
"Thank you for the free ""premium"" trial! Your thoughtfulness has paid off, unlike many other apps that make you pay to try. After the trial,  I payed for the subscription without hesitation. I have tried Anydo, Wunderlist, rememberthemilk, Gtasks, and many more. This one is the best. - Support team answers questions quickly!   Cross-platform UI is amazing. I use it on my phone, tablet, browser, gmail, and computer.  This app has everything I have been looking for in a task management app.",
Great task mgr to share with Co - workers. Good functionality even with the free version.,
Just started to use this app and finding it easy to use.,
Easy to use and works keeping me up to date with things,
Able to manage and accomplish all task efficiently.,
Super useful app. It really helps me stay organized!,
Tried lots of task trackers. This one does the job.,
I can now feel organized with my work. Like this app.,
Great for planning your schedule. Actually holds you accountable!!!,
"My productivity increased  tenfold, i.m much more organised since i downloaded this app",
Very good app used pc version for long time now,
Todoist + Pomodoro Method = a productive day.,
Would be 5 stars but i think the cost of premium is a bit steep.,
Thanks for a great app: beautiful and intuitive,
But I will never pay for a subscription for any app.,
Please add a dark theme and transparency control for the widget,
"Use it everyday, helps me keep organised and track projects",
Works smoothly across different platforms,
Synching across devices is fantastic and with the Outlook plug this is almost indispensable,
Very convenient and fast. The sync option is flawless.,
A very clean and simple productivity app with loads of features.,
"Easy to use, well integrated. And it looks good.",
", would be good to be able to see previous tasks completed",
Reminders every morning sets up the day.,
After all i found my App,
The best to do list ever,
works well and easy to use,
This app help me so much,
Thanks,
I think it's the best app,
"fantastic, best note ever, must try",
Useful for work and keeping track,
Awesome,
truly an app increasing effeciency of work...i love the simple UI and UX...,
Everyday reminder that works perfectly!,
Design is simple and user friendly,
Free version is to limited and a subscription.... 30 bucks a year. To much for me.,
Use everyday love it,
I love this app,
Like the simplicity and effectiveness.,
Easy to use.,
To add a reminder you need to upgrade to premium. Ridiculous.,
It's the best to do list app.,
Отличное приложение. Все работает как часы. Купил премиум и вообще забот не знаю. Спасибо разработчикам.,
Thank you.,
I'm in love.,
Awesome app. Keeps you on the ball!!!,
Recommended for students. 😊,
Works well.,
Excellent.,
Fast access,
Very useful,
Like it.,
Simply the best todo app,
Fast to use,
Unbelievably flawless,

"I am loving this app. I sprang for the full version and I haven't looked back since. I have tried dozens of todo applications and this is one of the best. Others are crowded and complicated. This is smooth to use, isn't too crowded and syncs to all my devices. It looks great on both tablets and phones and has all the support I need to get my lists down and on to the next task. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a productivity boost.",
"It's nice to have a todo list that works with me rather me having to ""put up"" with a todo list like other apps that were a bit too heavy to use. Todoist is easy to use. I find myself using it from my laptop, my phone, my tablet. There are a few minor things like I want to be able to review all completed tasks on my phone, but I was told that was already in the works. I can do it from my laptop though. I tried several of the popular to do list apps and researched a lot before I finally settled on todoist.",
"I am looking for a web-based to-do list but this is not the one. I found it extremely difficult to use, both from my phone and the internet. I couldn't get it to repeat tasks (why not just have a button for it???) and when I finally did get it to repeat, it kept changing the dates and times. Frustrating! I'm removing!",
"I tried pretty much every one that had a trial or free and this one rocks!  Easiest to use,  very intuitive,  and even at free has the best features.  I upgraded to premium because I'm an organizational mess,  and being able to make notes on my cryptic to-dos was key for me.  I think the price is fair.  Only quibble -  please,  please bring back dark option for background -  much easier on my eyes... Pretty please?  Thanks for a great app!",
"My life style was totally changed, because of this application. Now I can easily manage everything in my life without any mistake.",
ToDoist is a great to-do list program! The only feature I'd love to see added is the ability to set start and due dates for tasks so they stay on my to-do list for multiple days without becoming overdue and slipping to a past day.,
I loved the trial for the full version.  But the membership price is a lttle steep. There are other apps out there that do all that of the premium but for free so I doubt I will contine once my trial time is up,
"by providing you with tools to do so. Even with basic functionality, todoist is incredibly useful, but as you start using more functionality, you'll learn to be a productivity pro by focusing only on the important things.",
It doesn't even allow you to set a specific time to be reminded and if you want to try that capability you have to subscribe for $30/yr. Deleted!,
"Even just free version, this apps is easiest to use to manage the task, the UI design is really simple. Nice apps",
1. A bit too tedious for my liking on a fingers only device like S3 2.Too costly for premium; not enough features to make free stand out,
"I would like a couple of extra features, such as some way of sharing with evernote but generally a well thought out system.",
Am trying the free version to test it out. This app has a super-sleek look and great function for a free service!,
"Great, clean interface that is smooth across all platforms. The 'Projects' functionality is wonderful, especially the ability to tier.",
"I use this for work- will add 30+ tasks per day.  Easy interface, simple and fast!",
"I tried a few apps to keep track of my to dos. This was the most user friendly.  Plus,  I like the notifications.",
Great UI and functuonality. I love how east it is to use and how I can categorize them through making projects. This helped me a lot. Thanks!,
"A brilliant App that sits on my pc, iPad & android phone. I can quickly add tasks as they pop into my head. Supports a GTD approach that has made a huge improvement in my productivity. Highly recommend.",
:-),
"This app allow my team to easily plan projects, track the progress of tasks and make some discussion on todoist. However, the layout, especially at the 7-day-view, could be improved.",
What an nonsense apps. Boring and waste. Never ever download.,
"This app is great, helps me to stay organized & get things done, you gotta get the app, you will enjoy it.",
I use todoist on my laptop all the time and this apps a great way to have the list on the go.,
already update  this app for 7x time. lol.,
Helps organizing my tasks by project.  A big lifesaver!,
"5 stars, Thanks for fixed issues",
The seamless integration let's me become more efficient!,
I would definitely buy it if the sync with Google Calendars were real time!,
"Links all my gadgets, lets me rest at night.",
"I am very happy with this app, it does what it says it does.",
I can manage my tasks in my work and my life.,
Great for project management.  Upgraded to premium.  Very happy with it being on the cloud.,
Love this app.  Helps me stay organized.,
"Please, add feature to share completed task",
Great app to keep track of tasks. Does exactly what it says,
Great collaboration features.   Fast yet thorough.,
This app save a a lot of time...,
Great tool to manage yourself and your time.,
Good organisational tool.,
Very helpful to keep me organized,
I like the clean and simple UX.,
Thanks,
Насколько простое настолько и функциональное и  фундаментальное приложение. Необходимо всем.,
Great app,
Interesting so far,
Works perfectly,
Great,

"Finally an app that keeps my Android Moto X, Windows PC and iPad synchronized with Outlook. Wherever I am I've got what I need within my reach.",
Does just about what you need it to,
Too expensive for what it offers,
,
,
"The cross platform and website capability make this a very useful program. I would like an option to keep the completed items, crossed out, on the project views.  That feature would help out during periodic project discussions.  The display of the date and time of completion is also handy to rebuild a project timeline. I bought the premium a few days after installing the free app. Thanks for making a good product.",
I've been trying to find a to do list app that accommodated repeatable tasks on different number of days. Most apps out there well give you a set list. My only complaint is that the tasks repeat via due date instead of completion date.,
"It does absolutely everything you'd expect a to-do app to do. It's clean and organized, and the free version is plenty perfect for people with light to medium to-do lists.   The only thing I'd ask for is an improved widget. It would be better if you could customize the transparency to match other widgets or be able to see the desktop.",
"I hate doing reviews but I absolutely love this app and the todoist website.   For the first time I feel as though I have a better handle on all my projects.  Organizing home projects, gathering documents and resources for my doctorate dissertation,  and completing daily tasks has become much easier.   Thank you todoist!",
"I've used various task management software. They range in size from able to handle large 20 person teams, to just small, personal projects. My previous favorite was Workflowy for it's simple, tree structure. ToDoist takes that simple design and adds so much functionality without cluttering the interface. I purchased the premium a year ago and couldn't be happier.",
"I've used so many different to-do apps. Each had strengths and weaknesses, but Todoist combines all the features I want in an app and then some. Asana dogs hotkeys and speed right, but their Android app and collaboration sucked. Wunderlist got simplicity down but was so slow and unreliable.",
"Things I really like: drag and drop tasks into a natural order; subtasks; priorities; natural language dates. Also like project view. And the support videos eg David Allen. I do like the product's name too - quirky!  I'd like it not to show unnecessary info on task eg Inbox, Date. Or maybe a Setting to have the option. I get lots of tasks and when using it on my mobile, there seems to be a lot of wasted space. It would make evaluating and moving tasks around easier. Maybe also could reduce the font size.",
"I started using tablets with the original Ipad and as a result got really spoilt when it comes to some of the more niche or business related apps.  I am in the market for a tasks related app which has the same functionality as Awesome Note.  categories, Calender, Reminders and most importantly Gtasks Sync (this is a dealbreaker for me).  Finally it should have a beautiful interface  and be available for a reasonable 1 time only fee.  I installed this on my nexus 7 and it looks OK.... however at the moment it does not sync with gtasks.  Looking at the forums and support this is a feature that has been requested over and over again and the developers appear to be ignoring it.  If you do not have a task list currently running anywhere else and are starting from scratch then this is fine.  if you already have a Gtasks list then you will need to consider whether you want to spend your time reentering your task list from scratch.",
"Please add support for:  Time based reminders (2pm on date x)  Reminder recurrence  Ability to add new label from the assign label drop down. It's there when there are no labels, but after first label you have to go to main screen",
"Its like sending you a reminder of what list of task you have inputed. But once it is accomplished, your list will be erased (of course). it will be more appreciative if you are able to repeat a certain list of job on a different date. Like for example monthly bill payments every 25th of the month.",
"Great if you just wanted a text list Syncer, Anything else and you have to shell out upto 30 $ a year or whatever it is for the Pro account,  Pretty useless.  imho Not recommended for free users.  RTM provides much better functionality and it's completely free.  You cannot do GTD @ Contexts without a paid account Cannot even add labels.  Sorry, gave it a try.. but Uninstalling.",
"Edit: Please add support to export list to Pebble okthxbye!  After using it for a day, I prefer this over Wunderlist, now that we can have collaboration with others. Also the comment feature is extremely nice. I like it a lot!   I just wish the price is a bit cheaper, might be OK for the Americans but for other countries, it's a bit pricey especially after conversion 😢",
"I found Todoist totally by accident. So far it has worked a bit like MS Project and I love you can dissect tasks up to 3 levels. It also syncs across every single device I have, which is awesome.",
"I love this app, I also like the I idea of puting everything on line.  I've tryed most if not all apps from google play nothing and I do mean nothing comes remotly close to this app. With the million of users they aren't wrong  Grate work guys keep it up!  The days of pen and paper are Gone! Or almost.  Don't take my word for it, download the app you will glad you did. I wish I found this app years ago! I don't give out 5 stars ever! this app goes beyound 10 stars",
"I've tried other similar apps. So far, this one fits me the best. Easy to use. Good widget for quickly adding new tasks. To my surprise, I like the Karma feature.  Works well with s-pen on Samsung Galaxy Note 3. My sticky notes are moving off my desk and into my phone. Seriously considering the Premium version ... even though the price is much more than I've ever paid for any app!",
"I love Todoist! I used to scrawl my to-do list on scrap paper, but would end up losing them! Now with this app and all it's plugins across all the platforms you can think of, I can take my list wherever I go! Epic! From a usability perspective, my only gripe is that you can't recall completed tasks.",
Unistalling right now...  We would have to pay 28.99 for one year to be able to set a reminder for a rask.,
I like the simplicity of this app. I would like a few more controls for displaying the lists. There is too much unused space; I would prefer to get more data into the eyespan.,
I use the app on my phone and tablet. Plus I use the Gmail extension on Chrome. Everything gets synced quickly and effortlessly. Pretty smooth interface.,
"I used to be an Astrid user, and since it closed down I've tried and disliked several todo list apps.  todoist finally changed that on me, I have no idea how I didn't find this app sooner.  I love having access from phone app and desktop browsers, sharing lists with friends, and the sync appears to be outstanding.  Not only does this replace Astrid, I think it's even better.",
"This is an almost perfect task management solution. Having used Any.do and Google Keep in the past I have moved to todoist and haven't looked back. Might consider the premium version, if only to support the devs.",
I migrated from a paper to-do list years ago when digital became more convenient but have never been able to find a suitable replacement until ToDoist.  I tried many phone apps and computer apps over the past few years but could not find anything that did it all well. I was looking for a way to sync Outlook to my Android and the 3rd party apps I was trying to use when I came across ToDoist. Tried it - loved it - bought it. Is it more expensive? Sure. Is it worth the extra expense? Absolutely!  I feel like I have come home. It works!!,
"I love this app and decided to use it, but when i try to make some task for TODAY.. it will automatically switch to tomorrow in a few second.. i think its a bug.. can you fix it? Or what shoul i do",
"Neat, simple design. I especially like the options for projects and priority. The karma is definitely a nice touch.",
Only sad that premium cost took so long to find - accepted that the free trial is a good idea it would be more upfront to state cost earlier.,
"Fantastic app, it does one thing and it does it really well and looks good to boot.  I just wish the premium version wasn't so expensive",
Simple to use and simple ismy friend.  Nudges me when something isn't completed.  Outstanding ability to access and use on multiple platforms.,
We've only been using Todoist for a short while but it's quickly become a vital app in our team. Chrome plugin is perfect for making tasks and I love being able to assign tasks to people from my Android phone. Out of all the To Do apps I've tested this one is here to stay.,
Thoughtfully allows you to organize task groups into projects. Great for project management. I can breathe so much easier now,
"Absolutely the best To-do list app available. Sync between fellow workers, Thunderbird, and any PC.",
"$28 annually to enable push notifications!? Seriously!? I can expect push notifications from lesser evolved apps. This is one of the most feature rich productivity apps with a clean UX that I've seen to date the irony, however, is that the lack of push notifications for reminders makes it quite counter productive.",
"Ever since my massive concussion, I use apps like these to remind me of everything I forget. So basically everything.",
Simple user interface. Helps to avoid clutter on my calendar thanx,
It helps with my organisation I'm always forgetting thing but this app help me through dad to day tasks,
The new UI is straightforward and way to use.  It would be 5 stars but on occasion it duplicates or deletes my projects after I create them.,
Only problem I had was that it took some time to get used to manage different projects.  Would be nice to see what tasks finished in time and where late. After finishing the project.,
"Very smart, slick, easy to use, great customer support, tied together with all my devices.  The best that I've found.",
wish I found this ages ago. I have an Acquired Brain Injury and staying on top of things is a nightmare. simple interface. easy to read. hooked into Outlook. on my android. wow.,
Great looking clean UI. Simple reminder App unless you'd like the extras.  Wouldn't pay yearly subscription though ✌,
"Really appreciate the developer for giving a few version.. Also looking to purchase this great app.. Must have app guys,  those who schedule your day on and out of your work place",
"Ned to improve on editing of proj dependent and dependency and relationahip, a wee bit cubersome...",
One thing that is missing is the ability to display completed tasks. Very useful so far.,
"It's a to do list, but these reviews are raving on about how it's changed their lives. Obviously fake, I'm sure the app itself works fine though",
"I work in the Marketing Department for the University of Houston-Victoria and I depend on Todoist to keep my work organized, manageable and simple. I really enjoy it very much as my go to task manager. Thank you to the Todoist team for doing such a GREAT job with updates and features for Todoist.",
"Labels, filters, notes, reminders, sharing. These features need to be available as a limited time trial as the way they work is essential in choosing a to do list app. As it is, there are better free and trial apps with all the features.",
This app is good stuff. Free version has all you need. Pro version is great for folks who want to get really detailed.,
This app works as advertised.   It allows me to quickly add items to my to do list and group those items into projects.   It's a great way to keep yourself organized.   There are extensions for Outlook and Firefox as well.  It's fantastic!,
"A great utility, well laid out and easy to use.  Rich in functionality and consistent interface across devices.  Pleasure to use the app, hence a very practical tool to boost efficiency.",
"Excellent app - clean UI, quick to add new item and easy to focus on those tasks that are urgent now.",
This is useless without a reminder. Too many fake reviews.,
"Todoist helps to be on the track of your activities. Planning is vital for execution, one can use Todoist to guide you to next level. Worth it!",
"You want to add a task, it does that with at most perfection and effectiveness. Good user interface and does what it is meant to do.",
Chose this over Any.do and Wunderlist. Just suited me better and does everything I need it to (and with style).,
Doesnt support mailnesia for those who don't want to get their spam email.,
I use todoist as a simple task list. The interface looks nice and is easy to use. I find it very helpful!,
It's absolutely amazing and useful BUT the paid options make me look for other apps.,
"Please show me things I have completed! Preferably at the bottom of the list with a strike through them. Otherwise, nice work. Sharing is a breeze but a little hard to find at first.",
Even without paying for it this app is awesome. It's so easy and quick to add tasks.,
Gets productivity high as I can prioritize my work and not forget things to do...,
This is a great app! It's simple and fast but has a lot of good features. I suggest using it along with the desktop client which has great keyboard shortcuts.,
"I like that I can use it on mobile and desktop, unlike many other to do apps.",
I've tried lots of to do list apps and this is by far the best. It's really easy to set deadlines and the widget makes it even more accessible. You can edit a note or just it's deadline right from the widget.,
Love this app. Have tried all the other to do list apps and this has all the features.  Love the Gmail plugin.,
Paying almost thirty dollars a year for a task list app is a waste of money when you can find free ones with similar features in the app store.,
I find it very useful to track my task. With reminder and easy interface. No complain sofar.,
"An app that has given my business improved enthusiasm, productivity and hopefully profit. Thanks heaps",
Does what I want - simple shared task list on android and web.,
Free version doesnt have reminder option.. waste of time. And money for installation. .,
A simple to use To Do task manager that allows easy access on various devices and the web.,
"It is a task manager to offer a fully integrated HTML5 experience, it is useful, fast and easy to use,try it",
"Works just as great on Android as it does on iOS, desktop, and the web.",
I love all the options for widgets. And as far as I'm concerned it functions fine.,
"I already have this app in my PC. it seem Ok, and I like it. so I installed it in my phone. But I can't log in from my Phone. It keep asking me to check my email and password, and try again. So it bothered me.",
"Full featured flexible app that let's me tailor it any way I want to better manage my tasks. Mobile, tablet,  multiple Windows machines and Outlook integration too. What's not to like?!",
... on the desktop integration  with Outlook and it started auto sending my draft emails.  Nuts!,
"This has been an incredibly helpful app for my husband and I to coordinate chores,  vacation prep,  and all manner of projects.  We've tried several apps and this has everything we were looking for,  and more!",
Please give time 2 instal application first then ask for rating..,
"Классное приложение) Радует, что приложение регулярно обновляется и шероховатости устраняются)",
It needs to much more detail oriented & advanced.,
Memory like an elephant.,
Nice. .  like this apps. In our daily fast life it's very useful to me,
It became easy on my daily task both in work and at home.,
"Noe that they've added project sharing this is my go to ""to do"" app",
"Love the recent redesign and new features, especially on desktop.",
I keep being pleasantly surprised as I discover new features and I become more comfortable with the program.,
"Fast and easy to use,  this task manager works with no hassle.",
Helps keeps me updated and accountable to what I have planned.,
I have tried SEVERAL productivity apps since the last 12 years (remember the days of the palm pilot?) And this is the best by far. Nothing comes close.,
Would be great if users can customize the theme.,
"App of genius simplicity, yet smooth and crisp task design.",
Best to do list app I've ever used,
Enjoying month of premium giving me better feel for app,
Need to make the base product complete in functions. Love the subtasks n project functions.,
Suggest to have search option for the done activities,
"Streamlined and sharp, really missing dark theme option though",
Makes managing those commitments so much easier,
Like all the features but would like a dark theme,
I love it but it could go much farther but 4 stars is still top notch,
I needed to move off Outlook tasks and this was exactly what I needed.,
Awesome way to keep track of day 2 day activities,
"Good app, I really like it, help me a lot on my daily basis",
Really handy for getting things done!,
Numerically or alphabetically is a must. Please do this.,
Really like it.  Best I have found.,
The app for mobile devices doesn't work as good as the desktop one...,
I like the fact that I can easily sync my list across and its quite simple to work from,
U make my life to be more organised!,
Why must it get into my email account,
Finaly found perfect todo list app,
It's a great product. Thanks,
It helps a lot to arrange d work.,
"Out of all the task list apps out there, this is my all time favorite.. and ive tried many... so if ur looking for an aop that does everything, this is it.",
Well made. Simply well made!,
I loved to use this app.,
My favorite productivity app Never has any problems Fast and efficient Layout is nice and clean Can sort using different layers or priorities,
Gets the job done and easy to use,
Best task app ever,
Extremely simple nd classy UI,
Task Master app for Android,
Very bed Experience .,
A nice and useful little app,
Nice one to plan,
Super tool,

El hecho de sincronizar con calendarios bajados de Google Play es muy útil. Una aplicación bien pulida y que sigue mejorando. Cuando necesité ayuda online me atendieron rápida y amablemente (chat en inglés).,

"It is pretty good, better than remember the milk, because RTM has a lot of features that make it unusable (don't go in this direction please)  Todoist improved two things I didn't like. Now they won my 5 stars :)  Things they improved: 1. Postpone behavior for yesterday tasks 2. copy and paste the last ""what's new"" description for new updates.",
"I wouldnt call it perfect, but it does what it needs to do to keep things organized. Consider buying",
"App functions well. Have had some problems with the web client as of late, hence the 4 stars as I view their entire ecosystem as one app.",
Great to-do app. I use the Chrome plugin on my laptop and the Nokia app on my phone and it's all linked together. This app continues to get better too.,
For a very long time I've been looking for a to-do app that can organize my homework properly. This app is perfect - it is so simple and beautiful. Its widget works and looks great.,
I am a huge procrastinator who ever would have thought that adding a simple point system to accomplishing tasks would get me on track. Maybe I'm a simpleton but it works great for me.,
"This app has made huge progress since last summer, am now using it as my daily driver. Very quick to enter tasks, which is a must. I just wish the widget had a somewhat dark transparent background, if at all possible.",
This is exactly the to do list app you are looking for. Easy move tasks to the naxt day by sliding them down the list. Easy to mark complete by sliding the task off the side.,
"Great tool. Loving my 1 month premium upgrade. I have a few requirements through; task dependencies and subtasks within inbox. Other than that, fab overall tool.",
To do lists have never been so good!,
"I love it, but recurring tasks are missing, or at least I've not found how to set them.",
Clean interface. Cross platform ability is convenient. Very happy with ease of use.,
Not amazing features tho ok app!,
Organized my life.  Love it.  Thanks guys!,
Love it I keep all my running list in todoist.,
Works perfectly across all my devices,
This is a great app.. i love it.. although a few improvements are still needed...,
I like the reminders :),
Good for manage task,
Gut,
I wish it integrated with the calendar more than it does.  In my perfect world anytime my calendar has a hole in it my todo list should slot in a todo item with the highest priority. The tyranny of the urgent and the distractions of normal office life easily reduces productivity... when my calendar and todo list work together then my time management is likely to be more effective and productive.,
"I'm really enjoying it. I almost tried everyone GTD application out in the market. Lot of them has potential to be the best. However, this one seems to be the best. I would like to see some feature in the mobile version though. First a visual representation of all my task in addition to list that is available. Second, a pop up of jobs reminder. Third, Karma map in the mobile version. Keep the good job going.",
"I like the apps design. Very disappointed to find out after paying for premium to add additional functionality most of it is not available from the app despite it saying usable across all platforms. Developer was willing to refund me but since I can't find receipt from Google play I'm stuck with it. Rather hefty price tag considering (unless I'm missing something) all it added was ability to add tags, receive reminders, and allow creation of projects. Can't even access completed items from app.",
Used to be right into GTD but always had trouble making it seamless between pc and mobile. This isn't quite as powerful as some of the programs I've used in the past but it's UI is much more pleasant and the user friendly and obviously it has an android app that works perfectly; which is usually the weakest link of web-based solutions. The premium licence is quite expensive but still considering it just to get the most out of an already very usable app.,
"User interface is simple and useful. For me it is the  best Android option, beating out Wunderlist and Zendone based on overall ease of use and feature set. I hope it continues to grow in functionality to come closer to some features of Omnifocus, such as specific ""snooze""   times and location-based notifications.",
"Only thing keeping me from giving it the fifth star is that i can't view my completed tasks in the app. I can go to the web site to see them, but I really need to be able to see them in the app.  Otherwise it's been fantastic using this app/service. Highly recommended.",
"I'm a GTD nerd who recently gave up the Mac-only Things app, which I loved. l had to tweak a few things, but am pretty happy with the switch. Todoist helps me stay on top of my projects & tasks, which is exactly what I need it to do.",
"I just started a new job and have 10-15 priorities related to on-going projects and a few tasks that are one-and-done. Because the app is on my phone and in my gmail, I am able to purge my mind of all ""oh I should get to that soon"" tasks that constantly distract me and cut my productivity. Todoist has been awesome for helping me keep organized - everywhere and all the time! I would love to upgrade but my job is with Americorps so a one time $10 cost is about all my budget can handle. Thank you everyone at Todoist!",
"Okay, I have tried, bought & upgraded 30 to do list managers. Up to now I had always found the managers either too complicated or too simple.   These developers are geniuses! Simple design and lots of thought  have created a beautiful interface, that is simple to pick up, and learn.  But the true genius is how flexible the app is, allowing me to create task lists for my most complex project.  Integration with Gmail is AWESOME! One click and my task is created and linked back to the email message.  Best ever",
"I've been using Todoist on and off for almost 10 years online. I switched to Todoodle for awhile, but the efficient simplicity of Todoist brought me back a few years ago and I love it. The Android app amplifies that. With hashtag capabilities and the folder structure, I'm able to divide my work load according to clients, location and type. The new version allows you to quickly prioritize according to date and postpone a task to tomorrow or even next week with one button.  One of the best!",
"The good: Clean user interface.  Intuitive. Integrates with a Google account.  The bad: No support for recurring tasks (Remind me to change my furnace filter every 3 months, and set the next due date 3 months after I've actually done the task) $29/year to ""upgrade""?   It's not even a one-time fee.  It's recurring.  Put more effort on recurring tasks and less effort on recurring bills.",
"Best simple time manager I have used. Currently on my Android phone, iPhone, iPad and desktop. Sync seems to work very well. Haven't tried the collaboration yet. If that works well I will subscribe.",
"I have been looking for such a perfect tasking application for a long time, I tried many before, but now I can say I found it. Thank you todoist.",
"In my humble opinion even more functional than rtm or any do. Love the new planning feature. Needs a ""no date option too""",
Convinced my non-technical wife to use it to organize our tasks. Works great and going premium very soon.,
I posted last night about a serious issue I had with the app even after redownloading it yesterday. By this morning the developers had replied and an update was released which fixed my issue. That's responsive customer service.,
"Excellent app. The widget is very convenient for quick task lookup. Adding new tasks and projects is a breeze and cross platform support is great. All in all, one of the best task management apps out there.",
Adding a to-do the app creates a replica so it looks like you have two of the same. Not great really.,
Good functions but not all the required features work unless one become a paid member.,
Can't say enough. I use this across all my devices to manage my day and jobs.,
Shifted from wunderlist. so far so good,
Better than a great many apps/solutions focused on a similar market space.,
Enjoy using on a day to day basis.,
Great app!,
Website + app combo makes it extremely accessible and easy to use.,
Excellent way to keep focused. Works across all platforms.,
I still miss Astrid but this is the best replacement I have come across,
Use it every day works great,
Fantastic tool for getting things done and feeling great about it!,
"Great app, keeps me on top of things",
"Good app, with nice features",
Works really good.,
Good app!,
Awesome!,
Manage your project easier,
Very handy,
Very good looking and simple,
Nice and simple,
Life changer,
Simple and concise,
Helpful,
Brilliant,
I've used just about every To-do app available for Android and Todoist is by far the best and most feature complete.,
*Update. Thanks for the info! Todoist Rocks!,
"The interface is very simple which is the best thing for a to-do task list app. What I like about it is its sync ability. My Chrome, my laptop, my tablet, my phone have the list anywhere I go. This is what tasklist app I have been searching for especially for a person like me who always forget things. Its sync app helped me to have my tasklist anywhere I go even if I didnt bring my tablet.",
"I really love todist. However, it is too much when basic features  like reminder costs 29usd per year.   Top to-do apps such as Any.do and Wunderlist include features such as note and reminder for free.   Some suggests I hope todoist can adopt are making the premium cheaper or making reminders free.",
It's helped me slowly add different reminders and get more organized.  Stuff that I need to do a month or year from now I can add and it won't clutter my list and overwhelm me with irrelevant tasks. Organization by project and then by tag has also been a lifesaver.,
"I had a long review written about how annoying it is that it costs $29 to get the feature of adding notes to tasks, but I now realize that the app doesn't even work. I edit a task to change it's priority or due date, and my changes are undone right before my eyes. Very frustrating!!",
"You have to upgrade to the paid/premium version in order to use even the most simple/common features - such as labels and reminders..  really?  ToDoist has a nice GUI, but it lacks basic/essential functionality.  There are far more capable task/to-do list apps available on the Play Store, for free.  So unless you want to pay to get access to features that the competition offers for free, I suggest you look elsewhere.",
I've been using it for a week now. I love the integration with Outlook. It does wonders for me keeping tabs on important emails through the night. Like that it both syncs with my phone app and outlook. The ease of use is great and it has all the features I need for both personal and work. Thank you for an amazing app!,
"I have to be able to set tasks to recur at sometimes odd intervals. Very few apps allow this. Todoist not only has recurring tasks, but allows sharing and categorizing. The comments feature is great as well. My family's new go to todo app.",
"I downloaded this app because it looked like it would be a great way for me to set myself some daily tasks to complete. But when I entered a task, it automatically listed it twice. If I tried deleting one of the doubles, they both disappeared. At first I thought it might be a glitch from adding it from the widget, so I opened the app and tried from there ... same problem. This is useless to me, I don't want a to-do list that's bogged down with doubles of everything. Uninstalling.",
This is speedy on my phone. Really helps me focus on getting things done at the right time. Also love the statistics.,
I do most of my work with the main website.  This app is perfect for quickly writing things down as they pop in my head throughout the day.,
"Kept leaving to try other productivity apps but always come back to Todoist	I've been back and forth to all the other major players like toodledo and nirvanahq but I always feel good when I am using todoist. The updates I see are fantastic.",
Even I have money still 22 Euros per Year is not justified. Uninstall because of this Trash policy to gather money once,
"My productivity has shot through the roof,in part, because of this app. The premium version is worth the money for the integration options.",
"Don't understand why my tasks appear twice. When I try to delete on, both of the get deleted.",
It did work fine until the last update.  You can no longer drag and drop the order of items.  Uninstalled and reinstalled and it still would not work.  Going to uninstall and find something that actually works.,
I've synced my phone and computer and I can add tasks from anywhere. The interface is clean and easy to use and had great features.,
"For the way I think, the best way to organise my chores.  Projects,  subprojects,  tasks,  and Subtasks cutting the todos into manageable portions.",
I would like to request for reminders on the web page. That's all.  Support is very responsive and helps to solve issues rather fast.,
"Not working offline on Windows, uninstalling. The guys are obviously stuck with their beloved HTML5 and too lazy to write a fast, native Windows client.",
The best to do list out there. Would be nice to have an easier interface for putting time specifics though. Perhaps slightly too expensive for premium but very good otherwise,
"Flexible, does what you want  and need it to do. Sync with all your devices.  Needs to add windows phone app as I am switching to a windows phone.  I'll be waiting.",
"Beautifully designed, this task manager is powerful enough to manage task lists for multiple projects across teams and simple enough for your shopping list.",
"Most helpful is Todoist's cloud integration. I can manage appointments and attach related files and in an instant, have them on my Android, Mac and iPad.",
"*Update*: Sharing is now implemented, along with a few subtle improvements to task entry. The best Todo list manager, just got better.  Flexibility and power where needed, simplicity every where else.  Manages tasks, and does it well.  All features intuitively implemented, including powerful repeat rules and filtering. The latest versions continue to improve on the already strong foundation.",
My only complaint is I wish you could go back and see completed tasks.,
Love this app. Keeps all my trades and deficiency lists organized.,
"It's an app, it has a nice ui and great features, but I don't see why it has an expensive price premium. ""any.Do"" app can do the same thing and more.",
"Of all the to do softwares I have used this is the best next to Omnifocus for implementing GTD,",
"A very flexible and well thought out app and I tried them all. The only one which is always there when I need it. Browser, Phone, Computer. Well thought out feature list, simple fast task entry.",
"A few features I would like - ability to set start dates as well as due dates for example. However, the app is easy to use and words great across devices. Best I've tried.",
"This app will not even remind you to complete tasks unless you pay $29/yr. I'm not against paying for apps, but that's ridiculous. There are so many alternatives that will send you notifications for free.",
to pity that so many options are locked for premium. main feature is note that locked but useful,
"Switched from any.do. present in more platforms, interface makes more sense, I can do by project, even in the free version. Works for me.",
One of few products that is better in its mobile experience than the native desktop one!,
I use it on a daily basis and I haven't gotten any problems with the app,
when adding a subtask it is always being added to the same task... no possibility to choose the task to which you want to add it... nor  is there a way to move a subtask from one task to another.  inbox? what is it doing? why is there a drop down menu if there is only one choice and no way to create a new one?   and of course no tutorial...,
It wouldn't bother that much with premium subscription. But it's the best I tried anyways,
"I've tried numerous task applications in my hunt for just the right system.  I'm certain I've found it.  ToDoist is simple enough for me to get in and get out of quickly, while being complex enough for me to organize my tasks and info as needed.  This is the FREE version mind you.  I am GLADLY going to pay the premium price (less than $2.50/mo) for the added features.  I love that they didn't cripple the FREE version to encourage subscribers like RTM does.  Great application + great ethics = win!!!",
It's a great device to cut through distraction.,
Syncs to a Web app and has a hierarchy structure. Suits my needs.,
"More than the app itself, having the web interface is great!",
Best way to sync tasks across multiple platforms.,
Even the free version has a lot of great features. Thanks for making this app,
Below free competition,
Best todo app out there with a multitude of ways to access,
Handy to do list app easy and practical to use,
very helpful app. must have for my daily life activities & planning. :)),
Best todo app by far But needs to drop prices of premium version drastically  They can add layers of premiumness,
Love this app and its integration with Google Chrome.,
Smooth product. Use for a lifetime,
Really considering to buy the premium,
Happy with this apo,
Faster synch and easy to use,
There's no way to review your completed tasks.,
It is really impressive!!! I love it! 6 stars,
Cek setiap hari untuk menambah produktifitas. Sinkronisasi juga bisa setiap saat dengan komputer ataupun gadget lain.,

Prefect for work!,
Good enough for a free app,
Extremely satisfied...,

"В нем есть все, что мне нужно. Особенно порадовала карма в браузерной версии. Будет здорово, если она будет и в мобильной",
ممتاز,
"I've been using Todoist since the beginning and its really become a fantastic tool for managing my life. Also,  the support is extremely helpful and personal; after I accidentally overloaded my account they helped me restore everything.",
I've tried various to-do systems on paper and online and this one is the best after only a few days of use. Clean and simple UI to focus on the tasks at hand and amazing availability across platforms. Just what I needed to start the new year right.,
Great app! Must download if you are managing a team. Useful for personal time management as well,
"Switched on first try to pro account, love the minimalistic look and the super fast android tablet app that I use on kindle.",
Does well for me. 4 star only because the design could look better and subtasks should be able to be minimized.  Edit-design updated and it's fantastic now!,
Just starting to use it and so far I really like it allot. User interface is gorgeous. Follows Android's app guidelines and Dev seems to enjoy helping others. Highly recommended,
"If you think about it, you're actually getting apps for mobile, web and desktop, and full synchronisation across all platforms for less than a decent coffee every month.  Works for me!",
"I really like this app and have been using it awhile after trying out heaps of different To do apps. The new update seems more useful but, I can't figure out how to share a task.",
It can not edit comments or notes. Why you enable the share function for four collaborators? The one star I gave because I have to wrote this rate.,
"This app looks simple and friendly. IMO, it needs to get a better priority intervals.",
"Now fixed. Support was excellent!   The last major 3.x version (todoist next) completely broke the project feature. I can't edit any of my existing tasks, nor can I create new ones... I love this app and I will be waiting for a fix to upgrade my review to a five stars!... Now fixed",
"I run my entire life with ToDoist. It's fantastic--tidy, intuitive, just what I want in a task management tool.",
"Great interface, easy to use, karma is a wonderful motivator",
"Great app, it's simple to use, and has great integration with your browser and Gmail! It's worth paying for the subscription!",
The best.. But a few missed out reminders,
No sync with Google tasks. The entire setup of tasks is not practical. And expensive.,
Amazingly easy to use. Does everything I need.,
But free version is very limited and really just an advert for the pro version,
Keeps getting better. The one app I actually use all the time :-),
But too much anoying,
Good multi-platform application. Simple yet powerful.,
Very useful to track to do stuff,
Won't let me add any tasks.,
Simple but full featured. Intuitive and flexible.,
Best all round to do app,
The best productivity app.,
This is the best.,

"I got this app because it looked promising from reading the reviews. However, I have never given any app request permission and password into my Google account, and surprised to see no one else having that concern. For that reason, I've not installed the app.",
"Todoist helps me manage multiple projects and tasks in a simple format that I can get at from all my devices. I thought I'd really want the integration w gmail and Google calendar, since those are my primary applications, but I found it so useful that I'm keeping it open on its own tab and have removed the extension from Gmail. And I love the invitation to take the afternoon off once I've finished all my tasks for the day!",
"I have been trying for 2 days to use this app. 1st it won't let me log in using a Google Account, now it won't add a task. Very disappointed. There is no way I could consider spending nearly $30 / year for this if the potential for these kinds of problems exist.  Support requests have been answered but nothing seems to have been resolved.  I'm sticking with Business Tasks for now.",
I'm using galaxy s4 and haven't received 3.0.4 update so I can't add anything since it just gets stuck on projects,
This is literally the greatest to do app. Obviously you need to pay for the full version but it keeps me on track with all my projects for work school and home.,
Even manages to make me feel bad about not meeting deadlines.  I needed that!,
Great app but any do works great!,
"Very short learning curve for me, as well as people I sent tasks too. I am hopeful the sync features will work well with my outlook tasks.  I like the date feature ""every xx days"" that makes the task reoccur x days from when you last did it, so if you get behind repeating tasks don't get stacked up / appear multiple times.",
"Tried many apps, ToDoist is great. Would give 5 stars IF ONLY there's a direct integration with Google Tasks rather than adding the ToDoist calendar's link within Google's Calendar. After subscribing to paid plan I found out that there's no direct integration like Any.Do. Hopefully this integration will arrive in future updates.",
"I installed this app on my phone and in my Gmail.   I even tried Firefox.   I then added tasks in each application.  Even though all apps are signed up under one Gmail account, they did not share info.   If I have to mess with it constantly to make it work. ... it's not worth having.",
"I would love a chance to really get into this app and evaluate it, but I'm sorry... notifications are not a premium feature. That is a real shame, as I am looking for my ultimate productivity app and I am more than willing to pay for one that actually works for me, but I'm not willing to pay 30 dollars to SEE if it works for me.   A suggestion, if you insist on keeping notifications as a premium feature. Offer a 1 month trial of the premium service, either free or at a lower cost, like 2-3 dollars.",
"UI is cleaner, and scheduling changes are good.   Collaboration tools are excellent, though would like them extended to tags or even individual tasks as well as projects. (Could only figure out how to invite people to projects. Am I missing something?) Since I delegate to folks in my office using tags for each person across many projects, it'd be excellent to invite each person as a collaborator on his/her own tag.",
"When accepting project invites through email: ""invalid secret code""  When trying to share using People app on HTC One: ""couldn't read your contact""  Duplicate tasks and duplicate names under collaborators.  Also, a subscription for premium is a big turn off.",
"I am in love with Todoist, and the organization behind it is slowly getting better. Their faults: releasing updates without telling you what the updates are (*EDIT: thanks for adding this in!), and ""visual scheduling"" was over-hyped.",
"Tried many to-do apps, but todoist is the most I liked for the useful interface.",
"Please learn and feature a function from Google Tasks, which allows us to sort projects (and maybe tasks) alphabetically for easy search ing.",
Todoist got it right!  Love this app and love their product.,
"A useful little app, but which loses points for pestering its users to rate it",
At least reduces the procrastinating :-p,
This application has a lot of promise. I especially like the availability on multiple platforms.,
I would seriously consider this app if it wasn't so expensive. $30 is just too much to see if it works for me. Get rid of the subscription and I will consider purchasing. Uninstalled,
"No thanks. They rope you in thinking this is a great app, then have to pay big money to get basic features. What a ripoff!",
Best task manager I have ever used.,
Does not sync with Google Tasks,
I love it!,
Really really really really,
"A very fluid, polished app that follows the Material design guidelines well. I would gladly pay a few dollars to upgrade to premium and unlock features like reminders and notes. However, a premium ""subscription"" costs $30 a year. It's definitely not worth 10x more than the next paid to-do app. Uninstalled.",
"You can set it up to email you a to do list daily or not. Check off what you get done and the rest rolls over to the next day...keeping the due date so you know how late you are. Excellent. Now it sorts by priority, too! They listen to suggestions and requests!",
I use todoist to remember everything from shopping lists to daily chores.  The cross platform support is awesome; I use the chrome plugin all the time.,
The truly ultimate todo app. Too bad I lack the discipline to use it regularly.,
"Does everything the website does, quick offline availability and it looks good too. If you pay for Todoist you'd be crazy not to use this. Crazy, do you hear? Crazy!",
Love this task management app for work projects and for personal stuff. Easy and intuitive.,
"Excellent tasker, allows sub tasks and moving due dates with just a click.",
Necessary to keep tracks on projects while on the move,
The best to do app I've found.  And its on everything.  Constantly improving.,
El mejor To-Do que hay en todas las plataformas.,
Amazing support and features! Love it!,
Great app keeps me organised.,
Perfect in its simplicity.,
Always reminds me of wat is to be done for the day,
easy to use,
Excellent app,
Great app,
Great App,
"Todoist has been a great and handy app. With the one month premium trial, I was able to see all the app had to offer and I must say it is better than any other app I have for this task. However, mobile push notifications seem to have stopped working these past couple of days and I don't know how to fix it. I hope this issue can be resolved. Thanks",
"I've been using Todoist (Premium) for a couple of years, and so I was very happy when they finally came out with an Android app. The app really cleared up a lot of problems that the mobile website had (like not displaying sub-tasks properly). Since then, the app just keeps better. A definite recommendation, especially if you have the Premium version of Todoist.",
I only give a three star rating as I am not able to compare with other similar utilities. This was the first to do app I d loaded and have been more than satisfied with the features on the free version.  I can manage without the premium features so unfortunately the developers are missing out on my dollar.,
"Like many users, I have tried various apps in this category. Some have been a waste of time others very good. This one however is by far the best I have found. It is reliable, and so simple to use. I have a laptop, tablet and smartphone and the syncing between them is super fast always accurate and flawless. Well done to those who created it!",
"This app is great to manage our grocery, hardware store,  spouse-to do lists, etc. We can use the online access for fast entry of lots of items. It updates to our phones. It allows us to add to each other's list so we don't have to ""remind each other"" What to get at the store.",
I really appreciate all the functions even in the free mode. It has helped me alot developing my business. Totally recommended. My first review since the beginning of using android. It is just too good not to give a co mment on.,
"I was an avid Franklin Planner user.  It was my goal to go completely paperless.  I tried a couple other to do list tools, but nothing worked as seamlessly as Todoist.  I have integrated with Chrome, my Android phone, my Nexus 7, and Outlook, allowing me to link all of my tasks and access them pretty much anywhere.  I love the color coding, which allows me to determine what project each task relates to visually.  I also like the Karma feature that rates my planning performance.  Great App!!",
"I have tried them all and I always end up back here. Nothing else seems to compare with Todoist 's ability to hit all the right requirements (attractive, intuitive, solid multi platform syncing).",
"There is more place for improvement ,ex. If isetsome task i would like to have rule that every n days create this task automaticaly. There is also huge number of win.phone users so app for this devices is more than recomended if TD aiming tobe one of the best product on market. Overall impression verry good product,i'm happy that i found it after more than 4 moths of searching and testing.",
"I migrated to Todoist after 5+ years on RTM. Love the mobile integration, powerful API and pace if innovation. Right now the best TODO app in the okay store.... And trust me, I reviewed the all.",
"Todoist is definitely one of the best to-do systems available right now. I've tried a variety of apps for task management, but most have unnecessary features, poor UX, or technical errors. I used Wunderlist before, but I had consistent problems with the web app not syncing properly.  I haven't had any such complaints yet with Todoist. I use every feature in it--aside from tags, I haven't found a use for them that other features don't cover--and I haven't found any bugs that aren't solved quickly.",
"Supports everything needed for GTD, including ""recur after last completed"" repeating events ( perfect for chores) and subtasks. Todoist is probably the best option for a todo list out there, and in my opinion it is way better than Wunderlist.",
"I am so glad to finally find a task management system that works!   I've tried so many of them, only to run into a fatal flaw that ultimately rendered them unused.  This is a system that works for me.   Here's what I like: 1. It can integrate with Outlook, so my list is right there all the time. 2. I can automatically sort by date & priority, then I can quickly drag and drop to arrange tasks in a sequence that works for me. 3.  When I think of new tasks while driving, I can voice dictate new tasks using the Todoist Add Task Widget.  When I get to the office the new tasks are there written up in my task inbox. (voice dictation is dependent on other software.).  I'm a a child of the Franklin Planner in the 90's, but like element of the GTD system.  ToDoist is a perfect balance, allowing me to adapt it to my different context.  It is simple enough that it actually gets used.  It is adaptable enough that I want to use it.  It is powerful enough to turn mountains of work into real productivity.  I am captivated by this product.",
This app really helped to keep me on track this Christmas with tasks I had to do with family coming to celebrate.  Great to have reminders of what I had to do or what I missed.,
"I've been hunting for a good todo list app for a while that would sync well between my phone, tablet, and PCs. I was using Wunderlist for the last 8 months and shifted to Todoist after trying it for a week. Better and faster syncing plus I find the UI easier to use.",
"I just want a list. I don't need due dates, priorities,  colors and categories. I can do all the organizing on the fly when reviewing the list. Todoist let's me get away with that; it handles the remembering and I manage the rest. Lovely. Synchronizing against all my screens moves it to firmly into the ""perfect"" category. - By the way, the app DOES support all those other features for those who want 'em, but it supports my zippety-task model well without putting the other stuff in my way. The pull-down ""task anywhere"" feature is pure gold.",
So far I am loving it! Something I do like however is the privileged of trying pro versions of any app before I buy it. I have learned a hard lesson on buying and not trying an application. That last  remark not related in any way with this particular app.  Thank you for a great free app!,
Really like this app. Works great across platforms. Simple and awesome UI.  Only reason why this is not getting 5 stars is because the annual fee is quite high.,
Excellent app if used in conjunction with the website. Easy and appealing way to keep track of all the things you need to get done.,
"The free version is great and easy to use. The Android app version is good, but could be improved by some slight tweaks. It would be nice to have some drag and drop functionality as well as a more intuitive interface.",
"Helps me remember all the things I have to do now, someday and later. Can organize them many different ways and has a clean simple and intuitive UI. would definitely recommend, can't live with out it!",
"It does exactly what i need it to, organizing tasks is a super simple and efficient manner. No hazzle with anything, creating and viewing the tasks is only one click away.",
Have worked with many products. Very keen on Evernote but in fast pace work environment it takes too long.  Todoist is a great tool under these conditions and recomend it highly.,
"Todoist is a clean, simple to do and project management app that gets the job done without clutter and excess. It has just enough features to track day-to-day tasks and multiple task projects.",
Needs getting to know and  really needs the full Pro version to get maximum benefit but it is realy useful and is worth it in the time saved once you get organised. Needs personal discipline though otherwise you can spend a lot of time organising and not doing!,
"Wasn't sure if it would be worth the subscription price for full features but I couldn't be happier. Have it on all my devices, computers and email. Love the connectivity, features and design of this.",
Though a lot of features are only after you pay. Will use some more n perhaps part with some $ later,
Only thing is - if you want the premium version you have to pay £19 per year which is a complete joke,
"I can't figure out how to get the reminders to work, but it looks like I have to pay 28.99. Not going to happen.",
"Very good, easy to use. Would be nice to have some color coding or small icons to differentiate between different projects",
"This app has really helped me in my productivity. Todoist karma helps me to been on track and earn more points, which some how pushes me to accomplish more.",
"App is wht I needed the most, removes unnecessary tension of missing something..thank u for the help",
"I have been looking for the app with everything for a couple years now. I love the project lists, the notes, and the tie ins with chrome and gmail.",
"Basically it's useless unless you pay for it, and all features you get from paying are available on other free apps. I don't mind paying for quality apps, but this is ridiculous.",
"I like how even though I didn't complete the task today, it still shows up in the list the next day.",
"Very good for every day use. Not been using it long but not come across any glitches. Keeps me organised and able to use it on my mobile which is handy. ""Happy""",
"Todoist is everywhere, in outlook and Gmail on my tablet and web. It's functionality is also great with priorities, colors, categories, tags, and alarms. It even texts me the alarm. Great program!",
Could make archived entries easier to be displayed in the free version and have an undo option for the last operation too..,
"And im not supporting your crack habits your crazy what ever happened to $6.99 upgrades,  the creaters of this app are fat headed",
"If you love to organise using lists, this is the app for you. Really like the widget on my nexus 7 tablet and the dash clock integration. Great app, very user friendly, makes herding cat a realistic possibility! Managed to increase my productivity tenfold... where have you been all my life?!",
But it does have a habit of failing.  Don't depend on it in a crunch.  One more thing: won't delete your account: they keep your files forever...,
"This app got me doing everything I needed on time! It's rewarding to use, and I can't imagine being half as organised without it.",
This is a wonderful app for managing projects and to-do's on a daily basis.  The only downside is that reminders and notes are only in the paid version. And that the paid version is more expensive per year than other similar apps.,
"This app has more than doubled my level of productivity and allowed me to get projects done more efficiently. I also love the fact that it syncs with my android phone, my computer, google chrome, my gmail as well as my iPad. I have my list everywhere I need it without ever having to worry that I won't have access to the things I need to get done. Todoist rocks!",
I use this on a daily basis and its part of the standard toolkit. This works as advertised and that's a really rare quality.,
"Perfect for keeping tasks synced on desktop, mobile, and gmail. After using a new list every few months, finally found something I can use consistently",
Software is simple yet very functional. Support for various platforms is a very welcome.  Would like to see wedoist integration and feature parity.,
"The app does well other than the widget on my tablet doesn't refresh with having to go into the full app and manually make it refresh. On cell, it has the refresh button an widget so its more convenient.",
The free version is perfect to keep track especially since I use it over multiple devices.  When the need comes for filters I will have no problem in purchasing this app. Great work.,
"Easy to find where things are, and the reminders are up to par as well. Only thing I'd suggest is to make it fun to use.",
App is not demanding and allows me to use it with ease.  Doesn't hassle me to go premium. Which kind of makes me want to buy it.,
Good app. Works well with web version. Convenient. Helps to keep my shambolic self organised.,
"The functions of this are limited and it's really expensive to get full version. No voice input, which others offer. There are much better free apps that do more.",
"The app is the easiest to keep my to do list over my tablet, computer & phone.  I like the looks of some if the premium features, but it is a little bit too expensive for my blood",
I use this to list my project. Design in the best but functionality to limited for free user. Other task application can give more free feature than this,
I had been searching for an app to help keep me on task and organized. So far i love todoist.  It's uncomplicated and does exactly what i need.,
"With a few minor interface glitches, it's still a superb app. I do wish for an ""input only"" lock screen widget.",
This app is one of the best productivity apps I have ever used. Could not recommend more highly.,
"We are using the paid version to manage household chores, a remodel, garden tasks, bill payment, pet chores (vet visits, tags, etc.), etc. We use it on Android and the web, plus as the back-end for a simpler Android app for another user in the family. Wish it could do every 2nd Thursday of every other month, though.",
"I like its minimalist design, the options offered are fair. however reminders do not help, and the cost for the extra options not justify paying a monthly fee.",
Great app and site that is making me much more productive than my previous task manager.,
This To-Do manager has been around for quite a while and keeps getting better.  It really is pretty intuitive.,
"I use this constantly and it's fast, efficient and reliable. Well worth the money for a premium account in my opinion.",
Pretty holo app but keeps on spaming to upgrade even after I un subscribe.  Don't like that I get daily emails with my to do on it.  Don't know how secure my data is.  Will uninstall.,
Excellent cross platform apps all have the feel and appearance.  First To do app I actually enjoy using.,
"I use this app for all of my to-do lists. I also use it to keep track of homework assignments... I have found that it is much better than most apps that are dedicated to keeping track of school work. I also love that it syncs across all of my devices. Over all, its a phenomenal app. Five stars for sure,",
Simple interface. Easy to use. And looks great too. Can't find another app better than this.,
"With some useful updates like re-ucurring task that re-uccur with their subtasks this app become even more amazing. There is still a couple of features I would like to see in the app like a progress for multi tier tasks and projects, but I still give this app a 5	Awesome App",
"No problems. I like that I can repeat events and tasks without re-entering them. I can also edit or postpone a task. There are groups to help organize tasks, such as home, work, etc.",
Love the functionality of the free version; can make unlimited projects and lists with sub-tasks within. Considering the premium version since I use this app daily for school!,
I use this app everyday. Works flawlessly and I love that it syncs to google chrome. It's downfall is that it doesn't have very many features unless you want to pay for it.,
Works very well for me. I just use three categories and do the rest with tags.  No performance issues on Android but it can be a bit slow to start on PC.,
Organizing tasks by categories has increased my efficiency and is one my favorite features of todoist.  I use this app constantly and know once I have entered a task it is captured and won't be forgotten or lost until it's checked off.  I am grateful for the  improvements in my use of time and accomplishments because of this very helpful app.,
"Please add dark theme, not everyone like shining eye hurting white theme",
"Very nice app, nice UI but the desktop version can be enhanced a bit. Mobile app is amazing.",
I like the android to outlook synk! I don't like that I have to pay annually to get the good features.,
I love that I can make color  coded project lists with subtasks in the free version. The more I use it the more I think I might have finally found the solution to my frustrations with other task list apps.,
"After trying out many ""to do"" apps, I found this one to be the easiest to use and give me everything I need in the free version.  Thanks!",
This a a nice simple app that's well integrated into gmail. Give it a spin.,
"Can't use without account creation. Basic feature like reminders is premium, and it's not clear from app description",
Enjoyed using this app. Better than some other to do list apps that I have used in the past.,
"I plan on going pro & Idk if there are other themes included in the pro version, but I would really like a black theme, please.",
"It has just enough features to still be easy to use, and I swear by it. Every time I think of something I need to do, or buy, or any time someone tells me a good movie, I throw it into todoist. I love it! Thanks!",
This is very useful and very easy to use. U don't know what I'd do with our this app,
The app is great but sort of difficult to use on phone.,
It will keep reminding you everyday for outstanding issue until you complete it. Through email and handset.,
$29 a year is very steep for an app like this. At that price it makes more sense to get Evernote,
So easy to enter items to do and recurring tasks.,
My personal and professional lives couldn't run so smoothly without todoist.,
Very well thought interconection with other os platforms.,
Great all edit I want to.I would extra label and remind alert.,
I think this is a great program. I love taking the pressure off my brain and organizing my tasks by day and importance.,
Very easy to use but i am stil trying to find how it sync with other program.,
"Always liked the interface, and the task management utilities are powerful. Been using for a year without a problem.",
"Waiting just for some features to come... This app is very easy to use and works well, so if you need a to do list, then try this one :)",
"Tried a lot of other to-do lists without success.  This one got it right! Quick to access from phone, email, browser, and such.  Easy to organize and manage. LOVE it!",
GREAT APP. But it does not remind you at the time u want but at the scheduled time for review. Is this because it's the free version? There reviewing time should be more than once as well.,
Converting tasks to projects would be amazing,
"Simple yet powerful app. Nicely done, looking forward to whats next.",
This app has been an answer to my prayers.  It helps me out so much. Highly recommend it.,
"A to-do app that has everything I want. Recurring tasks, sync, projects... Better than the rest.",
It's nice simple to do app but I think the premium plan is totally over priced. I think $4.99 is fair price for the premium subscription.,
"Better than all other GTDs out there. And yes I've literally tried them all, paid and free.",
"The most robust to-do list app on the market,  and I tried them all.",
Can't believe I didn't discover this sooner.blows other to do apps out of the water,
Well organized and excellent sync between devices. Using on Samsung note 3.,
Very useful for daily schedule n specially for who forgets can jot so can find it,
Had to move from astrid when it closed....so pleased I did as this is great.,
Allows me to quickly set tasks and be reminded about them later. Crucially it works and makes me more productive,
"I still haven't tried it but from all the others, it looks more cozy and less complicated.",
Cancelled my Remember the Milk subscription. Love the minimalistic look and ability to create subtasks,
"It helps you plan and reminder you of the activities that u still.have pending,I like it",
Simple and it works across a lot of platforms and devices. Recommend this app wholeheartedly.,
Great app! Best to do list I've found. Beats workflowy and Google tasks,
Works flawlessly. Interface is simple yet filled with tons of options. I love this app.,
Perfect for getting that list in your head down somewhere so that nothing gets missed! Love the widget on home screen the most!,
This app has boosted my productivity so much. The premium is definitely worth it!,
Integrates with everything. Best I have found!,
This is my go-to app for my to-do list. It's simple and easy to learn and use,
great app..must install this one mpsahota,
I love this app. I use it for every thing!,
"Simple, light and beautiful, have google's style",
Wonderful software. Works flawlessly!,
desktop-mobile sync and consistent usability on both sides are huge pluses.,
Fluid GUI. Worked right into it. Good job devs,
Extremely useful...but adding a specific timing to each task would be great addition,
Easy to use.  Great options for a free tool.  Integrates easy across devices.,
"Reminder is not a free feature, also there is no option to make a checklist under a task",
It organizes your to-do lists very well and has an excellent widget,
Helps me remember what I need to get done..,
"I use it on a PC, in Outlook, with browser extensions and all my Android devices. Invaluable!",
Very simple to use and helpfull to track tasks... I srongly recommend,
This is a great way to keep track of all that there is to do.,
I use this app to log my next appointment and I love the widget so I can schedule my appointments  at a glance,
I'm enjoying this a lot.  I think it will help increase my productivity.,
Buena pero me parece costosa su versión premium,
I need to do better.  This app was the first step.,
I use it daily a across all platforms.,
It has been excellent working with particularly the regular update on task and performance. Good one.,
Love the option of syncing  across multiple platforms. Worth buying the premium version.,
Very well organized and clean looking. But could do with a lower fee.,
Wish I had downloaded sooner!,
Syncing automatically to my computer? Awesome! And I love the little karma thing.,
Like the cross-platform functionality. Lots of features to learn.,
There are some similar products but todoist functions in a more comprehensive way.,
I have been using this app both on android iOS and my computer. It is rock solid and as simple or as complex as you want it to be. On top of that the design is elegant and straightforward. And it is free. Say what!!!?!,
"Loving the features, syncability, and ease of use.",
Great little app and when used in combination with the chrome plug-in and the gmail extension = amazing! :),
Needs to have the karma graph as the desktop version does.,
Great way to manage your tasks... Simple and effective.,
Very helpful!  Fuels my productivity imensly.,
Simple and powerful Five stars!,
I especially love the app just wish they had a few different options like location aware task notifications,
Love it very useful,
Does exactly what I expect from a modern todo list app,
The combination of this app with their website make for a fantastic task system,
Almost every todo actually lists out the actual items... you should give the same option...,
Helps me organise projects for work and home,
Love this app easy to use syncs across all my devices,
Bedt task manager ever across all platforms,
"Intuitive, simple to use, great UI. Perfect sync between phone and office. Recommended!",
Love!! I've tried a couple others but this is the best,
"Co$ts too much!    Many better, cheaper more cost efficient apps are available.     .... AVOID THIS POSA!",
If only it came with extra hours in the day...,
"Beautiful, minimal and integrates with Gmail.",
Perhaps the best to-do list out there.,
Extremely useful for getting stuff done. I just wish the premium was free :(,
Smooth and easy to use..very clean interface,
Amazing! Best App of its kind.,
Simple to use and well integrated across various platforms...,
I would rather than pay evernoxx,
Love this app!  Keeps me organized.,
Needs to be easier to show completed task and visualizations.,
"Love it, just wish it had the option to auto delete",
The best to do list app ever!,
Cool app and wonderful task planner i recommend,
Simple yet detailed task management system,
Great app.  Easy to use and gmail integration is terrific,
Love it.. works great to be organized for school and work..,
Big fan.,
Help to orgenize my thoughts.,
Like the simple interface & web access,
But it blows up ur email,
It even tells u how productive u have been!,
Força a venda do módulo premium sem ao menos você conhecer os benefícios.,

Very helpful in managing my time,

Very beneficial app to use,
I love it,
Well done,
Really cool and very usefull app,
"I so enjoy that this program marries my todos to my Outlook, desktop, smartphone and the Web.  BRILLIANT!!",
No dark theme? Really? Why there isn't one baffles me. Won't purchase upgrade until it's implemented... 3 stars until then.,
This app is very helpful!!,
GREAT!! helps me organise everything,
Incredible UI and functionality.,

"Eh muito difícil encontrar um aplicativo de tarefa sem muita firula e simples de usar. Esse ate agora eh o melhor, embora tenha alguns pontos desnecessariamente confusos ainda.",
,
"Great app, clean interface, easy to use, Evernote integration would make it perfect	I've only just started using the application but I have to say that this one is by far the best for my GTD process.  I clean and easy to use interface is key otherwise it is a chore to use.  From what I've seen so far the premium service is absolutely a requirement.  Please consider adding Evernote integration which would tie it together with my notes and  documentation.",
"Love how smooth the app works especially it's fast syncing among different platforms. However, the free version gets only 4 stars as it lacks simple features like reminders and notes. I still think the premium features are a bit pricey considering most of these features are free on other apps. I'm still using this cause I like how easy it is to manage tasks in multiple projects.",
"Saw this mentioned on Lifehacker as intrgrated with Outlook. It really is a super integration and the fact that I can get to Todoist from any device deals the deal. Have been using heavily for a couple of weeks and am reaching a point where my To Do's are helping me focus on the right priorities, instead of wasting my time organizing and reorganizing them.",
"I am really liking this app, with all its useful features and easy interface, but you really don't get enough out of it unless you're a premium member. I've also had trouble with push notifications going off on time. All in all, a beautiful app with a few drawbacks.",
"I think I've tried every to-do app. Literally. I love that this one has a good extension and ability to easily postpone tasks by one day. Also, you can add tasks from the pulldown shade. Oh, and the premium features are reasonable so that the app isn't completely hampered. If you're looking for the perfect to-do app, this might not be it, but you have to try it.",
"I love this app! If I could change one thing, it would be to have the ability to refresh the widget. I always have to open the program and refresh it from there before the widget will update. Other than that, this is the best to do list I've found! My VERY favorite thing is that it allows you to integrate the to do list with gmail, so I'm able to turn emails into tasks!",
"The best todo manager in existence. Ive tried them all paid and failed. This is the godfather of all of the todo apps on the android market. Blending design classiness with robust features! Syncs with google calendar too! Add tasks from ur homescreen, combined with digical I now have an all rounded productivity powerhouse at my fingertip! Please add a few themes!!",
"This app has gotten better and better over the years, helped especially by the team's singular focus on being the best personal to-do manager across all platforms. Indispensable on the home screen of all my devices.",
"If you work across Android, Mac, Linux, etc. Todoist has you covered. Besides also being the best mix of simplicity and sophistication. Great looking and easy to use I expect to be using Todoist for a long time.",
"Very good app, especially if you have a premium account for the additional features.  Not the prettiest todo app, but it certainly gets the job done.",
This app is fantastic. Its so simple yet very intuitive and elegant. I recommended to my friend and he loved it.,
Todoist had all the things I need at the tip of my finger. The widget  is also very good. Love it,
"If you are a power to do lister but don't like the cumbersome interfaces of advanced to do apps, this one is for you. Tons of ways to use the app but always simple and easy to read and use.",
"Only thing I would like is archive of done tasks for a few days at least, in case they need to be done again.",
"Wish I could access more features without having to upgrade, I.e. syncing with calendar and sharing lists.",
I use this app together with the desktop and tablet versions to organize my day. It's super easy to use and the karma points keep me motivated to stay on track. The ability to have projects and subtasks makes it the complete package for me.  Great job.  Will consider the upgrade when the extra features are needed.,
Everything I need.  There are some issues with thunderbird plugin but minor.  Good job guys,
"Impressive integration. Very fast.  I would like to be able to sort my list by name, date, and priority like I can on the site.",
"Lässt einfach gar nichts zu wünschen, das Beste kommt allerdings nur wenn man ein Premium Abo kauft, reminders und notes. Lohnt sich aber jedes Cent  P. S.  UI ist einfach Superb",
"Todoist as a whole is a wonderful task management system! This app is good but I would like to be able to create/manage labels within the app and also see my Karma. Also, the home screen widget is kind of large which means I have to use a whole screen to see the list.",
"I don't mind you put in a premium features price but please mention it on the description and don't waste our time trying out. And 29.99 usd a year is really a joke, I can get awful lot from other good deed dev with that kind of money.",
"This is the best app I""ve used to date. Integrates fairly well with Google calendar which is important to me. Easy to use.",
Use it on desktop and my android..love quick task widget. . It's simple app with great interface and perfectly does its job. .,
I am an ocd planner and organizer. I use todoist and doist applications for everything. I would not be as far in life without todoist. Thanks team (:,
"I purchased the annual subscription and absolutely love this app! The ability to sync across all the platforms I use (phone, Outlook, and Google calendar and Google Mail), keeps my task up-to-date and always in sync. Looking forward to seeing the UI mature. Thanks for a great app.",
Helps me stay on task for all my school assignments. I would highly recommend to anyone who needs to stay organizationed!,
Works great for me. Free version has almost all required features. Web version and Chrome plugin are very helpful as well.,
"I am leaving the app only because reminders, which I see as a basic feature of a ""todo list app"", is instead a paid feature. Otherwise the best task list I have used.",
"I've used many task list program's and this links seamlessly between desktop, web and phone without a hitch. Perfect for work, home and personal projects. Also the date recognition functionality is fantastic, allowing me to type quick deadlines like ""next Tues"" or ""tomo"". Thoroughly recommended!",
"One of the best interfaces I've ever used for a TODO app. While there are some necessary features missing for non-paying users (reminders ), the low price makes it worth subscribing.",
"The mobile app seems to not update any of the changes that I make on it randomly but frequently. So I might plan the full day & synchronize but few minutes to hours later, I get the task order that I had yesterday!  And the app doesn't even have a option to submit feedback or bugs!",
Not Cost effective. but good UI,
"Can't share calendars, tasks, etc.  Seems that only projects can be shared.  Saw no way to invite/create a group to share with.  Have no idea if a shared item will notify others since that is a premium feature.  Will stick with Time Tree for now",
"After years of looking for the right to do list, this it's the one for me. Multiple platforms, easy interface, it is perfect.",
"Cross platform support, easy and intuitive interface are a big big plus. Makes managing check lists very simple. A must have!!",
"Just downloaded this app a few days ago and so far, so good! I've been looking for a ""task manager"" and this is by far my favorite of the ones I've tried.",
"There are other apps that do the same, but I haven't found anything that does it as beautifully.",
"It has good features, but it's too expensive. I stay with any.do",
On my moto x I say note to blah blah blah and it works yet tells me there's no app to store it to. Please help!,
does everything it should and unobtrusively does even more if you want that.,
"SO SICK of being sucked into loading these 'SIMPLE' APPS..... once you download so-called FREE APP, you THEN find out you have to pay! And I don't see even a price.  I'm staying away from these types of insidious apps/developers who don't even have the guts to FIRST disclose the price for their ""premium"" app. I'm done!!!!",
"-It does practically nothing, inc setting alarms or adding notes, unless you want to upgrade to £18/year. Don't bother.",
Easy to prioritize and organize to do lists by category and/or time.,
Love it! Best task list available. I even paid for the premium version.,
"Just one word to say , everything else can be freely  checked in this FREE app",
"Easy, simple, well integrated with phone, web, and email services.",
I like this app because it does what it's meant to do..every time!,
Lots and lots of features and it flows the design principles. Awesome!,
Makes my life more organised,
Very nice and useful application to manage to do list,
Way better than a lotta paid ones out there,
but it's okay,
Awesome in keeping you focused on the tasks that are important and needing to be completed!,
Easy to use and we'll featured.,
I'm starting to be more productive.,
Does what it's supposed to and more!,
Not paying $30 a year for premium features.,
Does everything you need.,
Wish there was a windows phone version.,
Best multi-platform seamless to-do tool I've seen.,
Still a beginner but enjoying it.,
"Awesome design.  Simple, clean yet very customizable for all uses. Download it. Do it!",
Simple clean interface,
Unexpectedly this is the worst app ever! And they're saying it is free?? This is premium! Do not download this .,
Love.,
Very helpful.,
Must pay $28.99/yr to take full advantage of software.   $30 a year?!   Pff.   Riiight.       $30 once?   Maybe................................maybe....,
Wish it had a miss call option.,
upgrade to set reminder is dumb. setting reminder should be free.,
Great App!,
Gets the job done!!! Good App!!,
Wonderful!,
Love it!,
Best todo app available,
Simple n effective,
Handy app for the purpose,
Good app.,
Costly but good,
Excellent and easy to use,
^^^^^^^^^^^,
Very good,
Excellent app,
Great App,
Awesome,
Excellent,
"I like the simplicity of this app. This definitely helps me keep track of all the things I need to get done. The biggest draw for me is the cross platform compatibility. I always have a Todoist tab open in my browser. My biggest gripe is the lack of an auto refresh for the widget. Having to open the app just so I could sync it honestly defeats the purpose of having this widget on my phone since I use both browser and mobile versions of this frequently. If this could be added, I would give this 5 stars.",
Lot of low ratings because this app is apparently advertised as free without warning about the limitations of a non-premium account. To be clearer they should stress that this app supports your use of online todoist account. Its not really meant to stand alone.,
"Ha ha. You don't even know how to sell your app. The features you offer in the free version are not even worth trying. Uninstalling in 2 minutes after installing it. Edit: I need a few things to be working right for even to ""try the app"" for a few days before taking any decision to buy. If I liked the features I'd go ahead and buy it, but as I said, you probably just don't want to sell it.",
helps get things quickly 'assigned'. I look forward to see what the developers do next,
This app is awesome and the Google now integration make it better.  The only thing I wish we could get is a 4x1 widget and the ability for the app to set a due date when using Google now.  Keep up the awesome work!,
Definitely helped me organize a step more then I've been. So far so good. There is more I haven't got to in depth with though. So that may add a star eventually,
"Please implement a setting of the widget, where I could enable two columns on this widget. Now there's only one column and too much empty space",
An otherwise beautifully designed application and well polished. Forget email/SMS reminders but you still need to pay for in app reminders. Absurd! Don't cripple the most basic functionality. At least make in-app reminders free. Charge for SMS and Email reminders if you have to!,
For the cross platform availability of this app you'd be hard pressed to find a better way to organize yourself.,
This app will help you complete daily task and stay focused on short and long term goals.  Must have app and it works with Google now voice commands.,
Need a little bit of learning. But overal it's a app that will meet your need when segmenting tasks into subtasks.,
"Todoist is beautiful, but critical ""features"" are paid for. Google keep offers more for free.   Edit: You can't cripple your app and expect people to pay. Consumers pay for innovation, not limitation. Reminders, ""view all categories"", etc, these are things that are ""standard"". A note keeping app that can't keep you organized is worthless.",
I've been using Todoist online and on Android for a while now and it's stayed simple while becoming more and more powerful with each feature.,
"Why would I pay for ""premium"" features when I can get those same ""premium"" features (sync, reminders, attachments) for free using Google Keep/Reminders.  Good design but I would NOT recommend this product.  Uninstalled.",
Todoist helps me to organize and get things done. Great app.,
Pay? For such simple things you offer in premium and yet you ask us to pay? I think you are taking this too likely dev. Install and uninstalled. Bye,
It works great,
"Simple to use, good UI.",
Very useful app to organise your life.,
Great tool.  Works well on all platforms.,
This is the easiest app to use,
Best todo app out!,
Kit Kat support!!! Thanks.,
"I now feel like my life is more organized! This app is clean, QUICK, and SO SIMPLE TO USE! SO much better than any other to do list app I've tried. I'm trying the premium trial right now, and I have no doubt I'll purchase the year subscription. The ease of use is the biggest selling point to me.",
Does what I want; intrudes only when appropriate!,
"I use this app every day to manage my tasks. The way it syncs between my phone, tablet and the web makes this really great. Regular app updates just add to the overall worth!",
Perfect to do app. I 've tried lots of apps but this one is awesome.,
I have difficulty being organized but this app has helped me to improve in this area.  Thank you!,
Great. Premium is worth all the extra functionality. Team keeps adding new features,
"Wonderful, but needs a black/dark theme (along with widget)",
.. would it be possible to have the possibility to sync with Google tasks?,
Just downloaded the app and set two reminders. It didn't notify me at all,
great way to stay organized!,
Best todo app. Just it.,
"Heirarchical lists are the most natural way to manage tasks for me. I tried out all kinds of to-do list apps. I'm happy Todoist got it right! I've been a premium user for a year now, and the improvements in that time make renewing my subscription a no-brainer.",
"The description for this app is extremely misleading; you will have to pay and ""go Premium"" in order to do any of the basis features that a slew of other to-do list apps offer for free. Yes, you can sign up for a free trial month, but when you inevitably forget to cancel, you will be charged $29 for a year (or $4 per month) , which is way too much for a service like this. Bad business practices and a very average app, in my opinion. Uninstalled.",
"This app is great. It has all features you need in a todo app and the sync function is very reliable. I bought a premium account to support you guys, keep on the great work (one little thing I'd like to mention: please add a dashclock extension ;) )",
"Love that this app is functional across several platforms: android, Web, desktop, Outlook, Gmail, etc. Best I've found so far since Astrid went defunct. Wish it was a little more compact visually, but overall love the functionality - tagging, projects, priorities, color-coding, ability to set several reminders and notifications, create subtasks, and more. I like it so much, I paid for premium membership to get the extra perks. Give it a shot if you're looking for optimum functionality and customization.",
I would have stayed with google tasks if the would have a decent offline option. The offline computer app of todoist is quite great. But this mobile app has for me two issues: I really don't need so many folders. I want to be able to customize it. The other thing is the interface for entering new tasks has a rally small screen. It's a pain.,
"I've tried a few organizers.  This one works because it's simple.  A basic checklist lets you see up to 7 days out.  You can define projects, create custom task labels,  prioritze, and get reminders. I prefer this to others because it's quick and easy. .. making it more likely to be used",
"You want a great todo app with lots of promise? Wunderlist! The good features of this app is in premium, if not for those features then it's just like any old todo app with a slightly prettier widget.  (if you're wondering why only one star, it's because of a past bad experience I had with them which cannot be detailed here)",
"Has some really nice features. Simple yet powerful. However, in today's saturated Android task list manager market, there's no excuse whatsoever for not having alarms (ie notifications) on tasks free! That's pretty much STANDARD... I shouldn't have to pay just to be notified that I have a task set for a certain time! And I don't need to be reminded by email, just a notification... It's on my phone! Skip all the productivity tracking and all that stuff and give me free notifications and auto sync!",
"So I've been using any.do for a few months and decided to give this a try,  the interface is clean and I tried it to see if it was any better. These guys seriously want me to pay a monthly fee for the same thing that any.do does. Sorry, it's nice but other apps do it for free,  moving back after 1 day of use.  The developer states that they can't maintain cross platform for free, so how do other apps do it? Wizardry?",
"As an organizational tool this app is awesome. I especially like that I can break a big task down into smaller tasks that I don't have to ""see"". This really helps me as I'm very visual and too many tasks tend to overload.",
"Is all i get when i sign in.frustration.I'll give u until i get up in the morning,then if its not working, i will uninstall. APPS HAVE TO WORK ALL THE TIME",
This is a great way to increase the amount of work you can get done daily. The ability to prioritize the take is something most other sops don't have. I moved from any. Do and don't miss it at all. I have recommended this for my staff and can't wait to see the improvements.,
"This app is perfect as you can update your todois on the computer, phone and tab and always be up to date never forgetting anything.",
Tried many others but it's the most practical I found.  Could be smoother but developers improve on regular basis.,
"Try to sign up and even create an account but I keep getting""an error has occured, try again later.""",
Thisis one of the best todo apps i came across. Much better then todo-pro for osx. And multiplatform. I like it and it works perfectly.,
I prefer Regularly. Things to do on a specific date I put in my agenda. Even after ininstall todoist continued sending me reminders of long overdue tasks.,
"If planning and organizing is important to you, then this is an excellent app for ones daily use.",
Would like to see option to move the menu bar to the bottom for easy one handed operation. Nice that you can drag tasks to a different day,
"Really need a month with all the features free before committing to buy. I've found many productivity apps real cool at first but then found  not so useful and forgotten about them. Disabling features from day one really makes this app quickly get lost, although I do like the nifty ideas  Why not allow users to try everything for 30 days?   Also the links to emails in a task seem to go to the default gmail account that's registered to google play on an android which is a problem when you have 2 accounts",
Best GTD backed to-do app so far. However adding tag is not intuitive whereby need to cancel current issue just to create tag and then create the issue again. After a while when most of the tag has been created then this scenario is not common anymore,
"Best todo manager I've used. No one can offer such integration options: browsers, android and iOS. And all of these is working like a charm",
Excellent app great sync for all your notes to access via phone pc or tab. Now links great with gmail. Highly recommended.,
Everything I want in a to do app. Only problem is that Google calendar sync seems buggy sometimes. Also the reminder function seems a little tedious and not as fluid with the app as I would like. Worth it to pay the subscription though!,
An efficient  to one your daily tasks..An alarm time for each task would be better rather than highlighting all tasks at a single time,
"Some how it doesn't pop up the tasks planned for today, it just pops up due tasks for yesterday. Primarily it should pop up tasks for today and also as per scheduled time in the tasks",
I like a place to put the little things I have to remember to do. This app works perfect.,
"Generally excellent. The Gmail/chrome toolbar integration is highly buggy. Other than that, well worth buying.",
"The main three greatnesses of ToDoist is its minimalist design, great functionality and variety of supported devices.",
I keep getting 'Couldn't reach Google servers....'. Tried it on WiFi and Verizon.  I even had a hard time authenticating my Google account with Todoist via a web browser.,
"Todist is simple to use, but effective. As well, the todist karma system makes completing tasks fun. It would be nice to have a calendar view of tasks.",
"Simple and beautiful, it does exactly what I want it to do. I like being able to have different projects with colours to organise my tasks as well as sub tasks. I like the widget and how easy it is to mark a task as done, set deadlines and postpone tasks. It works wonderfully.",
I have used many task managers before and this one is by far the best. User friendly interface. Powerful widget with various view options. No drain on battery. Works in the cloud so access from everywhere. Syn is automatic and almost real time and it works great.,
"One of the best apps i have everywhere... helps me keep update on my projects and i have it in my phone, Chrome and firefox. Just awesome.",
"This is the best task app. I have found to date. I was a former premium user but I left to find something better. That was earlier this year and I have found it to be much better. I compare it to Nozbe and this wins. The one difference is the option to enter tasks using voice. Otherwise the widget, quick task, and labels are wonderful. I hope to upgrade to 5 star after using it more than three days.",
So far I like it... I use it for work since I am always losing my clipboard with my notes.... I really love the button that u can hit on a task to carry it over to the next day!!!,
when i use from laptop and sign in it is running fine but when i use this app on android then upon sign in unknown error occur and does not sign me in. please resolve.,
"I love todoist, and use it everyday. The android app could be smoother and faster. (for example, the widget doesn't update frequently enough, which makes it not too useful.)",
No reason to use this. My outlook offers same detail and is available on my desktop already! Waste of ap.,
"This looks like a great app, but currently crashes on my stock Nexus 5. Hope to see a fix soon!",
"This app made me so industrious. The karma system made me feel so... enlightened. I bought the premium version, they deserve every penny.",
What's this application good for when it doesn't synchronize with Google tasks. Uninstalling.,
Favorite part is ability to sync between phone and pc. Also clean smooth UI.,
Great app so pleased with the free version i paid for no adds.  Thank you,
"Of all the to do list apps I've tried, this is easily my favorite. Easy to use and versatile. Awesome work!",
Simple to use. Lots of functionality great way to help you keep on top of things,
"Maybe it would be nice to have the option that missed to-dos are moved to the current day and get a higher priority with every time they are missed, somthing like a priority based aging thing",
"No way I could keep up with the many tasks, chores and assignments that come with being a college student without the Todoist app!",
I love this app and its companion website. They are very flexible solutions for task management! They fit my working style so well that I paid for premium membership.,
A one line top-of-the-list widget would be great as the current one is too big for a phone.,
I don't use this app an awful lot but it is handy when I need it and works well,
"A little resource hungry for a to-do list app, but still the best.",
"Excellent app, works on many platforms (I use Android, Outlook and Gmail). Very intuitive. Premium features are worth the price. Only downside is it doesn't support sharing ""projects"" - you need to use ""wedoist"" do manage that.",
I'm forgetful & I'm a procrastinator so Todoist makes my life easier & more productive.,
Smart and easy application. For higher level planning recommend to add gant,
So much awesome. Just needs a better security policy.,
Can't go a day without jotting something on my phone on todoist. Syncs with my other devices too!,
This is really cool. I have my tasks on outlook as well as on the go. Good stuff.,
"Keeps me on track and up to date. Very simple to use, but powerful",
I love it. Tasks and Subtasks are so easy and shorthand for the timing of projects works out great.,
Widget is fantastic. Very customizable. There's room for improvement but it's the best out there.,
Great app. Worth supporting by buying premium to keep the app in development.,
Basic feature like reminder is not free.,
its good app .. but lacks option for task accomplished or delay,
"Fast, intuitive task adding, and great project hierarchy system.",
"Seamless integration to the Web app, clean and well executed interface.",
"Slick, easy to use, relatively intuitive. Major productivity boost.",
Love the fact that works on every possible os and browser.,
"Great app for organizing! Thanks, Todoist!",
Neat little app for managing projects at a high level.,
Simple to use and adds real value to organisation and take,
Love this app its so easy to use and has everything you could ask for in a todo list,
Gets you organised and gets things done.,
"Easy to use,  keeps me on task,  works with ALL of my devices (major plus).",
It really helped me manage school work i recomend this app,
And that's just the free edition. I will pay for this one.,
"I love this app, it keeps me consistent.",
I loveeee this apps. Using it everyday and now i think i cant live without it! :),
"Use it on my mac, pc, Samsung, gs4, ipad and iPhone... and also the Web. Just fantastic!",
Great & simple app for powerfull software!,
Excellent cross platform to-do application!,
Perfect for managing tasks across all platforms.,
Highly recommended for any level of organization.,
This app helped me. Thank you,

Finally a good to-do app,

Very good.. Note 2,
Only app I've ever paid for,
D'après moi ; c'est le mieux app de management de temp personneI,
The best to do app around,
"Excellent GUI. Simple, clean, and effective.",
Clean interface. Wonderful todo,
Push notification should be free and should not be a premium account only,
Does everything you would want a to do list to do in a way that you would want it to do it!,
Great software.   It is essential,
Really helpful.,
After updates all my data and saved notes deleted.,
"So good, so easy",
The best.,

"Habe bisher Any.Do benutzt, aber die Projekte haben mir gefehlt. Nicht kostenlos, aber preiswert. Kann aber ruhig bei Any.do noch etwas lernen, wg. Auto Completion der Ko ntakte und dem Nachfischen bei Terminen und Anrufen.",
"I have recently started using this and really like it... works to keep me focused on what I need to do and is not unwieldy to maintain tasks.  Only one problem - can't access options from the lock screen, despite having enabled them in settings :(  (using Galaxy Note 3).",
You have to go thru to many steps to just check off the priority level and then asks for date. Should be simpler one step. Also you have to buy upgrade for most options.,
Has intuitive UI. Everything is in the right place and works the way expected. I'm dependent on it.,
I use it in combination with their web app and gmail add-on. With Todoist I can focus on doing stuff instead of trying not to forget something.,
I was a big Astrid user and even they closed up shop I started looking. I wish I would've been using Todoist a long time ago! :-),
"I didn't like the email reminders, but its super simple to turn off whatever features you doing want. Best task list app I have found yet.",
"Exactly what I need. Simple, effective, offline support. Works perfectly.",
"Simply fantastic. The complete task management package: beautiful, easy to use, cross platform, and flexible. My only small complaint is the text size for the widget....it's huge!",
Good also to keep track on your list.,
Great extention to the web site,
Great app.,
Really enjoying the complimentary version!!!,
Indispensable!,
Big help with my daily tasks. ?..,
Nice app,
"Needs an undo option for accidental completions so I don't have to go an add the whole thing again. Also, if I complete a task late or simply forget to mark it done the day it's due, I don't mean that it's done for that day, just for the previous. Maybe add a do it today option on mobile app? Also, on repeated tasks for example I water my plants every Fri. If I mark it off Saturday & still plan on doing it Fri, it automatically moves it Saturday. If you could fix these things it would be great.",
"What's the point of a task management app if I can't set reminders? The free app is supposed to give a notification reminder 30 minutes before a task is due. Need it 10 minutes before? Forget it. You have to get a *paid* subscription to be able to set reminders in a flexible manner.  ""But you can try the paid version for 30 days. Don't like it? Just cancel. No harm no foul, right?"" Nope. It took me more than 30 days to find that Astrid randomly lost my tasks, and more than 30 days to find bugs in Wunderlist. Moreover, I wrote ""supposed"" above because when I twice tried to trigger a notification in the free app neither times did a notification show up. That sure inspires confidence in the paid service.",
"its a near perfect app, just had some issues. once half of my tasks got deleted and the other half had all their dates altered on its own. it was very annoying. also there should also be events like the tasks.",
"I hate Outlook - however - the Outlook plugin for Todoist finally solved my work task list problem. Love all of the other platform options. Very functional, good syncing. I like it enough that I might pay for the upgrade, which I generally never do for apps.",
"Todooist is the best app and service for handling tasks. It does everything I always wanted and were an issue for other apps (subtasks, notes, reminders...).",
You better give some features available to the users who don't want to upgrade.,
One comment. Not all taak appear does not with a due date are not in the list. Would be handy to are does tasje in an overview,
"Could use with some improved features such as easier integration with calendar,  ability to t track an email when it moves folders in outlook,  ability to display email contents in todoist app.   But overall a good simple to use app.",
Totally awsome todo app. Freestyle Mobility App dev. Agrees this is an awsome Todo app and we have tried a few. Pro is worth upgrade but regular is full of features you use. regular is full of features you use.,
Clean Holo UI and a love for adopting cats. You can't go wrong with this app. Great work guys.,
Was using Any.do before this and Todoist beats that with its minimalistic but intuitive design and cross platform integration (almost any platform). Superb product.,
Without this app I would simply stare at my office wall for 8  hours.,
"Its beautiful, a joy to use and most of all, it doesn't nag me all through the day. I really love the calendar integration as well. I've tried other to do apps and I have to say, this is the first one that's really gotten it right.",
"I've tested many of the big apps of this kind, but this was my choice, principally because the free version is completely sufficient, the folders inside folders and tasks inside tasks helps a lot with the organization, and you can use it everywhere (outlook, chrome, android, iOS...)",
Wondering if it's possible to export the todo list as a csv file? It will help in preparing for meetings with other stake holders.,
I tried about a dozen other similar applications before buying this. Great rich functionality.,
"A very nice and handy To do manager, easy to use, looks nice and works well!  Totally Recommended!!",
Great application to keep on track of your important tasks. Looking for a while application which can be uodated on handset and web as 0er requirement,

"I upgraded to Android about a year ago and have been missing Omnifocus for mobile. In the past year I've also been using OS X less and less, so my super powerful Omnifocus desktop application has been fading away. Most todo apps for Android are pretty ridiculous. I'm happy to see how this ubiquitous service is always in front of me regardless of computer or device. Also, being able to add contexts is huge for me, and this service integrates that.",
"Came back to Todoist after growing frustrated with other todo apps. Should never have left! It has every feature you could need, great shortcuts and a really simple UI. Perfect for organising big and small projects or just the everyday",
"This app gets out of your way so you can be on your way.   I think the premium price is a tad bit steep,  but worth it at the annual rate given the dedication to development and the excellent customer support. I am a fan after 2 days of the trial and will be signing up for a year.   Excellent work! Keep it up!",
"After using Astrid, Wunderlist and Due Today for quite a length of time each, I've finally settled on Todist and subscribed too. Each of these apps has a shortcoming and none are perfect, but this one works best for me. It syncs well across each of my devices, including the web, has contexts for GTD, is simple and fun to use, supports projects and indented or nested sub-tasks. Fantastic. The latest version has amazing functionality that is merely on the wish list of other to-do apps.",
I am excited to stumble upon todoist for it looks very promising. I thought it will be better than Any.do or Wunderlist. I love the labels options. Everything was fine except for the reminders which was really a HUGE let down. I have tried setting up reminders but none of them is showing up. It will be better if the reminders options are in the same page just like in Any.do. I am sorry that I had to give it 1-star (for now) due to its serious glitch in the reminder section.,
The UI and daily reminder are great. Still waiting for customisation of the default notification time. Also the default notification should appear during the creation of the task rather than requiring the task to be saved first before it appears and can then be edited. Also the snooze time should be selectable when the notification appears.,
really nice app to manage your schedule. better than most out there if not the best. what is missing is the ability to get reminders at chosen time of the day . n also some functionality shud be added to projects as well rest awesome,
"I love the android app, the minimalistic design and all its features. I even got the Chrome app extension since I go between my tablet and laptop a lot. It wasn't long until I came across the first bugs, involving the calendar. When I create a task on my laptop for Oct 31st, on my tablet it synchs as Nov 1st. When I go to change the date on my tablet, it doesn't work. When it does, the same task on my laptop doesn't reflect the change once synchronized. It gets really frustrating really quick. Why do all tasks I create on the website get bumped a day ahead on the android app? The timezones are the same on all platforms. Also, the sorting the tasks by date seems to work whenever it wants. I would really want to use ToDoist for both the personal and professional spectrums, I even wanted to go Premium, however its reliability right now worries me into avoiding it.",
"I've looked high and low for to do list apps, from Don't forget the Milk to Buy me a Pie, but this one takes the cake. Ingeniously intuitive design with a wonderful widget, nothing can compare. Keep it up guys.",
"I think there's a lot of stuff that is great with Todoist, but I'm worried about the fact that a lot of people have complained about how the inbox feature works for a while now but nothing has been done to remedy it. The general attitude of ""we're going to do what we think is best"" doesn't quite serve me as a customer.",
Have only used this app fpt few days now but it appears to be well designed. It is fairly user friendly. I would like more control of task notifications similar to anydo.,
"Amazing app. The ui is amazing and the comments that come up after the tasks are done are hilarious. Only thing that should be worked on is the widget. And is it possible to make it dark theme, or make a toggle to switch the theme. I hope the Dev can look into this. And also can you guys make a dashclock extension?",
"This is a very good basic application that will only get better! Many times I wished I had paper and pen to write down something I needed ""To Do"" and then I remembered my To Do List Application and the task is saved.",
Free version does everything i need but i'm still considering going premium. Synchronization with chrome plugin is awesome.,
"I have memory problems since my brain surgery, at it was the greatest programme to download to assist me.  It tells me online and on the phone what I have plsnned during the day.  Great purchase.",
"You can't even set a reminder without in-app purchases. Don't waste your time with this so-called free app. Besides, they spam you with emails.",
I like the app its very useful for a lazy bum like me. But would be great to have few more of the paid features in the free version as well.,
Seems a nice app but it doesnt display words correctly. They appear to me as many black squares as the letters contained in word. Samsung S3,
"A good and useful app, but the absence of some useful features from the free version is disappointing.",
"Great but wish you could send reminders of tasks to others via email or sms	Great but wish you could send reminders of tasks to others via email or sms.  This feature would make it a 5 hands down!",
"Sends emails even when notifications are turned off,  wastes effort on pointless karma score,  nice to do features spoiled by useless features",
"I love Todoist & the app is great. Very fast & easy to use.   I just wish it had the option to move to the SD card. No big deal for most people I'm sure, but essential for phones with limited storage space.",
I have used countless task management systems. So far this is the one that really fitted my workflow and I really enjoyed using.  Kudos!,
A very well designed to-do app. The widget is very functional and useful. But the reminder notifications don't always appear,
Todomanager without reminders is useless. When an app does not have free or light in it's name I expect full functionality.,
As a busy guy this app really helps me to keep track of my work. Its really simple and user friendly. Recommend to anyone who needs to organize their day,
"Very professional layout allows for sorting under multiple project and sub-project headings. Includes labelling options for sorting by other criteria (such as who you delegated to). Synchronization across phone, tablet web pages and desktop works great.",
"It provides access from different types of gadgets I use, which is very helpful. However, ability to update the list right from the widget and some options to personalize widgets could be great.",
This app has great potential but I cannot justify spending $5 a month for an app that works basically the same as many free apps. I would pay maybe $3 one time fee for premium.,
"Didn't like the price neither the use ease. The only good point it's task done metrics, all the rest is like the average apps.",
"I want to love this app, but not being able to see my previously done tasks in the free version is a big no in my book. Why should I have to shell out a monthly fee to access my own data?",
I put all of my class assignments here so I only have one place to look. I wish the app version allowed you to see your completed tasks like online. Sometimes I click complete when I'm not.,
Not bad.. I liked the simplicity of this app ;) but I couldn't find where to set up my todoist to order by date. Now its sorting on creation date but not when I marked ;)),
This is a wonderful organizational app. It can be used as a simple task manager or a more powerful task manager/list maker that has several advanced functions. This is a highly recommended app.,
"It's a cool application, it always help me have my stuffs done in time. Its a must get",
Remind you everydays task moreover task left undone in past days. Worth to install it. Nice job....,
"It wold be great that each task could have a note space to write the details of said task (i know notes it's a feature of the full version, but i believe it would be a nice touch) nevertheless. It runs perfectly.",
Helps me stay on top if getting things done. Like that I can see how productive I am being!  Keeps me motivated!,
The application doesn t have any  added value that justify to buy based on free version.,
"Between work, home, and when I am on the move - Todoist keeps my priorities in order and gives me access wherever I am. This tool has become part of my everyday life.",
A great app to keep you on track if you are prone to procrastination. Slightly glitchy on my slower phone but overall excellent,
"Fast, responsive, intuitive. Only complaint is the widget won't update unless I open the app.",
My daily notifications include completed tasks from up to ~5 days ago. Extra star for customer service though!,
I found this and im still trying it but it seems i will hire the service. I have found this very useful,
Fantastic app! Synchronizes with desktop version too so you can keep track of all your to-dos at home and away.,
"I've used Astrid, Wunderlist, Things, 2Do and others. This is by far the best task manager app I've ever used.",
A little more flexibility on widget theming (read transparency) would be appreciated.,
I think this app is better than the native Gmail  app.  I like the name of this app as well.  The push notifications are just amazing and I think,
"Good features, nice UI easy to integrate into my daily routine. I recommend it.",
"My wife no longer has to ask if I did something.  She just asks ""once"" if it's on my Todoist.  Very good app!",
Really enjoying using this apps. Definately comes at the top in terms of UI. Kudos to developers for the same.,
"I use it for my work and personal task lists. I use the phone app, tablet app, iPad and on my work laptop via Chrome. Love it!",
"This application is great, seamlessly syncing with the cloud.  Design follows Android guidelines very well",
Tried many others but this is the only one I've been able to get into,
"Perfect mix of simplicity & power.  I use it every day, and love it.",
No more forgetting stuff! I simply add it to my list as I remember things thruout the day! Yay!,
"It works...does what it's supposed to. Still not my perfect idea of a ""To Do"" app. But good.",
However for me the subscription model for premium is way overpriced which is needed to really make it useful.,
"I am still enjoying the trial version, but I am buying it for sure! It is worthy! If only the premium version had more features ...",
A simple yet fully featured to-do app. Sync option is great!,
"Very nice app,  but why do I need to pay $4/month for featured other equally nice apps do for free? I could justify $2, but not $4 just for my task list. Let me know when there is a sale.",
"This app is very nice and easy to use, with powerfull function.",
Why the hell you want to access my google account? or wanting me to sign in? I already have too many user names and passwords in my life!! The last thing I want is a todo list login info.,
It's very useful and the interface is very clear. If you are a advanced user you should buy the premium version!,
"It's fast and intuitive, yet powerful enough for either GTD or simple use. Widget is also functional. Looks so pretty on my Xperia ZL. One suggestion: Dark skin please?",
"Works excellent on Galaxy Note 2, website, and in outlook",
Thanks for creating such useful app. I really like it..,
Best to do list app I have ever tried. And I have tried a lot.,
Its an amazing app . I could finally organize my time,
"Easy to use, lots of features, clean design, great on web and Android app.",
Truly life changing.,
Does what it says it do. Your not going to regret downloading it,
Been looking for something like this for a long time. Love it,
A great tool to keep you on track and focused to get more done!,
This is a very easy to use app that does exactly what it says it does. I use it daily.,
Helps me keep track of everything I have to do,
I have tried all the major task apps and this is one of the best.,
Need some more time with app. Like the outlook integration,
It is very easy to use and provides quick entries which I love,
Way too much $ for an app that does nothing more than other free to do apps.,
This app works virtually flawless.,
I like its reminders of over due tasks.,
"Slick and useful, i can honestly reccomend this app.",
"Good. Can key in info through pc, tablet and phone. And update anytimes.",
I really love it and its so easy to use...,
Far too expensive for a to do list,
Helpfull for me..thanks,
Well worth the coffee a day for Premium.,
Great. Thanks,
Excelent job. Does what I need it to do,
"The best task management app, hands down",
Useful app to manage personal task,
Good aap useful on Travel,
Has just about everything,
Works very well and looks nice!,
A bit typical to operate,
"I love it: simple, easy, efficient and GTD compatible.",
User friendly. Works well with my N2.,
Useful tips via email,

Perfect for my mobile,
Clean UX and sync between devices,
Nice little app that does the job.,
Good app to organize our schedule,
Very good for organizing daily task,

"Very good, and working well on my gadget....   But unfortunately it is without reminder...cause reminder is only on paid version...he he...  Success for team!  Regards, MT",
"nice app, it helped me manage my stuffs.THANK YOU^O^",
Can't find why do i have use it cause it doesn't sync google calendar,

It is highly helpful !,

Hi,
"I created a project, write a task and put the date. When I click done mark, it suddenly crashed.",
"Sync really helps keep things together across home pc, phone and work pc.",
"Nice app that does everything I want. Easy to put in my daily, weekly or monthly tasks.",
We have to use internet just for this it is realy annoying because I do not always use internet,
Goes about doing its job perfectly.,
"The app itself is nice looking and functional... But only really functions the way most people want if you pay the ridiculous monthly fee. There's better out there for free, and even if they start charging... Sorry, but unless you only plan to use the service for a few months, there are many paid options out there that give equal or better value for the price. Uninstalling, regretfully.",
"I've tried them all over the last three years, and had pretty much given up.  Todoist is the closest I've found to perfection.  It's ridiculously well thought out.  And the widget is incredible.",
"I have tried them all. While everyone is looking for different things from a task manager, Todoist provides enough flexibility that you can add your own structure and views of your tasks, and it looks great. Simply fantastic.",
"App appears excellent but pretty useless for me because I don't know how to sync with MS Office reminders, otherwise this app would have been ideal for me. Please advise.",
"Increase Number of subtasks, better review feature. Love the karma points. Also it would be nice if we could Select Multiple tasks for drag & drop.",
Beautiful interface plus the ability to sync with almost any platform make this my new app for tasks.,
"OK. I've been playing around with it for a few days. It's easy to use and I'm starting to like it. A lot. The only thing I don't like? Having to pay for the premium features (advanced labeling, etc.) I'd like to have them, but I don't need the sms/email. Maybe a paid version with all the extras except sms/email would be good. 5 stars of you make it!!!",
Very use full and really great in use. Best planner app for me so far. Thank you.,
"About a week ago I was in the market looking for a app that I would be able to use not only as a to-do list, but as a task manager with calander aspects as well. Todoist filled that role.",
I just had to write about this amazing app! too. 5 stars,
"Finally someone figured it out.  This is very intuitive and organizes tasks in a simple and effective manner. Easil editable, changeable and syncs seamlessly over all devices.  I love it!",
"Nice app and service, but the app doesn't seem to sync automatically (be it in the background or when I launch the app), which seems like a basic feature to me. Two days after I've marked a task as done on the web, the same task is still marked as ""to do"" in the app, and I continue to receive a daily reminder for this task --until I press the sync button in the app. Please fix.",
I love this app I love the fact that it emails you reminders of things to do easily checking them off when the completed.,
"All decent features are locked to premium, and upgrade is a monthly/yearly fee, which I don't think any app is worth. I will stick to a free account with Evernote it's much better.",
"Really useful to get things done. And it works everywhere: android, web, Thunderbird, windows app, and more.",
Always on track now with homework and things I need to do around the house. I love this app!,
Simple but not complicated. Generous but not superfluous. Pretty straightforward and keeps you organized.,
"Beautifully designed, but not worth ""one coffee"" per month. I'd gladly pay for an app I like, but I won't subscribe to a monthly fee.",
It's really cool it gives you just enough in the free version to make it really useful and effective,
Works well share between android phone and website on Windows pc,
Integration with Google Calendar requires a premium account.,
"Very useful, email reminders are great..",
It keeps me organized,
"Manual sync you said..? Even Evernote or GTask free services DOES the automatic sync across all platform, you know that..?!?!!?!? Forget it, I'll uninstall..",
It keeps me organized.,
Download GTasks.. free and much better. Reminders don't cost extra.. uninstalling!,
Don't go anywhere else for to do list...,
Just awesome!!,
Great self management tool,
Great tool,
World's as advertised.,
GOOD,
Mensalidade muito cara,
First let me mention: The potential of  TODOist is amazing. I have seen online how people are using it and it's awesome. And for how it CAN be used clearly deserves 5 stars.   But coming to this free membership that is being being reviewed here. Well lets just say is very limited. They have reserved all the power features that make this simple app awesome only for the premium subscription. I can't even simply view all task at a glance. Leave alone trying to get to applying tags or custom filtering.,
I love the fact that the so is not obtrusive or pushy with notifications. The premium features are brilliant. You should consider giving free users 3 labels and limited reminder functionality (1 reminder for all tasks in a day or something),
"I am a former Remember the Milk user and I can honestly say this platform is in another league. It handles everything I throw at it and makes me much more productive day after day. The team behind the tools are great, very prompt with support and suggestions.  The Karma score is really unique and definitely keeps me focused in keeping my list clean and up-to-date. Not only is it satisfying to see the score climb, but in the bigger picture it is an added confirmation that stuff is not slipping.   Well Done!",
"Made the switch as Todoist has connection to Android, Outlook and Windows. Little quirky in the syntax but seems to be adding features monthly. Unlimited indents of tasks & subtasks was the kicker. Would love an easy way to import my Toodledo tasks but can't have everything! Highly recommended for task and list junkies.!!",
"Very useful to do list. Clean, simple and just enough features! Love that I can access my lists via chrome and my Android",
Love ToDoist!,
Handy and systematic,
Great,
"Great app with a lot of features hidden under a simple interface. Only disappointed in the lack of consistency of these features across platforms - most notably the missing saved filters on the web version, and the confusing undocumented bug where 'or' doesn't work properly on Android filters.",
"Thoughtful app that is well complimented by online services. Looking forward to further refinement, but already Todoist is at the top of the pile.",
I wish it would sort by priority and if it was overdue I could get a 2n d reminder time.,
Really good stuff. So good in thinking of buying a plexpass. That way I can arrange for some of my media to be cached on the tablet for offline viewing. Neat.,
"I tried a number of list keeping mechanism including other apps and to todoist is far and away the best. Powerful, intuitive and extremely flexible.",
I have been a premium user for 2 years and this app is incredible. I love it and will keep using it!,
The only flaw in this app is the time window. It takes too much time and steps to choose the time and date. If this app will use the new time window from Google calendar it would be perfect.,
This is a very good app.  Exact what I needed.  The UI could be improved a little bit to make it more intuitive and consistent among the app and the web interface.,
This app is great looking and is very easy to use. I run many projects and this system (app and website) helps me keep track of each project and add tasks that aren't project related. If there was a free trial to start with then it would be great.,
I think that this is the best task management app so far but i really don't like how there's a monthly or yearly fee to get the premium version. It would be better if there was a one time fee that lasts for a lifetime then i'd definitely pay.,
"I have used a lot of to do list applications and Todoist is the best. Highly recommended! Pay for the premium and use it with Outlook, Chrome and Windows",
Works well but competing against similar products. Pro version @ $30 is way over the top,
"Having used it for a couple of weeks, I really like it as it is cross platform and dependable. The one hangup I am still having is that the entries do not end up in date order unless I move it from the bottom to its place of occurrence. Any suggestion?  I have tons of entries and this hassle is frustrating.",
I've tested a lot of productivity apps. This one beats them all and is multi platform so I have access no matter where I am.,
Don't really need this.  Already have calendar and keep.  Those already take care of my needs.,
"Helps me focus and clearly define my priorities, and acts as a guiding star all day long. Thank you, Todoist!",
"Et ce défaut c'est l'absence de tri manuel. Ce dernier ne fonctionne que dans certaines listes et uniquement si aucune tâche dans la liste n'a reçu d'attribut de priorité. C'est exaspérant. Dans une app de ce niveau, et quand on paye pour la version premium, c'est incompréhensible. Après avoir désespérément essayé de m'y faire, j'ai abandonné et suis retourné à MLO. Dommage car pour le reste Todoist est brillant.",
Easy to use on all my devices/computers. Keeps me on track!,
A really useful app - I use the google chrome app on my laptop and on my phone!,
This is a very useful app that I have used more and more.,
Great app.  Works great for my job and simple organization.,
Great app for tracking to do items.,
Platform for team sharing would help.,
Syncs perfectly. Easy to use.,
Right level of functionality.,
Nice app.,
Want I needed a****,
Absolutely marvelous.,
Need some amilioration,
Good,
"I've lost count of the number of apps I tried before settling on this one. Cross-platform functionality was non-negotiable for me and this app works on all of my devices.  Categories and sub-tasks were also must-haves and this handles them pretty well.  The only noteworthy downside is that I have to manually synch each device. It's not hard, but it should be automatic. Still, I'll be buying the full version.",
"Nice app, but too basic. I'd love to have the ability to create lists within tasks, so I can create a task like ""buy"" and then have a shopping list attached. Also I would love to have tasks without due date, to do them at my earliest convenience.",
Works great and isn't bogged down by useless bells and whistles. Todoist combines the simplicity of a paper task list with the power of a cloud-based syncable productivity app.,
If I can train myself to utilize the free app as it is intended I will be purchasing the full app.  Easy to use and finctional.,
"I'd like to be able to see my karma in the app :-) but not hidden away in a menu. It'd be cool if you could see the karma flowing in whenever you earned some :-)  it shouldn't be obtrusive though, subtlety would do the trick, but make it so so you can check more about your karma and graph in the app itself. The previous",
I needed a replacement for Astrid after Yahoo decided to kill it...Todoist more than fits the bill.,
"I have used about a dozen productivity apps, but Todoist is my favorite. It's easy to use, yet it's full featured and powerful. So, my search for the right productivity/planning app according to my needs is over!",
Great app. But notifications and reminders could use some improvement,
So far a very good experience.,
The porential to get organized really wxcites me,
"Nice redesign, needs location based reminders.",
"Love it! Easy, simple & helpful!",
So far so good.,
It's usefull,
Clean Fast app,
"Nice clean design and powerful features make Todoist comparable to RTM and the likes. RTM app crashes on my phone so I'm using this instead.  Edit: Tried to put in ""Every 7th of the month"" and it just doesn't recognises it. No way of inputting recurring monthly tasks due to this. Uninstalled. Using Wunderlist.",
"Probably one of the simplest tools that I've used. One of the main pain in not using a personal task assistant is the complexity involved in raising and managing tasks.   Pleasantly, this app presents a non-intrusive clean interface that's a breeze to work with..  Well done!",
This app does exactly what it says.  It is easy to use and now I don't have to wonder where I left my list.,
"It's the best to-do app I've used so far, but I really miss the ability to see all of the tasks of the projects in one screen, as we can see in the site, that we have this option by putting all of the projects inside the ""Inbox"".",
Simply the best to do package available anywhere on any (and all) platforms. I'm just thrilled with it. Get the premium subscription and unleash your productivity.,
"The first app that I've deemed useful enough to tempt me into spending the annual fee for premium access, I guess the next real test will be if I renew!",
"Great mobile version of the todoist website. Their online support is very prompt and helpful, and there is a votebox online to request new features.  When mine is implemented I'll give it five stars ;)",
I've tried every task manager out there. This is the best one so far.,
"Moved from Omnifocus to this. Excellent sync, and fits perfectly with my GTD work flow. Great app guys.",
I've tried everything else. And this app by far is the best one.,
Notifications don't work.   Only syncs when you open the app.  Otherwise it's OK.,
Great App!,
Does not syn between phone and tablet. Don't waste your time.,
The recurring task feature is excellent and the app itself is beautifully designed with many useful features,
I tried several apps and this is just the best one.,
"Simply the BEST app for managing time and reminders....I in all honestly can not have an accomplish and successful day if i don't use this app...half my day am working from outlook ....having the plugin for outlook Hugh plus...If you are really looking manage , plan and get truly organise you should gave this app a try...",
So easy to use. What a wonderful app!,
I have tried others but this is a keeper.,
I've tried lots. This one is easily the best.,
Best cross platform to-do list manager,
Best to do list app available,
Best in use Best in funtioning,
"Easy, simple to do list",
Great with GTD!,
Simple and perfect.,
anyway to make it sync with Google calendar ? Would be perfect,
Use it everyday,
Okie dokie,
I've tried many To Do List / Task Managers and ToDoist is the only one on every platform that meets my needs.,
"Changed to 5 stars. I got a free premium trial and love the features. With custom search filters and context labels, I am able to setup tasks perfectly with the GTD methodology. I was hesitant to buy it based on what I saw in free version, but the free premium trial convinced me its well worth the fair yearly subscription cost.",
"I wish there was a dark theme. But I'd really rather have a way for this app to notify me when a task is up. Apparently that will cost me four bucks a month. There's too many apps that perform this basic, necessary function for free. I don't see what's so special that I need a recurring fee draining my wallet. On to the next...",
"The app looks amazing. I've always loved the minimalist design of todoist, and this app certainly reflects that. I also love how the newer app makes it easier to set up reminders. The only thing I'm would like to see is search function (correct me if I'm wrong). Great job Todoist!",
"A few data points don't appear available (yet? :) ) on the tablet, but I just wrote a few scripts against their sync API to grab the data I needed. I also wrote a service for syncing between Todoist and an enterprise level project management offering with ease.  Newest 2.0 Update made some really strange changes for those who are used to 1.0. Change is fine, having to click three extra times to add labels to a new task I am creating is a bad UX design (when this was default before).",
There is no need to have to sign in to use this app. I wonder what information is shared or stored.,
"Only have the free version, but works well and good web interface for pc as well. Considering buying to get task priority and some other niceties",
"Hi, devs.  1. Notification doesn't work if you set up date and time for any events;  2. Make ability to open app via the widget. For now there is only option to edit chosen item or add new one; 3. Develop ""Complete"" panel so user could see his ""done"" tasks  That's why you've got 3 stars :(  You'll get your 5 if you fix the list above.",
"Just downloaded and so far I've used this to do app longer than a day which is more than I can say for most of this type. It's easy, convenient and also easy to use on my computer while in school (which I can't say about my phone app since we're not allowed to use phones in class)! Hopefully it will continue to be something I actually use.",
"Really a cool app, install it. Works good in my Micromax  canvas 2",
The 2.0 version is a great improvement. Looks beautiful and works great.,
"Tried and paid for various services,  save yourself time and money and just go with Todoist.",
good,
"I love this app. I used it a lot on my nexus 7 and more that I have it fixed again, I still use it a lot. So, I was happy to wake up to an email today alerting me to the release of an iPad optimized version of this. There not enough great organizational apps that are cross platform between these two. Edit: my Nexus 7 was on the fritz today, but it finally turned on. I was excited to see the update they'd emailed me about. The new UI is even more spectacular than the previous.  can't wait for iPads turn!",
"it's the best for me - good apps, great plugins, simple interface, robust and intuitive. And the Karma system keeps me active!  There's nothing as elegant and capable as this that I've found, and I've tried just about all of them.  One feature I would like is a bulk upload/download feature so I can build gantt charts and project management docs in excel from task data and export them back to todoist; but it's not a biggie.",
"Haven't really used it enough so far to give it 5*, but putting in information is really quick and easy for me. A good range of usable options when deciding how you need the software to communicate with you. I like it a lot so far. 4*",
"Really good app over all. One issue: wish I had the ability to remove the ""add task"" button on the pull down ribbon.",
The new update has made me start using this again. So far I'm getting things done at a much quicker pace then before.,
New ui is great. Clean and simple view with plenty of power that pops up contextualy as you use it.,
I had this as a 5 star now a 2.  Update has made swiping off done items in the app too difficult.  Have to swipe 3-5 times every time I want to swipe off a done task.  Please fix.,
"Never before have I written a review, but this is the best, most intuitive, most straightforward app you could ever look for. Plus, the aesthetics are on point and it makes organizing a cinch. Thank you for providing this....for free!",
This app actually makes me complete everything I have to do! So simple and everything syncs so I remember my tasks everywhere I go!,
Excellent I wish I'd found this app years ago.,
"After trying so many different todo apps, I've finally settled on this new version of todoist. The true test of a todo app..... Is it easy to add items? and do you find it fun to use? So far so good. It can be as simple as you need it to be yet it can also suit your more advanced todo requirements as you need them. New redesign is very pleasing visually.",
"Ty God for someone who knows about functionality and, most important, DESIGN!",
Unless you pay $28.00 yearly  Hell no!  I will continue to use Any.DO and guess what?? I pay NOTHING yearly and its synced across all my devices and pc's,
Is it just a tease that you send me an email with a free upgrade for the new app and I can't install it? What's up with that?,
Great app,
ALL OF MY LIST IS GONE,
"I hav been looking fr sumthing like this since long,  the variety of devices i can sync wid is overwhelming..  The free account lets u do sooo much. I love this app and is my default app and definitely will sugest my friends.. Pls dnt modify plans in future.... Thanks a ton",
"I really enjoy using this app. It has a slight learning curve in the beginning which is soon over come thanks to the handy tutorial mode. My only issue is a BIG one; for any to-do list app there should be a reminder with both the date and time. Unless I've completely missed something I can only set a date (just plain weird). Overall, thanks for creating such an awesome app.",
"Cant easily delete task. *Deleted  Needs more Natural Language support ie.. You should be able to enter in your task with time in one sentence and the app sets it all up. Example: ""Work tomorrow at nine"". The app should set a reminder for the next day at 9 am.   Ok with better/easier alternatives.",
"I was a big fan of Got To Do and its integration with Toodledo, but since Got To Do has been abandoned, I needed a replacement. I started playing with Todoist. Once I purchased the subscription, I realized it is more than worth it.  I wish there was more flexibility setting the default screen, and that there was integration with Executive Assistant (or that Todoist's widget wasn't butt ugly). Otherwise, I am very happy.",
"I could see rating this higher after I have a little more time using it. Very clean design consistent with current Holo guidelines. Multi platform support is huge plus, sync works well.  After using for a couple weeks, I'm bumping my review up to 5 stars. App works great, premium service has been worth it. Glad I made the switch.",
"Great app, use it at work all the time. Have one small gripe - every task I add goes directly to the bottom of the pile. Would be nice if we could see them on top of the list before we choose to reorder it.",
I discovered this app when looking for a cross platform task app. Very pleasantly surprised by its functionality. I can sync Android phone with my Mac and Ipad and the sync works flawlessly. The app will also sync with web and windows for people who need that. Premium features like file Attachments and a email into task list function are $29 a year and are well worth it if you are using for business - a little over $2 a month for a Powerful business tool is a no brainer. Far better than Things or Wunderlist,
"Nice app, decent interface and it does what it is supposed to do.. I think it could use a tutorial or a better one if there is one already.. I remember being a bit confused at first. Also I appreciate the karma system but it could benefit from a better implementation of gamification.",
"I came from Astrid.  Totally impressed with the simple and clean look and feel of this app (both the desktop and the Android UI), while still able to do all the good stuff (email to task, drag and drop, etc).  Awesome.  Thanks",
I was using a third party app for a while and it didn't have the functionality that the todoist app has. I'm very pleased they developed their own. Now I can do all the same functions on my computer and phone!,
This is the best to-do list I've found. The only thing I don't like is that the sort option for today changes the order of my list every day. I wish it would just stay in the order I specified.,
Great app. A little quirky at times but they are constantly making improvements. So many ways to sort and prioritize!,
"I use ToDoIst on my phone and on my Chrome browser (desktop and laptop) - no matter where I am or what I'm doing, it helps me keep organized fast and efficient. Daily reminders keep me on track, plus the browser version allows URLs to be saved as tasks for review.",
"A great to do app for those looking for an Astrid replacement. Lack of reminders and calendar is a downer but with sub-tasks, criticality ranking and cross-platform synching, it's hard to fault. Give her a go",
"A quality app, which is quick to use. Cannot access completed items though, but I gather it's on the list.",
Would get a five from me if it would retain date sort order after you make adjustments to your list...,
Great for to do lists on per project basis. Reoccurring tasks and contexts arw a plus.,
I really enjoy using this on my nexus tablet. Now I have my todoist list everywhere with me. One suggestion is that i would like to add reminders easily,
This is a great productivity app that works solid on the Android platform.  Very simple to use but still powerful.  Highly recommended.,
Closest thing functionality-wise to Outlook's tasks on Android I've found.  Definitely worth paying for the premium features as well.,
Great clean GUI. Sync puts it a cut above all other to do list apps I checked out,
Really great app.  Only thought so far is that it would be nice to have the a low priority notification that wouldn't show up in the status bar all the time.  But I'm really liking it so far!,
"Works great for me on my Galaxy note 2 and my Windows 7 desktop. Thanks guys! Free is nice, but the upgrade is even better.",
Love this as a tool to manage my tasks in many different areas. The sync to the web version is a little buggy but I use this every day and love it!,
Works brilliantly but shame on needing to pay for basic syncing,
Would have given 5 stars if there was option of calendar and task time provision within app. What I liked abt it is options to create as many project list. Scope to improve UI. Also pls think on adding more customizable widgets.,
"I'm really enjoying manage my tasks using phone, web and Outlook(outlook has some tricks to install). Usability is great and the sync works well. I would like to see the capability to share/delegate task to another user, delegate quick tasks to my girlfriend and vice-versa would be awesome!",
Love the way it syncs with my gmail and outlook email accounts.  Its ability to list tasks a week at a glance and the project the task is assigned d to is invaluable and no other app does it as well.,
Have tried a few different task lists and like thus one the best.  Delighted to find the app for my new android phone.  Works without a hitch.,
Good app! Would be great if we can keep a track of finished task for some duration in the app itself. May be a week's time to see the accomplishments.,
"Simple, easy to use and covers all basic funcionality. Offline support, widget and sync with Windows client and web is awesome.",
"There may be a few features that I might like them to add,  but the Karma score is unique in my experience and is a fab motivator for folk like me trying to improve their productivity and integrity.",
"after an upgrade that allowed for syncing for free users, the free version is now the same as mobile website in functionality. There is still no sorting by priority in project view, so unless you put deadlines on everything, you cannot sort on the mobile",
Would be nice if parent task details also show in today view to avoid adding duplicate text to understand what task is about.,
I've been through a lot of task organizing apps and this one is by far the best.,
Best todo app on all platforms !,
Would love a better way to interact with many projects simultaneously.,
I've tried several task managers and this is my favourite so far.,
Very use full app. Would appreciate it if the website provides a pdf documentation about how to use it.,
If this has recurring items I'd be in heaven.,
Excellent for making projects do-able. Helps you prioritize and rewards you for completing.,
"I use it to keep track of my personal and work tasks, and even use the web version on my computer.",
Best way to never forget your essential tasks,
"Works flawlessly. Great way to organize your day, week, or whatever you need.",
It is helpful to let me plan my next action.,
Just what I was looking for.,
I wish I could add notes and time task is due,
"Awesome! Just what I was looking for-quick,easy and no nonsense.",
Love this app. Makes my life so much easier.,
Really need an app that will allow me to assign tasks to my wife like Astrid,
Aesthetically pleasing but minimalistic task management app.,
best part is that it is cross platform,
"Too early to give 5 stars, but so far I would say it's the best to-do app I've tried... and I've tried a LOT! I only wish the premium features were not so expensive!!! ...and also that they weren't based on a subscription.",
I've tried a lot and there is not much this can't do.,
"wszystko gra, najlepsza apka do zadań jakiej używałem:)",
Very easy to use,
Helps a lot.....,
Fabulous!,
Perfect!,
I love it,
Fully recommended,
Better flow,
Love it!!,
Working great.,
Gets the job done!,
Thanks!,
and very useful,
Nice clean app,
excellent app for productivity,
Love it.,
Works great,
Simple to use,
The Best,
Awesome,
"Hello, I am looking for an Astrid alternative and found this app. However, this app is missing one feature, assigning task to friend. Hope you guys will include this in the next update. :)",
Get it done,
Esta es la mejor app de organización que he encontrado. Tengo como un mes usando ToDoist de manera centralizada y ya no la cambio por otra.  Es sencilla de usar y al mismo tiempo ofrece buena y clara granulación para los proyectos más complejos.,
Needed recurring task function.  updated- can recur but no choice for after completion or due date. Ability to postpone admirable but not practical as not given choice of how long to postpone for. Uses google account to log in but does not seem to sync-none of my Google Tasks came through. Blank TD account,
"Since the developers fixed the syncing problems I have upgraded my rating and gone back to using this app because no other to do app that I have found is as good. This app is extraordinarily useful for helping me keep up with a very busy work and personal life.  It is an essential tool that I use every day. I love the clean, simple interface and I especially love the Chrome extension that helps me easily keep up with my to do lists right from my browser.",
"It is a simple and suprisingly effective assistant for getting things done. You can organize your tasks into projects, and break anything down into smaller, indented, sub-tasks complete with priority levels. The free version is sometimes a bit TOO restrictive and the app sometimes ""proactively slams those restrictions in your face"" too much for comfort. That said, being able to access this to-do list from any of my devices more than offsets this. I would consider a purchase if I were in task management.",
"The simple interface is almost misleading as to how powerful the search and overall usefulness of this app really is but this combination makes this my favorite to do app. Definitely recommend to anyone. My one and only problem is not it's fault at all but I can't access the website from behind the firewall at my work computer. Ugh, this makes it more difficult for me personally. :-\",
"A great way to keep track of your tasks across all your devices. The app isn't perfect but it's pretty darned good. Would be good if it didn't need to reload tasks every time it's run, and if the '7 days' view included overdue tasks like the web view does. But overall, it's really good, especially in view of the fact that it's free!",
"Quite simply the best out there; quick and easy to use yet powerful and feature rich. If only every app were like this...  Really don't understand the whining, freeloading cry baby reviews for this. It's well worth the money. Review it low if you don't like the app but don't put others off because you are too tight to pay a small fee to stay organised",
"The only feature I'm not fully satisfied with is a UX for hierarchical task structures. List view doesn't clearly shows level of hierarchy and task interdependencies, especially if subtasks are planned for several days.",
"I've tried almost every task app available over the past 4-5 years but never, until now, found one I really *wanted* to use. As someone who is highly disorganized and has procrastinated since childhood, it's been hard finding an app that I wanted to open. Todoist has an interface that I like, that I want to play with, and that is simple to use. It's not cluttered, and it makes finding, viewing, and editing my tasks easy. Being able to view tasks on the Android, iOS (haven't tried that yet), AND the web is a nice feature. I did upgrade to the premium feature after playing with the app for a while, mainly for the reminders, the notes, and the productivity graph. I expect this is going to be *the* to-do app I actually use on a daily basis. At some point in the future I'd like to see weekly exports of tasks sent via email, but I still love the app just as it is.",
I used several to do list apps and I think it is the best. It seems like I am going to upgrade my account.,
The app is simple so there's virtually no learning curve. It's also quite flexible to adapt to different workflows. Overall great user experience.,
"This app does everything I want a to-do list to do, easily sort things into days without wanting to know when in the day I'm supposed to do it. The whole program is intuitive and the tutorial is not obnoxious.",
"This is a neat application but I am running into some roadblocks, partly because of how I am trying to use it as a broad brush Project Task tool. There's a lot of good things to say about it, but in the interest of brevity I will list the things I wish were different:  1. Management of projects and sub-projects is a bit ham fisted and two many clicks are required to make basic structural changes  2. Sharing is not well supported and I ended up just using a separate user id for work and sharing it and it's password with my colleagues. No integration with Wedoist.  3. Exporting data, for example for import into a project plan structure or a word document, is not at all supported in the free version and it's not clear if it's supported in the paid version by somehow Jerry rigging it off backups  4. The website is not very clear on what Premium actually offers; so I have not bought it even though I would if I actually KNEW it was really going to meet my needs",
"Between the Web app and android app,  todoist is an excellent service that doesn't get mentioned alongside Astrid,  rtm, or trello like it should .  I pay for the premium service even though the free one is almost fully functional.  Nested items,  projects,  @ tags,  and priority labels are great features",
By far the sleekest looking tool I've ever seen which has a great deal of functionality as well. Simply the best option available on market IMHO.,
"Functional and readable, ToDoist is just the latest goal setting and project management app I've tried. It's not as intuitive as it could be, but the develop seems bright and responsive to this product's demographic.",
Todoist has really put serious thought into what you need to keep track of the things you need to do. So far I haven't found anything that I would change.,
Perfect cut down and easy to use simple todo list generator... you always have acess with the app or the website,
As a former Astrid user this is a good substitute but not as full -featured or user friendly. I'm sure the paid version would better suit my needs but don't like it enough to pay.,
"Genius - strikes the right balance between features and usability. Clever enough, but also accessible.",
"Todoist is now in my top 10 favorite apps. One of the best features is that my lists and projects sync between my laptop, phone and tablet, plus there is a really amazing chrome extension.   Love it. Frees up my mind, cause I just add a task and add it to a project and chose a due date and voila.",
After a long search for To Do app that really helps I discovered Todoist. I've been using it for almost a year and just keeps getting better. I have it as Google Chrome extention as well as on my phone and tablet. Keeps me focused and up to date with the many tasks of running my business. Highly recommended.,
Update: sync issues are fixed. starting to like it despite the occasional bugs on some platforms.,
Good app with nice design. Just need to iron out a few bugs.,
I would rate this as a decent app which does almost everything in free version . I would like to have a feature where I can add tasks to todoist directly from gmail or outlook.,
"Everything about this app is great, the only thing I don't like is the subscription business model.",
Im on my phone more than my computer so it is great to be able to do everything on here. Cant live without push notifications,
only one thing i would love to recommend is if we can adjust the event time which is at default 1hour it will be awesome.,
Excellent task manager/scheduler! I switched from another software and I love this one! Only downside is not being able to have an option to switch to a calendar view format when I need to see my busy month at a glance.,
"This is a simple, clean, user friendly interface that works on Desktop and Androis with no complications.  I love this.  Exactly exactly what I wanted.  Deleting other complicated project program with no desktop application right now.  Thank you!!!!!",
Best app to maintain to do list. Even free version offers a lot. Great tool to get organised.  Keep it up.,
"I've used a lot of GTD-influenced task managers, this one is pretty awesome.	Syncing works flawlessly and the ""quick add from anywhere"" feature makes the activation energy associated with adding a task as low as it should be.",
Simple to use and embedded where I need it on my devices. Ideal for collecting my tasks and providing prompts as required.,
Easy to use and well designed. Happy to have found this and recommend it to anyone that want's to get things done!,
"Functionally good App, however their non-stop emails has been a pain, they will just flood your inbox.",
"The best! Drag sorting on mobile just like web , Project folders, API... you can work how YOU want; not by someone elses workflow.",
Lots of features and works great.,
"Complicated recurrence entry, no assigning of task",
"Clean, nested projects and tasks. The Chrome extension is a killer feature.",
"Very helpful, helps me organize and keep track of tasks, even bills",
Very nice and neat! Would be better if project view is sortable by due date as well,
"Easy to use, no problems, and syncs with all my platforms. Can't ask for more.",
Would love it even more if it was integrated with Evernote.,
Able to see current progress on tasks with just a few taps.,
A very well thought out app / system. Cross platform goodness ;),
I love it,
good tool. i got the premium version.,
Integrates well across all my devices.,
Need to allow Sub Tasks,
Keeps my tasks at my fingertips 24/7,
A great task management tool.,
Best app on my Note 2,
Simple to use and gets the job done.,
Love it. Very easy to use!,
Simple and sinc. works great.,
A must have app,
great to use...,
"Perfect,  great UI.",
I love it!,
Awesome app!!!,
Works great,
Just what I needed,
Simple and extremely productive,
Very good app,
V good,
Simple and easy,
релама лезет,
"I have a lot of different things that I'm juggling at the same time - two side businesses, a management position, and a leader of a non profit. So getting things done is a must. That's when I bought into this awesome program! The cross platform is perfect for all of my devises. The labels, projects and notes make this app far superior than anything else out there on the market. It's a must have for anyone who wants to see their productivity go up,",
"Updated review: I love Todoist and use it across several platforms, but now what impresses me is their customer service.  My widget was crashing and they were prompt and thorough in helping fix it.",
"Really useful,  keeps me organized. I wish there was a way to share my task list with my spouse though, without using Wedoist, which isn't really what I want.",
Simple to do list app with tons of options if you want to set priorities or categories. I wish Google would buy this company so this could be integrated into Gmail. Nice work,
"Great usability, pity the free version doesn't offer sharing an google calendar syncing...",
Amazing user interface. Smooth as butter! Really my new favorite even over any do.,
"So easy to use and it can be added to outlook!  Love it, love it, love it!",
"A to do app, with upgrade prompts all over, but no working sync despite 4 updates in 5 days.   Best bit: after I updated to v 1.2.6 on both tablet and phone, and was frustrated to see it still not syncing, the app showed me a prompt to give feedback! LoL! Here you have.",
I wish the free version had more of the premium features. The subscription fee seems high.,
Works well for me,
Great,
The app is simple but have all the features I need !,
Most android faithful interface I have found in a to do app.,
"Everything I want in a to-do list, syncs across devices, template tasks, nested tasks and projects, notes with links, perfect",
"Great app.  Works across multiple platforms, and has reminders",
A great app for keeping track of multiple projects and tasks. Neat and efficient. Even helps inspire you to complete tasks with features to track your progress.,
"Basic features such as reminders are not free. Looks clean but too expensive. I'm not using 9 platforms to manage a simple to do list; therefore, your justification for a $4 monthly fee is invalid. Maybe a non-crippled trial version would be a better approach.",
"All you whiners complaining about the fees go find another app. I have tried a dozen and none can touch this one except Astrid and now Yahoo is going to shut them down. You get what you pay for and this is a well thought out, well crafted app with the best support of any app I've seen. This app crushes Any.Do on android. I don't mind paying for quality. The crying over fees on here is pathetic. I find it refreshing to see people making a living by producing something worth using.",
"This service has gotten me through college. Simple, yet flexible. My only request would be a prettier Web and app gui as well as an easier system for managing @labels. Other than that everything couldn't be better in my opinion",
"This is one of the better apps for syncing across devices. However, if you buy it be prepared to spend lots of time figuring out how to use it. It is not intuitive and there are many annoying issues...Way to many to go into here.. The web site has help videos but the content is superficial...i.e. stuff you can figure out for yourself. For the nitty gritty you're on your own. Also, in order to take advantage of all the features you have to fork over an additional $29.00 per year. Yikes.",
"The one killer feature for me is the Outlook plugin. This makes the app. Combine that with excellent syncing and a ""Karma"" system to keep you checking off the boxes, in my opinion this is the best to do app out there today.  Loses one star because it is hard to find information about security of the information stored in the Amazon cloud.",
"One of a number of list apps that I've tried-quite good. 1 issue: ""quick add"" does nothing in notifications. Gonna disable it.",
Charging for push notifications on a to do list app is ridiculous,
Easiest to use and natural flow todo app. Just needs function to collaborately work on tasks and you will get a 6 star from me. I am probably switching to astrid todo app because it offers collaboration and willing to sacrifice the ease of use on todoist :-( let me know when you add it and ill be back!!!,
It would be helpful if the program could distinguish between items that have been deleted and items completed.,
"Using it for a week, very nice tool. Probably this week I will migrate to premium. The project hierarchy is great.",
"Great App and great product, keeps me nice and organised!",
Love how it syncs across devices and links to email.,
I enjoy the labels functionality that comes with the premium,
Finally found a to-do app I like!,
Good overall app for day to day tasks.,
Very nice app!,
Love it!,
Very good tool overall,
Very useful,
Superb,
"Great app, the one I'll stick with after the Astrid/Yahoo fiasco. In my view though it loses a star for not offering reminders in the free version as Astrid did/does and another star for being way too expensive were I to choose to upgrade to premium. The only extra I need is reminders and I'm not paying through the nose for that while I can find a way around it.",
"It's a pretty solid and good looking app. Support is quick at supplying at least an answer. Still waiting for collapsible subtasks and subprojects. Would really love sequential tasks though.  Edit: uprated to 5 stars since collapsible tasks and projects were implemented. Sequential tasks would be awesome, but seeing how they don't implement next actions, I didn't rate the app on it",
"If you do a search on Google play for (Todo list, ToDo's, Task, Task List, Etc.) all applications that are returned I have tried and most I have purchased. I am a Todo / Task freak and at the end of the day after trying all on the market I kept coming back to only 2 (Todoist and Any.Do) In the last week or so I was committed to choosing only one to stick with  and I just deleted Any.Do (GREAT app but someone has to come in second). I could go on and on about what makes Todoist better than all the rest but my suggestion is to do what I did, download it a see for yourself. Now comes the only negative part I can come up with, I am very aware and in most cases agree on developers compensation for their time and talents, however having said that, the ""premium"" version at $29.00/yr. is steep in today’s age of dirt cheap hosting / and all the technology that goes along with what is offered in the premium it should be MUCH less or free, but I am overjoyed with the way Todoist is right now and hope it only gets better. Many thanks to the developers for the great app and hope no offense was taken on the ONLY thing I could say about it.",
"I thought I'd try this out, but BASIC features like having a note against a task are only available to ""premium"" users. I can understand limiting some of the more unique features, but at this point it is so badly hobbled I can't even give it a trial run to decide if I want to give them money at all, so onto the uninstalled pile it goes, and back to Any.DO I go! -------------- More notes to the devs: (1) I will not pay monthly for this, or any app. Make a one-time-fee version that doesn't have cloud storage, which I don't even need, since you keep quoting that as the reason for the need for an ongoing charge (2) Those who might actually be willing to pay will be turned off by not having access to a proper trial run. Other apps have won me over by allowing a week or so of usage as if I had paid, so that I actually know what I'm going to get. This might be a good model to try out after glancing at the other low reviews.",
"This is the only task app that I have kept using.  The integration with outlook, chrome, and android makes it so useful.",
Pulled the trigger and it was worth it.,
Best to do tasking app for me since transferring from Astrid.,
I rarely get a notification around the time a task is due. I do get the summation notification though.,
"The strongest feature of Todoist is the apps reoccurring task feature. The ability to set a repeating task with different days of the week and times of the year is unparalleled. (However, I would like to see the addition of quarterly date ranges and the ability to set a tasks final deadline and a reoccurring one for constant reminding, among other options.)  The quality of the apps experience makes me a convert to the subscription-based payment model. Now they need to make a calendar app.",
"I think you've done an incredible job at this task management solution.  I would only suggest that for the due-date section on mobile devices be a full calendar pop-up rather than the M/D/Y scroll wheels.  Aside from that, I would gladly pay for the premium version but I simply can't justify a recurring charge for it.  I believe in supporting excellent developers, but the recurring charge in my mind is a little too much.    This app was suggested to me by a friend who, I quote:  ""I wonder how the devs would feel if they knew I put a 'todoist' task that said 'Find Toidist premium .apk'. Recurring charges for apps is a little too much""",
"With the vast selection of calendars available and other free apps like Taskos who update frequently as well.   I can't justify paying for this especially not as a reoccuring payment deal. Ads could support the functionally of the ""free"" version.  To be honest with almost no functional services like push notifications in the free version I can't justify wasting my time to even test it thoroughly.",
"The Android app has finally reached the same high standard as the web version.  The only nuisance is the Google calendar sync delay of up to 24h - a limitation in the way Todoist implements sync, which some apps (Springpad, GQueues, for example) manage to avoid.",
"Two main things. Support is totally outstanding. Quick response to questions. Second, I have tried so many apps to manage m projects and this is the only one that covered all my need and then some.  Well worth the money.  Recommend to anyone who manages multiple projects.",
"I love the app - in fact this is the second time I've subscribed. I came back to this app after trying all the other ones, and loved this one too much. Here's what its missing though: recurring tasks, a ""quick-add"" feature like rtm's that parses plain English and allows #tagging. Also, the notes function could be improved- if I don't have any notes yet, I should have to press the plus button, I should be able to start typing. Also, the notes box should be multi line. Maybe with markdown styling/ WYSIWYG",
"The TD app does everything I need it to do, without a lot of excess nonsense. Highly recommended.",
"Has helped with productivity tremendously.  Haven't taken the plunge on the pay version, but will likely be necessary.  Cross-platform utility is wonderful.",
"Really useful. I like how you can prioritize and the different ways you can display and sort lists.	I wish I could figure out how to get the things I've checked off to disappear from my phone. They don't show up on my computer.",
"Although I don't use the app much, it's great. Useful to be able to sync my phone and laptop, and that I don't need internet to use the app. Useful if I have a to-do list when I'm on the go, or as a shopping list :)",
"When I'm busy, tasks fall out of my brain and todoist is there to catch them",
I love the cross-compatibility with just about everything. It's convenient and it does everything I need it to. The latest updates and fixes have nullified my issues. Thanks guys!,
I've tried many to do apps and have been looking for an app that makes it fun and pretty to key in tasks. Todoist fits the criteria.,
App sucks. Tried logging in using google account and it just brings me back to the choose which account to use. Back button doesn't even work to get out of that screen. Please fix this.,
"Finally a task management solution that does all I need it to do. Online management portal, and simple yet powerful interface. It does what technology should do! Simplify. I use this to manage my personal and office related tasks. Also WeDoist has been very helpful at the office. This development team knows its stuff.",
"I've tried several, lots that I like about this...almost ready to pull the trigger on buying the full version!",
"No matter if you use it on the web, on a phone or tablet it works. Some of the features are not the most intuitive but if you spend a little time learning the conventions then it will fly.",
You can easily share your projects and tasks between your laptop phone and desktop. For me the projects and tasks are displayed the way I think.  Free for now. When they start charging I will gladly pay a reasonable once-a-year fee.,
I love this todo app list. Definitely wanna Pay for this if There's additional plan with lower yearly payment option including basic feature like auto syncing and gtask integration.,
Love the fact that task can be organized in small projects. The sync with calendars and productivity reports are also a big plus!!!,
"I really get a lot more done. I love that I can sync with crome, my phone, and outlook.",
"Great project for easily managing and organizing tasks. Cross platform support is seamless. I use daily (hourly) on my MacBook, Windows desktop, and via the Android app on my Samsung G 3.",
This app is easy to use and a good compliment to the website.,
"Would really like pop up screen alerts, otherwise brilliant.",
"As a sales , this app totally rocks ! Keep up with the good work guys !",
"Was having Astrid withdrawal, now I'm feeling better",
I really like how this integrates with other platforms. Very nice.,
Awesome to keep up on all those pesky tasks.,
Love this app! Been looking for something like this for a while. Good work!,
Fills my notification bar with reminders to use the app more. Annoying and rude. Imagine if all you apps did that? Uninstalled.,
"It's a decent piece but I have long lists sometimes, and having to scroll down and search for incomplete tasks is a pain. The Web client does it well but why not here when screen size is even smaller? I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. The problem remains. And yes I am talking about sub-tasks whose parent task would still be unchecked until all the subtasks are complete.",
Very easy to manage tasks and I like that you can access them online and on your desktop,
"Simple and clear, intuitive interface. Missing time tracking feature, hope to see it soon!",
simple yet complex enough to suit all your needs with a clean cut non distracting feel,
My favourite to do app. And I've tried a lot!,
Excellent app. Love the ability to quickly add a task.,
Perisian yang akan cadangkan pada rakan-rakan.,
Has all features I needed. Hasn't annoyed me yet.,
Great app wish it was 1 time fee,
Best Android to do list.,
"Simply  fantastic app,  very useful very productive",
so easy to use,
Keeps me organized,
The best to-do app,
So good!,
Simple & works!,
Awesome!,
Pretty good productivity app,
Great way to get organized,
Great app for managing time,
Great app.,
Useful productivity app,
One of the best app,
Great,
Excellent tool,
Great app,
Great,
good,
Great,
Excellent,
Goog app.,
^_^,
"Simple to use and works well. Able to categorise tasks by assigning them to projects. Only drawback is that you can only view future tasks or older tasks at once, not all tasks in one list unless you upgrade to premium.",
Love it!,
It really works. Great app that's getting me more productive!,
Like the feedback or gives on task completion - or lack thereof,
Easy to use,
"When I mark a task completed, a strike through is added to the text, but the task doesn't go away. To me this is a deal breaker. I get a visceral satisfaction to winnowing down my to do list which isn't there with this app. On the web interface I can at least refresh the screen and completed tasks will disappear. I haven't found a solution with the app.",
"Installed this app for few weeks, and i think i like it.. Replace my previous used app with this one.. Got confused a little at first, but there is good at final.. I love the reminder by email.. I will trying this for my busy scheduling task, and maybe i will looking for the other features.. Keep it up..",
"Thanks, your solution make better.",
Helps keep me in check with reminders and also helps me plan out my days.,
Was waiting for this app on android. Loving it,
"Subscribed because the app seems to be going in the right direction lately. This really is the best todo app on Android. I was originally concerned with the pricing, but the developers have been chipping away at my wish list and the price seems to fit the product better. 5 stars when we get local reminders, and thanks for the lockscreen widget!",
I have used several todo apps and continue to delete them off my phone because they are all crap and don't offer the flexibility I need daily. I dowloaded Todoist on my phone and fell in love. They really understand simplistic design and the intigration with Chrome and Outlook is such a plus. Within an hour of use I had to by.,
"A colleague told me about this app, so I am trying it out. It's a little clumsy to use, and having to pay to get notifications for a to-do list is ridiculous. So far, I like my old standby Astrid better.",
"I don't have time to look into how things work. They just need to work first time and with no hiccups. Installed. Received message in alert bar to ""quickly and easily add a task"". Tried it. Wouldn't let me save task without adding to a project. Project list was empty and didn't have the means of adding project. Support page requires login. Too many hurdles. Oh well. Uninstalled.",
"I have used todoist online before the app came out with excellent results. When the app came out I instantly downloaded and took advantage of all the features including daily and weekly overviews, priority setting, ""human due dates"", sub categories and project labels. Todoist takes full advantage of all android features like home screen widgets where full tasks can be added, edited completed and updated. Lock screen widget is also use full. This is all from the FREEE version, I expect the pro version is 5*",
Paid for premium...not clear  how to sync with Outlook.  I can't easily sync to google either. Other apps do this better.  Notes are limited with no options.  Is this a work in progress? You can get one month from me but that would be it. Maybe it is better to get things working before charging.  Update....I can sync with google now but it puts my tasks in the calendar. This app is just too much of a pain compared to the others. I can't see posting $4 a month so it is time to move on. Thanks for responding.,
"Great application, i use it to track my shopping list among other lists. I especially like the lock screen access.",
"I was a long time user of Remember the Milk, but got tired of obvious missing functionality. Discovered ToDoist and now have almost everything I wanted.  Very happy.",
"Can't give 5 stars bcz most of features are for premium users.  There seems a bug. I've emailed it with screenshots. On scheduling a task on 15/April i.e. Monday, it shows 15/April as Sunday. Plz fix it then will give one more star.",
Works great.  I only use the free version but it solves many of my every day purposes.  Groceries/repairs/housework/etc.,
Thanks to its offline usage and sync across devices and and everything - I can now add tasks to my to do list no the fly. Greatly increases productivity.,
"With the recently added widgets, been fantastic. Probably one of the best if not the best to do managers available. I have been keeping much better track of my task and the new karma feature is novel.",
"Good but lacking the ""next 7 days AND OVERDUE""  vue,  it would be useful to be able to drag an overdue task on a day of my choosing. and the ""all project"" like the outlook plug in and the Web app.  If fixed 5star",
"Really slick app, but to really get the most from it I need the use of the home screen widget to constantly remind myself of my outstanding tasks. Unfortunately the widget has a bug where after a short amount of time it needs resetting before it shows tasks again. This is when using it in 'project' mode.",
"Best thing it feels very simple but it's surprisingly flexible, for example you can create as many hierarchical levels as you want which actually is not that common...",
"I love todoist. It's quick, easy, and simple but still offers plenty of features. I love organizing in outline/hierarchy.",
"I think this app does a great job of organisation of tasks, reporting efficiency. I think a glaring flaw is I can't give task alerts, put a time deadline. That is what I need, I need to be reminded. Good otherwise.",
Really helps me to organise things. Synced it with the one in computer and it is real comfortable.,
Too pricey for the whole hog and limited calender Sync but great to use otherwise.,
"Hard out loving this app. It syncs awesomely with google chrome todoist. You know how you want to find that great app that works and is free, but that it MIGHT turn out to be the one you'd pay for??!! This is it! Awesome.",
"- Very simple, elegant design - Easy to use with scheduling shortcuts!",
"Todoist is a great service, with the app you can add tasks straight from the notification window.",
Use it all the time. Combined with the firefox plugin its the best gtd app out there,
"One of my most used apps on my PC, iPad and Android phone.  Been using it on my PC for a year now.",
"Best todo so far, with an Android app that's getting better every day. Love these guys!",
"So easy to use,  sync and organise.  Definitely recommend.",
Couldn't live without this app. I love everything about it.,
Great program to keep track of those little task we forget.,
"Best app ever, super easy to use :) doesn't crash",
ToDoist is the best productivity app on the market. Hands-down.,
Excellent app - syncs tasks to the web and desktop clients,
Works well everywhere. PC tablet and phone.,
Its good and organize ur ideas,
Really enjoy using this.,
Best to-do solution available,
Love this app :-),
Useful and easy to use.,
Easy,
Ok for me,
"There  were some rough spots when I first started, but they were resolved, some taking longer than others.  But the most recent relases have worked well and have brought some great functionality across all of the platforms {Mac, Windows, Android}  There are still some things that could be added to make this a killer app.",
They concept isn't great; execution could be better. Interface and convenience are the two areas that I would like to see improvement in.  However still useful at the moment :),
"I really like the UI - clean, easy. That said, Postpone seems a bit flaky, I'd really like to be able to edit reminders like setting due date and I'd LOVE a quick add widget.",
"I have a gazillion things to do at work, home, and PTA & a to list is essential! I have a windows computer @ home, a mac @ work, & an android phone. I was using remember the milk which was good, but I was constantly searching for a mac desktop app. Todoist has everything and I'm ecstatic! The mac desktop app & android widget is sleek, scrollable, the widget is resizable, & entering new things to do is a breeze. I gladly paid for the premium!",
I love the app. It's functional and well-integrated into Android. My only annoyance is that the widget is massive and unresizable. It'd be awesome to have that fixed.,
"I have used the Todoist web site for five years, but it was the release of the apps for the iPhone and Android that made my actually subscribe to the service. The apps work a dream. I love writing up my shopping list on my desktop PC and then getting my phone out in the supermarket to pick up all my groceries.",
"I've used every todo product that I've been able to get my hands on. Some were too basic, some too complex. Some had too much ""feature bloat"", some hardly had any features at all. Todoist has found the perfect balance between function and form and that makes it a winner in my opinion. 5 stars!",
"I'm really impressed with how far this app has come. It's incredibly sleek and polished, with tons of features. Highly recommend.",
Favourite task list app! Use it all the time...Wedoist is rocking too! PS Synchronicity between the two would be great! ;),
Looking forward to more functionality.,
Monthly fee for a to do list? Ha! No thanks.,
Perfect fit for my needs,
"I've used a lot (and I mean a lot) of task apps. This is one of the very very few that I really like and the first one I've paid for since RTM. The syncing between platforms is huge. Labels, sub tasks, and ease of use is all there. I love it.",
"Awesome app! Helps me keep track of my daily activities. If you have trouble remembering everything you have to do, this is the right app for you!",
BEST TO DO LIST EVER,
Love this app... Keeps me organized by day and by project. Perfect!,
"Tablet is useable now, and there is a widget, although I am not able to add it because it requires more than 2 rows of icons apparently (my calendar widget fits in 2 rows, so this should too). I am having issues with syncing.Some tasks show up as completed in some places and not in others. Weird. Well, keep up the work, I am confident TD is the best bet.",
And gets the job done. I was using remember the milk before but found it fiddly,
"Great UI, clean integration across browsers and mobile. You only need one to do list app and it is todoist.",
Very nice. Fully-featured settings for complete organizing of your tasks. Works well on my HTC rhyme cell and Samsung galexy 2 tablet.,
I don't feel like much more work would be necessary for a tablet version. Just don't hide the menu. That would be awesome.  EDIT: You did it and it is awesome!,
"Loved the simplicity of the interface and the fact that it is available in the browser, on the phone, even within email. Highly recommended to people who want a simple to do list tracking and reminding application. Scales nicely as you add tasks, subtasks, file them under different projects and labels.",
"BEST to do manager, I use it every day. I especially like being able to create tree hierarchy of projects and task-other good tools offer only flat list with tags or keywords.",
"Overall a great app. My main request is for a widget to go with it, similar to gtasks widget. It should list a project, label or a predefined query.   EDIT: Thanks for adding widgets!  5 stars! Love the new features. Another suggestion that would make this app even better - a way to add new or edit existing reminders, similar to web version.",
"... Data backup has been disallowed  (EDIT: I mean the ability for other apps, such as Carbon Backup, to make a backup of my data) (increased to 5 stars - amazing support and great to know issue is being addressed)",
Finally a task manager that really does what I need,
"Terrific UI, good power-to-weight ratio.",
Awesome!,
Absolutely perfect!  Had posted a 4 Star review asking for a widget -- now there are two great widgets!  My productivity and notetaking abilities on my phone have skyrocketed!  Synced with Todoist on my PC and Mac -- astouding!  So simple and easy to use.  It blows away anything else!,
Not often I give one star. But when I do. I make sure it's because of once per day sync limitation,
"Very good, but the widget crashes on my Motorola Milestone 2 running Android 2.2.",
With a widget now available this is by far the most intuitive To Do app on the market.,
Android users would love to have a widget with a list on their screen.  Please consider this,
Lock screen widget works now! How about dash clock integration too?,
"I needed something that plays nice with PC and allows sub tasks and projects.   Astrid does the former but not the latter. And since Due Today's Windows version became entirely unreliable to me, it only does the latter.   Todoist is perfect. It's also beautiful and way easy to use. Well worth the modest price for a premium account.",
"I have multiple projects on the go all the time. I can give them separate to do lists, prioritise jobs and easily send reminders to my Android phone without emailing. I can have a sidebar on Thunderbird and Firefox open when I want to keep myself remonded. Only problem is I've no excuse for forgetting things! Great app.",
For 'premium' features which are free in most other Task List apps you're stung for $4 a month! Even as a basic user you don't get a reminder function for your tasks. Shame as the UI looks pretty slick.,
"It's ok, the app works, but what you want from the todo app is to be intuitive and quick to use. There are still some things that makes me swear while wrestling with the interface. For example, why it's difficult to find the way to delete a project, or why the device back button closes the app instead of bringing me back where I've been within the app? I think there's lot of space to improve the overall usability.",
"GOOGLE tasks too simple, Remember The Milk has usability/interface issues. I keep finding more reasons why this is so good. Perfect balance of simplicity with powerful features that don't get in your way. Only feature I would like is a shared list (ok if only with other paying users). Great front end on Web and android.",
"I am a college student and always trying to find the best ways to organize myself for maximal efficiency.  The features of Todoist are extensive and flexible enough to accommodate any commitment, project, or class.  The indenting ability is key for tabbing out projects and remembering those little things you have to do.  Finally, the overview and search capabilities are perfect.  With tags you can remember all the things you need to do between 9 and 5 and crank them all out.",
"The app might be okay but the limited sync capability made me uninstall instantly. I might part $2 or maybe $2.50 once. Otherwise, I'm not interested when there are plenty of free alternatives.  Thanks to the dev for the response! I've reinstalled and updated my rating!! I'd give 5 stars but tend to experience crashes on my android. Web interface is great, though and the app is easy to use.",
"I really like the app.  The only issue I have is with the way in which completed tasks are not synced across all devices.  When I mark a task complete on my phone, I  still get an alert on my tablet.  Then I have to mark it complete again.  This is a bit annoying, but not a deal-breaker.",
"Seriously, you want a monthly subscription... That's just greedy.  Who does that?  This needs a non cloud based option for free.  In response to the reply: I'm a developer and know that it doesn't take massive hardware and clustered servers to run something as small as this.  Honestly, a godaddy hosting plan would probably be enough.  No need for expensive data centers.  I'd love to see a detailed description of the code base and ""cloud"" layout.",
If like me you have a lot of tasks that repeat regularly then this is a great app for you. It allows me to maintain daily to do lists that help me keep up with all the regular chores in my life. I couldn't function without this now!,
"Clean, simple UI. Topnotch customer service. Expect me to use this for a long time if it adds more useful features.",
"Most of the others are toys, so far, but I've been using this for 2-3 years, before I got my Android tablet. I upgraded to the previous version, so I'd have more options. It gets better and better. I can now drag tasks from one project to another, color-code them according to priority, or type of task (something that I must do outside or several phases of the same task, for example). It's quite flexible and intuitive. It helps me avoid forgetting things, keeps me from feeling so overwhelmed by constantly thinking of things I need to or forgot to do (and because I can break things into small, manageable tasks), and I love clicking things off my to-do list. It also saves me time, because I enter labels by store or town, and then I can quickly sort them to group tasks together. It will send updates to email, but I access it on my office computer and my tablet, and it's great that I can do that both places and it's always in sync. No, nobody is paying me to write this rave review! I tried several similar apps, and this one's the best for me. And it even makes weekly productivity graphs for you! Perfect.",
This asp would be perfect if the reminders were more reliable and it had widgets. A to-do list without widgets is not very handy. But I absolutely love the design.,
This app is smooth and well put together. The design that went into it blows the other Todoist apps out of the water. Definitely worth upgrading to premium if you're a heavy task list user.,
"Been using todoist for a while on the PC and seeing I could use it on my nexus 7 and galaxy note I haven't stopped admiring it! Looking forward to more features soon, like lock screen widgets, any widgets to be honest!",
"I've used many to do apps,  but this one beats them all.   Their support is awesome as well-very responsive",
I like that i can have this on my computers and phone so that it all syncs together. What i would like to see though is maybe notifications that can come up in the status bar.,
I've tried many task list apps and this is the only one that has all the features I want while keeping a simple and clean interface.  I highly recommend trying it.,
Integrates effortlessly with the online version and provides good organizational treasures without becoming complicated.,
"To do lists are tough b/c everyone looks for something that works for them. This app is perfect for anyone looking for a fast, easy way to keep track of everything you have to do. Simple and effective and I love the UI. Everyone has their favorites but this one's at the top of the to do list category for me and I've tried them all.",
"A little bit difficult to get used to, but it is a small downside of GREAT custumization opportunities and LOTS of functions.  I have tried dozens of task-apps, this one is the most advanced.",
This app changed how I track everything for my clients... Setting dates is a little difficult and kind of strange... But over all I love it!,
"After reviewing pretty much every other todo products out there, I've settled on Todoist. It's not perfect, but it's the best of its kind.",
"So pleased Todoist have made a decent native Android app. It is a great start, and I look forward to seeing it develop. While the basics are there it would benefit from some enhancements to managing projects and moving tasks around. A widget would be great. Well done :-)",
"I was searching for a To Do list app for a very long time now, and Todoist serves the purpose completely. The best is the sync feature, I can add some task on my mobile and it automatically sync to my laptop.",
"I've tried several to do list apps and Todoist is my favorite, hands down. I love how it syncs seamlessly with the Web app, the user interface and the ease of use.",
"Excellent. Remove all other task lists and pledge allegiance to Todoist!	Excellent app. Been waiting for this app with these features for a long time.",
There are lots of task list programs out there but Todoist is the best I've used.  I sincerely recommend it.,
After changing the syncing policy (from 1 per day to unlimited) now this application is a perfect add-on to chrome browser plugin that I'm already using. Additionally the UI looks great.  Thanks for releasing this helpful application!,
"Significant bugs make it almost unusable, despite the service being good via web",
"The sync can be a bit buggy, but awesome overall!",
"I got the same issue 2 times: - No wifi - Add items to list on phone - Todoist shows endless spinner - Find a wifi, spinner still works, but i don't see new items on laptop - Ok, add items on laptop again :( - Find a broken list later (i think todoist was restarted and synced)",
I just recently started using Todoist. What a great program! It's helped keep me so organized!,
"I have a very active and busy life with many tasks and duties It keeps my life in order,",
"This one does it all. Good organization, links to Google calendar. Wish there was a setting to say when I want the daily email. Otherwise 5 stars!",
Almost every other feature is premium.,
Best task system I've used and I've tried a lot! Soon as widgets are added ToDoist will get 5 stars from me ;-),
Would be 5 star if it didn't limit the free version so much.,
"I am really enjoying Todoist.  As a busy mom I am just trying to keep up & organized, this app helps a lot!!  Would love to see the sub tasks of a master task in the app like the web, if just the master list has a due date.",
"Cell, laptop, desktop... Simplest way I have found yet to sync my busy schedule. Very happy to say Todoist is my daily task and business planner.",
Wish I would've found this app sooner!,
You will never change your life before you change your how you use your time.,
"The app looks great, and I love that it syncs automatically, keep it up!",
Best task list!  Easy to use. Tried a couple of other apps and this is the best!,
It is unfortunately better than I am.,
The devs try hard to fix everything fast,
Very good app. It syncs with Firefox. This app just increased my productivity.,
Nexus 4 - works great on my desktop and on my phone.,
"This app and it's associated website, chrome plugin, Mac app, etc. make it a great way to stay up to date on what needs doing.",
Have this on my phone and desktop. It syncs seamlessly and keeps it simple.,
Would like to see an option to view all tasks.,
I love this app and its companion on my pc.  It works perfectly on my Galaxy S3! ! !,
Seems to work well with web and desktop apps.,
"A wonderful all in one planner for the single person, and a big company!",
"I love a to do app, and this is the best I have used.",
I love the ease of use and the different devices able to connect to this program,
Really good app for task management specially when u r dealing with multiple projects,
"Easy to use, the right balance!",
work great. keep adding feature.,
"Nice flow, smooth graphics!",
Well designed and good looking app using for past 3 months without any issues,
"Very helpful, definitely worth buying.",
So good I use it every day,
Excellent interface works as advertised.,
Use it every day,
Really beautiful and easy to use. Definitely recommended.,
!,
Nice minimal todo list for free,
One of the best to do apps,
Best scheduling and task app.,
Great service now has app to match.,
I use it to organize my life.,
Just the right balance of features and simplicity.,
Works pretty well.,
"Simple, sync, multi-platform, great tool, just right.",
Best app in category.,
Would be a five state if you can figure out how to get it to do the tasks for me,
The best to do app...period!,
"Simple, flexible, and powerful.",
The best out there!,
And free!!,
Good software.,
Excellent.,
Really useful,
Im loving it,
Great app,
Simple and great,
May we please have an android widget?,
Great,
Great,
good,
"At first I really liked using todoist,  but there are some things I really don't like about it. One, that you have to pay for certain features which are just standard in any to do-list app like searching for a task or setting a reminder. And paying isn't a one time thing either which would be maybe worth the investment,  its a subscription. Second, i don't like the fact that you have to assign a category to every task, especially when the long list of categories isn't collapsible in the app,  only online.",
"... hampered by the fact that too much of the functional tweaks are paid ones, COMPARED to dozens other to-do app I've tried and used. =( Seriously, the UI/UX is informative, the paid one is very multifunctional yet still as simple as possible, and the categorization/tagging feature is a hoot. I WOULD SOOO USE IT if not for that fact.",
"I use To do it for both personal and work items, and find it invaluable for keeping on top of things. The fact that I can use the in-browser app, android app and calendar integration means I don't have an excuse to postpone my tasks until tomorrow.",
"Fairly basic in comparison to the web or browser add-on.  Would like to be able to start in a given project, as opposed to just 'Today' by default.  Would also like to be able to add a task in a particular spot (as opposed to the end and re-dragging).  Would also like the ability to collapse sections (ones with sub-indented entries), as in the browser add-on.",
"I LOVED todoist when I had it on my iPod touch and I was so exited to see that there was an Android app for it at last, but this is certainly not what I was waiting for. Too many functions are missing--not because they aren't made but because we have to pay for them? And the price is too high. I really hope the developers change the app to be more usable, because I really do like todoist a lot....",
Great little app. Has readily helped me get a handle on the plethora of tasks I seem to accumulate each day.,
Great app!   Projects and subtasks are key differentiators.  Well done with a clean intuitive interface.    Finish the sharing options for five stars.,
Been using the web app for some time now. Was excited when the phone app came out. Great app for the price.,
"instead, it prompts for login, signup. lying gets one star and uninstall.",
Just got better with the DT app for win & mac. The best for tasks linked to web pages.,
"If you good people want a fast, elegantly simple todo app try ""Tasks"" in the Play Store made by Codename Blueberry. Honestly, I've tried to like Todoist, but it's too slow and bloated.",
Helps in my business and personal stuff. An essential organizing tool. Impressed by the app so well done.,
Great way to stay on task managing several projects for multiple clients.,
Finally have an app that makes task management easy to manage!,
Great productivity tool. It makes everything much easier.,
Greatest To Do List Ever Made,
Great app thanks and easy to use,
Nice UI and responsiveness after WL2,
Simple yet powerful tasking app.,
Excellent,
Show!,
Very limited,
Needs widget! So for now im sticking with googles todo list app.,
do not install on your computer!  slows everything! and installs programs in conjunction w outlook you don't know if removing it will affect your outlook program!!,
"I love the new native Todoist app and have been waiting a long time for it. Definitely worth the money. But I do have 3 small feature requests. I would love to be able to change the notification sound. I would also like to have the option to set the reminders to push at the time that a task is due, instead of 30 minutes prior. Finally, I would love to have the option to select multiple tasks for an action. Keep up the good work!",
"As a long time Todoist user, I'm really impressed with the Android app.  Extremely fast and intuitive and works hand in hand with the online version.  It's a beautiful app...there are a few small things that could be improved buy the team has put out updates daily since release and continues to listen to it's users.  Can't ask for anything more!",
Disappointed with this app.  I liked the online site & awaited anxiously this Android app.  No reminders system & didn't like the pricing scheme so I will continue to use Any.Do ad-driven free app.  Might try this again if they offer ad-driven free app with reminders as an option.,
"I have used todoist and wedoist for years.  This app is a great complement and works well. Wish they had one for wedoist, but can't complain.",
"The lengthy comments are just because i love your product. Now read on.  Are you Serious Ist Prod Devs? In these modern days you still expect us to pay 29$/Year or 3$ a month For a task app. Huhn?!?  To be honest, Now this is something which prompts somebody to crack your app/ use similar application (or) even worse is STEAL YOUR IDEA and develop it into a new product. Wake up while you can or you might be in the corner of doom.  Come on man, REDUCE the prices and we're all good. Alright?",
I love Todoist's website for its impeccable combination of simplicity and power. This app lives up to the legacy. Great work.,
"The app contains most of the functionality available on the full website. Extremely useful, finally having an app that mirrors why I chose Todoist in the first place.",
I've tried several task management apps.  This is one of the best. I really wish it was completely free; but people have to make a living too.,
I started using this app a week ago and already it's part of my life. The best app I have found for managing tasks and honey-do lists!,
Been impressed so far with the offline/online coordination. Big todoist fan.,
"I have been using the app since official release day, and so far I've been well-impressed.   The Todoist team seems to have taken their time with this, and thought carefully through the UI and design. This has helped reinforce routine use of Todoist for me, and I look forward to any enhancements the team has in store in the future.   Keep up the great work!",
This app intergrates nicely with my GMail calender and Chrome browser. Its very simple and easy to use. I can now see all my tasks to do and focus on getting tasks completed.,
"I used to be upset, but the developer contacted me in person to assist me with my issues and show me that the pro versioon of this software really is worth the 30/yr pricetag.",
"I'm really getting into this one. Some things I would like  Swipe to show task is done Call, email from app.",
Great app for school as you can split classes separately and copy and paste straight onto the chrome app from the syllabus. No more mani entry!,
"This app is nice and perfect to manage my todolist, both for work and personal.",
Can we get a tablet friendly version of this app? Good free app but not totally useful unless you pay for a ToDoist subscription,
"Just what I was looking for, great todo app, with awesome cross platform integration.",
This has everything I'm looking for in productivity apps. I'm happy to have found it.,
After the initial hickup i use it every day! It makes life a lot easier!,
"Really good features, but sync with google calendar would be a major improvement.",
Cool thing. Just needs Google tasks integration.,
Please enable sorting tasks by due date then this app is definitely a 5.,
Its a clean design and a fast app. Just needs a desktop widget and push notifications.,
Great integrated product. Use on phone and computers at hinge and office.,
Still could use some updating items bit it is a goos application,
"Price too high. No widget, no trial period to test features.   Outlook plug in is garbage.",
App works great! No complaints.,
"Great app, very useful",
Please allow syncing with calendar,
Very intuitive and useful.,
Super useful ToDo solution.,
"Love it , veryhelpful",
Love it!,
Such a good app!,
This super task list organizer has stepped up a notch now that it is available via am native Android app!,
Best one for todo list,
Looking good.,
Great so far,
Very good,
Meet my need,
"This is rather good start, with nice and mostly usable interface. But some things need improving. The start of the application is painfully slow. There's no way to set reminders from the app. Deleting a task requires 4 clicks. No way to collapse elements in the project tree. The design of the task list is not inspiring. Say, Any.Do is much nicer in this respect. Or in fact, just optionally hiding the project label.",
"Changing my rating since they changed the uneblievably stupid limitation of 1 sync/day (what were they thinking anyway?). Now it's a nice enough program, with lots of options and possibilities, but somewhat awkward for simple use.  The app itself is not bad, offers some nice features and shortcuts, but it lacks clarity and simplicity. Does need some reworking - maybe it's superb to handle large 'projects', but for simpler stuff  (I bet everyone's first 'project' is a shopping list) it's somewhat awkward.",
"I have the two-factor login enabled and this app just tells me that my email & password are not correct. I've verified that everything is right, but it refuses to use my existing Google account to login. I tried the website for support, but it appears I would need to register there separately as well in order to even ask a question or confirm my current guess about lack of two-factor support. I'm not interested in creating and tracking another account. So much for increased productivity, as far as I can tell from the outside this app and company haven't thought out their solution beyond an initial glossy front-end.",
Works well and looks spectacular. The sync service and labeling premium features are too expensive for my type of usage. It might be worth it for power users though.,
"Sure, in its first release there might have been some features missing, but the devs are making up for it, with regular updates that actually address the small issues some users have. Carry on the good work!",
"My favourite to do app, it's just so good! Wish there was an option to pay a one-time fee to unlock premium features (ex. syncing)",
Google auth does not work,
"Manual sync should not be a premium feature while ALL task apps provide this feature for free if charge. I would be happy to pay a 3.99 one time fee, but $3.99 a month is a bit ridiculous.",
Doesn't work with Google account when your account has two step authentication.,
no widget nor native notifications. Way much better than other todoist apps,
"Very nice to see an Android app, and a nicely executed one at that. Great work guys, please add a widget.",
high premium price. And I want to share my lists.,
"Needs a widget but other than that, it's good.",
NO WIDGET???,
"This Web application has improved my work and personal life. Any time I have an idea or task I simply punch it in. The categories are a great way to organize and everything is beautiful and intuitive. This new app makes it even better. Go for the premium experience and use it, it's absolutely worth the price.",
"I have been using todoist for years, it is the only thing able to keep me organized, and I have wanted a usable app for so long. App looks great, and performs well.  I am a little disappointed over no automatic refresh except for pay users, but not a game over. Still a great value for what I'm paying ($0).",
"I love Todoist. It's the only thing that's managed to keep my office and home tasks in check.  Unfortunately, this app doesn't really do much to compliment it without a premium subscription. Cannot sync more than once per day, interface is clunky... I much prefer to use the mobile website which is clean, intuitive, and best of all, refreshes for free.  Will be interested to see how long this model lasts.",
"Well, yes I would prefer an ad supported version, but this was the only thing I was missing for your todoist to be perfect. Bravo and I will upgrade to premium just because this completes the circle.  But I can see other peoples' point of view, this will annoy a lot of people.  You should either: 1) make the app paid 1 time with unlimited sync 2) make the app free ad supported (with 1h sync it might be acceptable) 3) both options <- i would vote for this  Free but with a very, very serious limitation is not the way forward I think.",
"Look, I understand you need to try to make a profit, but like others have said, why not just provide a flat one time fee for the droid app vs having to fully upgrade to a premium membership? I'd be willing to pay $5 for a highly polished app that syncs with todoist, but this isn't even a good app (see below) and I really don't need al the features of the full membership.  For now, I'll just go back to using one of the free apps that syncs with todoist.    In reagard to the features: 1) Where is the way to quickly mark a task completed? It actually takes two clicks? that's just dumb. The other free apps supporting the todoist api have a simple checkbox.  Why not have the checkbox and the advanced options you have when you click a task? I'm guessing 99% of the people that use a todo app are using it keep a quick list of things todo (like a grocery list) and want a quick way to check them off that they're completed. 2) the tasks take up wayyyyy too much vertical space (at least on my galaxy s2)  I want to see more of my tasks without having to scroll.  Note: I love the ToDoist chrome plugin",
"As a long time Todoist user (and a relatively new smartphone user), this new version is great. There is however one feature not present on the smartphone app. My preference (on a computer) shows Overdue, today and tomorrow. This is not available on the smartphone version and I encourage the makers to add it to make it a perfect reminder program.",
Two clicks to mark task completed. Can't configure the startup view and/or project. Only one sync per 24 hours in free version.  Waited a long time for official app. Was going to upgrade to premium once released. Not anymore. Third party options seem better for me.,
"Works and looks great on phone. Been trying to use free apps (Budoist, Tisktasks), but nothing comes close to this! Very well polished!  Two suggestions for future updates: Create widget with ability to tick off straight from widget, Show 'notes icon' if notes attached to item on list.  If those two things get added in future updates, it'll be sweet!",
"Nice to see a polished native app, but limiting sync to once per day makes this a toy demo, not something to actually use to complement the web version. EDIT: they listen, kudos!",
By far too time consuming. Make it simple devs,
Most of the features are not available. Other non-native todoist apps are better.,
"Can't even test out the app properly without going premium: labels, filters and sync more than once a day are not available to try until you upgrade! Crazy....",
"I really like the design, it is stylish and offers a really nice user experience. Also the app is very useful, couldn't help not buying the premium version. Way to go!",
I'm a paid subscriber and never had an issue with unlimited syncs. Nice user interface makes it a breeze to enter new tasks. Good work.,
Really pleased with this app. User interface is attractive. Service is flexible and easy to use. Very good overall.,
not sure what the app is like behind the login wall.,
"Frequent crashes, galaxy s3. Still, nice to have a real mobile app! (update) now less crashing. Thanks!",
"Adding a task for today with time 'Today at 9am', creates a task which will be for the day before a 9am.  Lack of sync more than one time a day is too bad.",
"On first login, please update to AUTOMATICALLY REFRESH so that tasks appear!",
"Basic app, would be more useful if integrated with wedoist.",
"Great, but needs a widget.",
"No widget, no me gusta",
For review details about this app follow @hipsterandroid on twitter.,
"No widget, poor functionality and 28$/y?",
"Good job guys, but where are subtasks? Where are settings for app & widgets?",
"The app is simple which I like and it is well made, but it needs some more functionalities such as show all tasks, or preferably own queries, notifications on the phone. It should be more intergrated and not as much stand alone app.",
"Don't think so.  I had high hopes for this app, but they need a different pricing model before I even consider it.  Shame too, because the interface looks great.   UPDATE: even the Black Friday discount isn't good enough. Make it a one time purchase and I will buy.",
When I try to put in a due date for something it puts in a completely different date. It doesn't matter if I key in the entire date using numbers and slashes or if I choose the date from the menu button that's a clock. if I put in December fifth of this year it puts the due date down as may of 2013,
Really cool and very polished but the only thing stopping me from using as a daily driver AND upgrading to premium is the lack of Google tasks sync. It has all my lists and tasks and I've been using it for years for how reliable it has always been so all I ask is to get sync like the Tasks app on the play store and this is an easy 6. And not a monthly charge I can't afford that lol,
Why pay for features others give for free. The desktop client is merely a Web browser. If you're looking for a serious multi platform productivity suite try Producteev.,
"Beautiful UI but missing a lot of features like Google tasks sync, not mature enough to pay for the yearly premium service but improve the app imho",
Whenever I put a date on something it gives me a totally different date... I have to use abbreviations to get what i want,
"Emailing me daily! Really, I'm sure I can change it in the settings but why! Makes no sense why I would want them to email me to push product when I was using it. Uninstalled",
The mobile website of todoist did not suit my needs on a mobile device. I was really looking forward to this app and finally it's here! The layout is well-designed and the functionality is great.,
"I love this apps. It helps me to become a more organise person. I hope to get premium apps, but it's too pricy! :/",
"Installed, saw reminders are a premium (i.e., paid) feature, uninstalled.",
"Finally, a decent native app for Todoist! Great work guys; particularly like the drag-n-drop reordering (long-press).  Only a couple of things would make this even better - support in notes for basic formatting (*bold*, /italic/ _underlined_ etc), linkable phone numbers in tasks or task notes? Also, hiding items that aren't tasks (subtasks I've created with a * before them) shouldn't really show up in ""items with no due date"".  Otherwise, great stuff!",
"I tried to use the option for syncing the app to my Google account,  but instead of actually syncing,  the app sat with a thing that said it was working on syncing and wouldn't finish loading.   I tried exiting out of the app and reentering,  but it still said it was syncing.   I even checked to make sure WiFi was working,  and I found that the WiFi was at its peak of performance.   The loading continued and has not stopped.  It will not allow me to cancel the request to sync it with my Google account.",
"It's not a very intuitive interface. I wanted to add a sample project with a few mock tasks and couldn't figure it out within 5 minutes so I uninstalled. The quick task widget only allows scheduling for the next three days, so putting something out into the future was a no go. I don't need a ton of bells and whistles but a good, ucd interface and decent scheduling capability are important .",
"I like the app but why would anyone pay $28.99 / year for features that you can get elsewhere for free.   If they charged a reasonable fee up front for a full version of the app,  I would go for that.  But,  until then,  Todoist still can't touch Any.do. Uninstalled!",
"Disappointing. Free version has no access to any of the actually useful things (such as setting reminders and putting tasks into categories). If you want access to these things you have to pay a yearly fee. Definitely not worth it when you can do all of this on Google calendar, Samsung calendar or other equivalent for free.",
Hi the problem is that sometimes when I complete tasks on Android they still show up as incomplete on Windows. This is even after Syncing a couple of times. I am a premium member. Thanks for the prompt response. Would love a feature to keep strings of daily tasks for habits like 21 days.,
"Very well polished app with great companion webapp. Very smart with location reminders, way better than GKeep. My only real gripe is the HUGE font on the widget. Each item is way too big; I'd like to have the option to size down my font so I can fit more tasks on my widget without scrolling.",
"Getting better all the time. Win10 app still buggy, frustrating to have 
huge project's tasks shuffled together. But ""Android APP"" and ""browser 
based app on Win10 laptop"" are good. Fine-motor skill needed to do task 
reordering on phone but it works. 10 second or so UnDo button after making 
a move so oops is not so tragic. 5 ☆",
"UI-wise it's very pretty, but a key feature is locked behind its Premium mode - reminders. This is the only thing I require and since I'm not eager to pay 28 pounds a year for a task app, I unfortunately have to skip Todoist. Check it out yourself, maybe you'll find the other Premium features worthy of a subscription.",
"This app does a good job of keeping up with my honeydo list, but, without the expensive subscription, lacks some important details. For example, daily notifications only list the number of items current/overdue; one must actually start the app to see the list. It's too easy, then, to just ignore items. Uninstalled and will try something else.",
I like todoist but it takes forever to switch projects. It's like there is an animation and then it finally switches to the next project. Would be way better if it would just switch. Please fix. Ive been using free G-tasks in the meantime. (I have a todoist subscription),
"I installed to see if it is different from other to do apps, its not, the ui is still disappointingly old paradigm, and the fact that filters and labels which are local features are premium only for 28 dollars a year bothers me. I don't mind paying for cloud synch, but I'm not going to pay that much just to see if lables and filters work how I want, though they don't look like they work how I want anyway.",
"I love this app becuase it is very easy to create and do tasked becuase you can create different groups and sub-groups but I wish that it had reminder support for free or they made it that you buy it out right instead of paying out each year,If so then would get an easy 5 stars",
I don't ever write reviews... And I usually dislike when I'm prompted to; but honestly this app deserves my time as it has saved me so much. Todoist is the pillar of my productivity after using it for multiple years. It takes time to find your flow with it but the customizations give you many opportunities to tweak the system to your liking.,
"I didn't like this app, before you can even do anything it wants you to login to it.  Secondly, they have a pro version but instead of selling a better app (at a one time fee), they want a yearly subscription.  For these 2 reasons I uninstalled and went with something else.",
"Way, way to expensive for me. I wanted to use this now and again. Maybe people who are heavy uses may find the £21.99 a year reasonable but for me I would only pay a tenth of that. The free version is not great as it doesn't allow sync to google calender. I found an app called Wunderlist that allows me to sync for free so although a nice looking app, uninstalled",
had an idea of utilizing this before since my life is totally random and i dont have any sort of fixed roune stopped halfway cuase its not really helping until i saw an animer that pushed me back.. no game no life.. anyway hope i can pull throughthis time,
"Ive tried many to do apps before and think this one is a great combination of simplicity and functionality.  Gret interface too.  To monthy fee to unlock the really useful features kills it for ke. I buy the pqid version of apps i use, and pay premium for apps i love. But i cannot justify subscribing, paying who knows what over time, and losing the features when i thougt ive paid enouh. Sorry devs.",
"It's quick and easy to jot down a note and shedule it. Easy to move or 
reschedule. Also, their help is helpful if you have questions. I asked how 
to get a task to stay on a regular date even if I put it off for a day. 
Turns out the answer was to right click and its treated a little 
differently without indication. I guess what I want to say is there's more 
than meets the eye, even for free and it serves all my work to do lists.",
I'm using free version and it's ok. Would be great if I can have the following:  1. Sort by date then by priority. Right now can only have either or.  2. And once you choose how to sort it should stay that way but it doesn't. So Everytime I have to sort the way I like.  3. In each task if we can add notes that would be great as well.,
"I have used many To-do apps in my search for the perfect one. I've used everything from Google Keep to Wunderlist and this one blows them all out of the water! It does it all from repeatable tasks to sub-tasks and notes for tasks, priorities, labels and color coding. The $30 for Pro for a year is easily the best $30 I've spent all year. Kudos to the team for their work on this one!",
"I need a tasklist with a calendar interface. It would be way more efficient to click a day and a time instead of having to type ""Oct 7th at 8pm"".... Taking 300%-500% to longer to schedule a task becomes a big deal when you're trying to add 50+ unique tasks.",
"The new interface is terrific. However, not having reminders in the base app and charging $30 a year for them is a deal breaker. Reminders are a critical part of any task management app, and to pull those out and incorporate them into a premium package that cost $30 a year seems wrong. Most other task management apps include reminders. I might be willing to pay a small one-time fee to add reminders, but not a costly subscription model bundling other features I don't need.",
"If you are not premium, you can not get the basic things like notifications when you have to do a task. This is a basic thing that the others apps offer for free, so I don't know why I have to pay to get this feature.  I'm switching to another service until I have at least one kind of notification without the need to go premium.",
"If you want a notification a task is due, you have to pay $30 a year.  There's no leeway on this.  I'm fine with all the other awesome organizational and syncing things being behind the pay wall, as well as emil and sms reminders.  A reminder popping up in my notification shade I should not have to pay $30 a year for.",
Google Keep can give reminders for upcoming events without costing £20. Charging that not only once but *every year* is ludicrous for the average non-business user. I just want to be reminded of my due to-do list items - that shouldn't cost more than £1 a year. I suggest the developers offer a personal version without the fancy team and multi-user features for a few pounds a year at most.,
Orang OCD macam saya kena ade ni. Just change from manual handwriting planner to app. Easy to use for tech newbies.  And u can use on ur pc or mobile phone. Will upgrade to premium just to pay to appreciate their works.,
"This has got to be the dumbest developer in the world....lets make a reminder app, but make people pay 30 bucks a year for actual notifications and NOT put that cost in our description of this crappy app. Lets put ""get instant notifications for updates"" in there to be vague and hope no one gets to the premium description telling these idiot consumers that they have to pay 30 bucks for push notifications, emails or SMS reminders. Good luck to the people who actually paid up.",
Beautiful design and had really high hopes until I saw reminders were a premium feature. This is a core requirement for any to do app and putting it behind a paywall really ruins the usefulness of Todoist.   I'll stick with any.do - Uninstalled in under 5 minutes,
"This App seems to be functional.  There is nagging to get the premium (ie complete) product.  I was expecting this to be something like a $5 or £3 one off payment as most are. In reality it is $30 a year which to my mind is an outrageous price for something that MIGHT be a bit better than free or very cheap alternatives.   The urging to buy the complete product got on my wick so i have uninstalled  and gone for ""ultimate to do list"" .  which seems very good for a reasonable one off payment.",
"Nice to have a well executed to-do list. However, it constantly has premium features (like reminders and labels) that you cannot use in the way. You might try to use these simple not premium features and be asked to upgrade to use. The cost is far too expensive ($28/yr) for a single user who just wants a reminder. I'd pay $5 once for more features. I can use the built-in (free) Google launcher reminders.",
Have been using it for 2 years now. App is great. But adding new task fast is little complicated. You have to click it once more to change its default folder from Inbox to the folder you want.,
"This app is really good and I loved it, however, the fact that reminders are a premium feature is not a good thing. I know you guys need to get users to sign up for premium but reminders are a very basic task and it would be so much better if it weren't a paid feature.",
"The app had an eye-catchy design and a start up planner on how to do your task. It has a friendly approach so that's a plus. But, the good part was in premium. So a free user like me has a hard time to cope up with my task because it doesn't have any reminders. Yes, I know, it needs to have a paywall so the creator behind the app can earn money for themselves. But, I'll just put my critics here to tellfree users like me. Anyways, good job. I really like your app.",
"I was searching for a  minimalistic to-do list and this most certainly is one. To be honest I only messed with it for a short time, but the UI was smooth, minimal and organized. I started filling in my tasks and went to add a reminder for one when it prompted me to upgrade the app. You have to pay for reminders? As I said, from what I can tell this is a great app, but I'm not paying $30 (for a year) just for the convenience of reminders.",
"After much hesitation and searching,  I jumped from countless todo apps to Todoist and now I am wondering why I didn't do it sooner. If you follow gtd or just want plain todo tracking app, Todoist will fit your needs. App is extremely intuitive and flows naturally (Reminders,  labels (contexts),  folders and priorities are based on natural language interpretation) as you download stuff from brain to app. Best feature is Google Now integration that captures Note/Due Date better than Siri. Thank You 4 app.",
"The biggest thing you need with a task app is sync between systems, but you will not be able to test that more than once a day.  No X day trial of full features and WOW $30 a year.  What I could test looks nice.",
The app wasn't bad but in the free version you couldn't set reminders...which is something I wanted to test before paying.  Also I got bombarded with emails about getting premium etc etc. I have uninstalled the app since the free version was more of a hassle than a help. Not to mention I can use my Google calendar for alerts and it's free.,
"Another app that is overly complicated and forces you to give them all your information, so that they can sell it to the entire world, before they will allow you to use the app.  Personally, because of my line of work, I am NOT allowed a Facebook or Twitter account. I wish someone could learn to make a simple, useful, easy to understand application, without sucking every drop of blood from you!",
"Finally a fantastic free service. I tried many many others, and todoist 
really jumped out. Works flawlessly with my workflow, with an integrated 
mail add-on, a phone app, windows desktop program, and a browser tab. 
Simple and efficient to add tasks, type in text based due dates such as 
""everyday starting in 5 days"" and it will recognise it, use # to 
categorise, it's quick and easy and that's the most important thing for an 
organiser. Will be purchasing the yearly premium service, not that I need 
it, but because these Devs deserve it",
"The ToDoist staff have turned the tides on my previously negative review. I'm a long time ToDoist enthusiast. I operate on my own and reached enlightened status over a year ago I think. Stopped counting after I reached that one. ToDoist, why not add some other states to reach? I know it's weird, but I've always been goal oriented and reaching that intangible status actually made me more productive. Aside from that, thank you for all the recent changes. And continually improving your product.",
3.99 a month just to be able to add notes to a project is a blatant rip off.  Shouldn't cost more than 2.99 ONCE for this 'option'  Syncing may be a 'premium' feature. Adding a note is not. Requiring a premium fee every month for BASIC functionality is still a ripoff no matter what your excuse.   P. S. Dropbox is free.,
"The app looks nice, but the scheduling interface is extremely confusing. There is no option  to open a calendar and pick a date or time, and recurring items are almost impossible to schedule (as in, every month on the first). I gave up on trying to figure out this interface, and the help is almost nonexistent. It's anything but intuitive.",
"Only using free version, but it's the best to do app I have used (in 8+ years of Android use).  I'm not thrilled with subscription-based unlocked, tho.  The prospect of having my data held hostage over money turns me away instantly.",
"I downloaded this app after a recommendation from Mike Vardy of the Productivityist.  His advice and Todoist have changed my life! I feel way less stressed with my new task focused schedule,  I could not do it without Todoist.  Functionality is great,  and I love that I can add labels and sort tasks in different ways. A++.",
"This is the best note taking app on Google Play. Hands down. I've rated it 2 stars for the fact that just plain simple notifications are a premium feature. It is unbelievable some of the things that come free, but just a reminder for a task is a paid feature. I'm a college student in need of a good note app, and want to use this one but I can't. I need reminders! With out paying $30 a year for them. Therefore, I have to continue using keep.",
I've tried this many times before but the inclusion of Amazon Echo UK integration is fantastic and works very well for my needs. Will now definitely keep using this program now and has actually helped be start getting things done..,
I downloaded this app so I could have a free organized to-do list that would remind me when I have something due coming up but found out quickly that its reminder feature (via push notifications) you must have premium to use (meaning you'd have to pay extra). It defeated the purpose of having it for me; I am not willing to pay extra for it so I uninstalled the app.,
"Todoist has been my to do list app of choice for nearly 3 years. I've tried others but come back because it's so good. Fast, lean and flexible app. The paid features are worth it and cost less for a year than you'll pay for a dinner out. I am not compensated by todoist, I just think it's the best option and I'm not a cheap ass",
"On iOS and OS X, OmniFocus reigns pretty much without threat as the best task manager, specially for those who follow GTD principles. For those of us who want a solution that works cross platform, there haven't been any serious options. It wasn't until quite recently Todoist got to a level of functionality that made it a worthy replacement. After 2 years of looking, I finally felt that there was a task manager that would allow me to switch to Android. Go for the paid version, it has better functionality.",
"Beyond creating Projects which are more like folders and adding tasks with a due date, almost every other feature is listed as a Premium feature and unavailable including reminders. Hence the 3 stars which is generous IMO. If you are not making all those features available the version labeled as free on play store, then as far as I am concerned, that is not what was advertised. Such  bait-n-switch tactics reallyname me mad. It may be a great app in the premium edition but it doesn't have the basic features for a decent to do app. Uninstalled it! The hunt continues...",
"After trying out a bunch of todo apps, I've settled for Todoist and it 
hasn't disappointed me so far. The app is intuitive yet rich in features. 
Sync speed is top notch, better than any app I've tested. The design could 
be revamped to be more exciting, maybe follow Google's updated material 
design language. There's nothing to complain in it's current state however. 
Highly recommended. Looking forward to using Todoist for a long time.",
The computer application from what I've seen so far is good but I've tried both Playstore & Google downloads on my phone & after 2 days am frustrated as I can't get it to install. I have a Samsung 6 but my work partner has a Apple & he said he was having similar problems. Would love to give this app a serious try. Help!,
I reluctantly started using this app because it was required at my office. I am really glad that we made the move even though the learning curve was a little high. This app is very flexible and allows you to tailor the use toward personal or corporate needs.,
"Would appreciate it if more features are included such as: display tasks according to dates for longer period of time (not just next 7 days), able to sync tasks with google calendar or outlook calendar app",
"Though every other feature is for premium account, it still gets the basic job done. My fav feature is the web-to-phone synchronization cuz i hate typing stuff into the phone. Todoist lets me type on my laptop n transfers the list to my phone. Greatest relief eva!",
Love this app and keep trying to get the tech-phobics in my office to try it. Super easy to use and for me the best feature is the integration with gmail. I've tried all of the major task managers out there and todoist wins hands down for me. I have now upgraded to premium but you don't need that at all to make it work for you. I used the free version for probably a year.  Love this app!,
"Can't say much, just didn't like it or the way it appeared and worked. Wasn't for me. I really don't understand why it was so highly rated in on-line reviews. I needed certain features but not all the bells and whistles of some apps. You need to see what you like, need and how easy it is to use, yourself.",
"Seems like this app is a joke because I can neither log in, sign up or sign through google. It just freezes on ""Please wait"" :D looked promising, turned out terrible.",
"Excellent thinking by developers, seriously had helped me better operate my daily life and  professional life.Some things i want developers to have a look at : 1. Expand collapse all function for subtasks,say i have 25 tasks and 5 subtasks for each of them, then while reviewing clicking each one of them manually makes things a bit complicated   2. Adding sub task difficult right now since it is added to last task by default , can Customized right swipe to the task be included to add a Sub task  OR just like clicking a task displays priority, label etc, can we have option of subtask displayed instead of being under menu 3. Add a switch to hide particular list from main list/parent list/filters too ? Some lists are just common items or maybe just including them in main list might disturb the logic flow.  4. Instead of having click the + icon can we have a quick add bar at bottom. 5. Comments are good, but can we have description segment for each task....  These are in no way shortcomings of the app but some of personal suggestions only.. Thanks a ton for developing such a quality app and keeping most of its features free and best of all adfree which not even 1% of apps are doing... I m surely looking fwd to being it's premium user.....",
"Clean design, excellent synchronisation, so far robust, subtasks and quite complicated recurrences. This has replaced remember the milk for me. Very simple and clear way to add tasks on the phone or tablet. One star knocked off because of the slightly convoluted and unintuitive methods for making a subtask or doing complicated reminders such as ""recycle garden waste every 2 weeks from this thursday"". Both things can be done but are much easier on the web.",
"It doesn't sync with Google Tasks, rather only with its own proprietary servers. It is also essentially a demo in my book, as notifications are central to task management and that's a premium only feature. It is, however, pretty. And if you don't mind paying, and don't mind lack of Google Tasks sync, then it may work for you.",
"The app is probably good for large groups that require advanced collaboration options. For personal use,  I would rather stick to Keep. It allows me to create notes,  sync & organize them, share them, add images  and set up time/location reminders. All this for free with just your Google account. Now why in the world would I create a new account and pay for using your app?",
Unfortunately free version is a little bit limited. After using full version I feel lack of functionality. But still using it because it's cool and simple,
"Completely aggravating. Put in a reminder for an event, then adding the time; if I add any other numbers to the reminder (such as an address) it starts pushing those numbers into the date/time part of the reminder in the highlighted red box. Useless and deleted app.",
Probably has the potential to be the best app in its category on Play Store. Too bad they make you pay $30 yearly subscription fee for basic features like reminders and notifications. I don't mind paying for apps. But $30/year is ridiculus.,
"Have just switched to Android from iPhone and biggest concern was being able to find a replacement for ""Things"", an app I thought was irreplaceable. Turns out that ToDoist is much more feature-rich, but can be either as simple or complex as meets requirements because the more advanced features don't obscure the basic functionality. Have always avoided subscription software until now as well, but have subscribed to ToDoist (5p a day!) because the service is constantly updated, rather than expensive updates.",
"It's been over 30 minutes and it still haven't installed. Something is wrong. For all i know its just stealing my information. Who the heck knows. Apps don't usually take that long to install. I've washed dishes, cleaned the house, checked my emails. WTH?",
"Couldn't go beyond creating an account and adding a task. Bam! What a surprise! You can't have reminders without having premium subscription! This is a very basic feature (maybe THE feature in GTD) and practically makes the free version useless. I won't proclaim myself as a power user, so I don't need to make 200 projects in this app. I need an app which allows me to create a few projects and add reminders for each task. And I think that should come free. Can't really see the greatness of this app, sorry.",
"I tested this in a Windows-syncing-with-Android configuration. The Windows installer failed initially, which was disturbing enough on its own. Then I had a sync bug (task duplication) in a trivial case within the first few minutes of use. Quickly abandoned after that, as that's totally unacceptable for productivity software. This seems to be one of those apps that's better at self-promotion than fulfilling its remit. Working on every platform too often means you don't work on any of them. There are competitors that do all this and more, better. Except perhaps the marketing.",
Rip off garbage. Did not refund my 28.00 even after uninstalled in one minute of installing. Reporting to Florida attorney general office,
"Deleted my 2-star review just to make it 1-star. It was 2 stars because of app limitations etc.  Now on topic. I've deleted this app about 10 days ago. For the next few days i went on, following the email link to unsubscribe from ""todoist digest"", telling me i ""unsubscribed succesfully"" just to have it come back the next day. I also added it to spam from my email client, but it kept on coming. Finally it stopped.   I thought it was because after unsubscribing three or four days in a row they finally got the message. It wasn't. Ten minutes ago i checked out my spam folder, just to find eight more messages, one every day. I ""unsubscribed succesfully"" yet again and now i'm looking into other ways of reporting them for the constant spam i receive.",
"One of my colleagues mentioned this service and I decided to check it out. Simply put, there is no better task management solution out there. I now have all of my tasks broken down by project and synced in Outlook, on my phone and tablet, in Chrome through the extension and I can also do everything on the web. The premium service is totally worth the money as it allows for push notifications, turning emails into tasks in Outlook, adding notes and attachments to tasks and so much more. I cannot say enough great things about Todoist!",
I LOVE the interface. But decided to not use it in the end as it doesn't have the subtask function which I find essential. Am aware of the project function but it's troublesome to create a project for a task that you plan to finish in a day. Would definitely use this if there's a subtask function.,
"What the creators of this app think it'd one of the apps strong selling points is what actually makes this app a nightmare to use. I am referring to task scheduling using ""plain language"". Google does not allow enough space here for me to list all of the problems this creates but if your app has a tutorial on the syntax required to schedule tasks, then you have a problem. Another thing... Where I live, all months do not have 30 days. Some have 31 or even less. Ev month should not turn into ev 30 days.",
"I don't like an app that says it's free but useless unless you purchase the pro app. Call it a trial and let me try it so I can decide if it works for me and is worth purchasing.  Not being able to make notes, in the free app, makes it useless.  Installed and uninstalled - Bam! Moving on to another solution.",
"New phone,  thought I'd try it again.  Couldn't get the thing past the setup screen.  Tried using my Google account and tried setting up a new account.   Both methods hung up trying to do something.  I give up on it. LG G3",
"Customer support was fantastic and gave me a few trial on the premium so that I could test all the features, but the reoccurring task options were too limited, for my needs. UI was legit, as was most of the other options. I don't mind them charging for the full feature set either, I just couldn't justify spending it without better reoccurring task options. I recommend SplenDO or TickTick.",
Todoist helps me keep track of a lot of my important projects that will fall by the wayside if I don't have a reminder. Also I get a sense of accomplishment when I complete all my tasks in a day. It's a really useful tool!,
"Loved it at first until I discovered you have to pay a one year fee of $30 for something as basic as notifications. Despite it seeming worth it, I won't risk another wunderlist. (notification fail) which is why I thought I'd make the change in the first place. Still from my initial testing  I liked it alot.",
This version (free) is missing any kind of notification system making it basically unusable as a to do list.,
Have been using omnifocus for a couple of years.  Paid quite a bit on that platform.  Was looking around when i changed to a android. Will still use todoist if one day i used back a iphone today,
"Not intuitive! Am usually fine without a ""How to"" but this app is just to complicated for me. I prefer To Do from microsoft as it's simple enough but does the job. There are no ways to make recurring tasks with reminders (Birthdays?!) and only 5 folders are allowed in standard which is useless. I refuse to pay monthly for a simple app like this. Maybe 20.- for lifetime. When you first start out there are a million notification mails and tasks set up by the app that you have to delete manually.",
"I thought I'd give it a shot because I like to change the way things look on my phone. Everything was going fine until it asked me to upgrade to a premium version for just a REMINDER to my task! I mean.. Seriously? I could just 'ok google, remind me at xyz to do abc' and even that's free. Sad.",
This looks like a great app.. However the unavailability of 'Reminder' which is a basic feature for any task manager is missing in this version.. Agree that this is a free version.. However I feel like basic features should be added to the free version and the premium features can be charged.. I was unable to try this app for more than a day due to the lack of reminders..,
the app is good for remaining organised but the prob is i cant hear any notifications/vibrations on the start of any task.. We shudnt hv to chek mobile every nw and then to know whether theres any upcoming task or not.. please fix this.. otherwise a nice app..,
"This is very beautifully designed app, but main function missing here is it doesn't sent notification in phone and rather mails it... try bringing it for all users",
"From scheduling a giant ""To Do"" list to managing multiple ""Projects"" this application is simply INCREDIBLE!  Keeps me on task,  coordinated with key colleagues,  customers and friends.  To the design Team ""Thank You for your hard work designing a dynamic tool for the well organized to the folks with Adult ADD!"" One of the very very rare applications that does what it says it will do and haven't had a single glitch with the app!    P.S. -My wife wants me to thank you!  This app is good for marriages too!",
"I paid the subscription and then cancelled it a day later. This is almost two months ago and until today, although promised, they didn't refund me the yearly fee. They mention you can request a refund within 30 days. Yeah right .... rip off. So everyone be aware if you subscribe that you won't get any cent back if you change your mind.",
Have been using this app on a Mac PC iPhone Android tsbket/phone and iPad for a couple of years now.  Just haven't found anything that comes close to ToDoist,
"Not nearly as intuitive as I was hoping it would be. I like the sales pitch of Todoist, and I was about to purchase a year of the service via Humble Bundle, but this app turned me off it. Not nearly enough options when creating tasks. I didn't even see a way to have a task repeat every day or week.",
"If you are looking for something to push you acomplish goals with more efficiency, this is the app you need.  It is really user-friendly and helpful",
"Clean it up. Get rid of all the auto crap. I want my home page to be open projects, not a specific project.",
This app is slick. I love the interface. I would use it constantly if I didn't have to pay 28.99 USD a year to categorize my tasks. That's a basic function of every other to do list. Freemium at its worst,
"I thought it would combine my Google calendar, which already works great for me with my multiple email accounts. Todoist isn't worth the effort.",
"Apps for all devices, simplistic and smooth. Just have A hard time paying a subscription for a to do list. Should be a once time fee. I'd pay, but Im having a hard time justifying $31 a year.",
"This is probably my favorite to do  manager - and I've tried a lot - but I'm going back to 2do because there I can get all the functionality I need for a one-time upgrade fee. I want Todoist to provide task alarms/notifications, but not at the cost of $29 a year. Ouch! But they seem to be getting subscribers, so hard to fault their business plan, even if I don't like it....",
I Like that Karma Points as well as The Reminders And the Simplicity of it makes it too easy to Keep Up With What You've done Or forgot to do.,
"Instead of helping me manage tasks, this is just one more intrusive app reminding me of stuff. I need something that works with my calendar, not outside of it. I can see how this app might be useful to some, but it does not enhance my online experience. Two stars.",
I don't even see most of the features I expect to find in a to do list.  I'm not interested in a trial to the premium service. If you didn't impress me with the free version I don't want to try anything else.,
"Recently taken on extra position at work and love how I can divide out talks and prioritize the m. I see this from all the computers, tablets and phone with syncing streamline.  Great app",
"Very nice looking app, like the idea of the projects and being able to share. Unfortunately a vital part of this is not available without paying for it. Reminders!! Very strange as this would normally be standard. Uninstalled & very disappointed in what looked like a promising app.",
I have compared all best To Do apps. Todoist stands out from all of them. I really want to use this app but it's free version is not doing the most basic thing - REMINDER! I found out that free version creates auto reminder before 30 mins but it's not working on my phone. I'm using latest CM nightly on Nexus 4. Is this a bug or a feature? Without reminder there is no point using a To Do app :),
Can't give any stars if the program will  not sign me in through google as the login screen prompts  would like to give more but gotta see it 1st.,
"Love all about it. Did not need the premium features yet, helps me organise all my tasks ar home, work, etc and quickly add any idea from my mobile.",
It's a good app until you wanna set up the reminders and then you have to pay for it.... I just want a good reminder app for free.,
I had a recurring task to pay a credit card bill and it worked every month for 2 months then it didn't show up on the 3rd and for the first time ever I was late.  Cancelled subscription and uninstalled.,
"Has ability to delete accounts, etc.  What am I gaining by letting a to do list have so my power on my phone?  Being able to contact colleagues is not worth the loss of peace of mind.",
"Without a connection to Google+ this app becomes an exercise in frustration, reentering data again and again. Not worth it just bin it.",
Incredibly detailed app. Doesn't get much better. YouTube training available at all levels,
"Useless without £21.99 per year. All useful tools are unavailable for free use. This is a demo of an app, not an app. I loathe corporate lies.",
I've used about a dozen of the competitors to this product and none really even come close.  My advise is to forget the price and just buy it.  It isn't worth your time fiddling with the alternatives.,
Could you stop please send me notifications.. i am not interested in your app anymore.. please put option in your email to unsubscribe or delete account,
The 4 stars is for the excellent customer service.  I had to take at least one away due to the fact it's a pretty worthless app for the price.,
"For those of us who enjoy marking things as Done, it is great plus, I don't lose tasks and I like the prioritization.",
"Great app! I really don't understand people that complain about what they get for free. If you don't like it, don't buy the premium. Just move. I'm actually amazed at how much I do get for free and feel guilty that I don't need the premium. Anyway developers, the bug I'm experiencing is that my default screen is ""Today"" but it shows one of my projects instead. It doesn't do this on the widget, thankfully, only when I open it. Keep up the good work! I just found out yesterday and added integrations. I can't wait to start using them! Thanks for being awesome!",
I try another app than pay yearly. if pay once only I will consider.,
"Todoist said it's free, but the free version is so limited as to be useless. They want to charge you for everything wunderlist doors better for free.",
"I've been using Todoist for a long time via browser, desktop app and thunderbird. This was the piece that was missing. Impressed about being able to drag and drop my tasks to easily prioritise my days on the go and to be able to sync all my devices! Congrats",
Great app but computer version needs to be more atractive even in a full screen mode. But for the mobile version i give 5star here :),
"Not many features available in the free version so can't really test it. But otherwise looks good and fast and seems quite capable. Would like a paid version with my own server (privacy,  anyone?) and an annual licence so you can get your money but most probably it won't happen :-) Best regards!",
An elegant cross-platform solution that combines versatility with simplicity.  The user interface is a delight compared with others.,
LG g10 works great on my phone. Not too complicated. Gives karma incentives for using it. Check it out. Great for positive reinforcement and getting things done.,
"just another way for google to make money on ""upgrading"" to the premium model, which costs. all I wanted was a handy check list I could customize to help my day to day activities stay more organized. (please note you can use this app in its free version however you cannot customize ANYTHING) if I was going to PAY for organization I would simply hire someone to do it for me. I don't need to be organized so badley I would pay for a stupid electronic check list. I'll use a pen and paper, thanks.",
Thanks for listening to my previous complaints about limiting the sync ability for non-premium users. This makes this one of the most user-friendly and polished TODO list apps in the play store without a doubt.,
"Let's me decide what I want to work on and gives me a good sense of progress. Simple, beautiful enough UI that just works and gets out of my way. Excellent product. Hasn't failed me once.",
"I would be lost without it, email, text and location reminders have helped 
me complete tasks without fail. It is well worth t to purchase they pro 
version",
You can only schedule tasks on dates .no precision coz time scheduling is not included.you are better off using regular calendar on your phone,
"Great way to start and end the day to stay on top of things. Premium version helps much more with location reminders, more colors,  and attachments. Wish I could do even more levels to detail out some projects even further.",
"It doesn't work without an account, I just wanted to use it offline but it 
didn't let me or the skip step was well hidden. So I uninstalled it.",
"Excellent, fully featured to do app with an interface that makes it very fast to add and organize your tasks.",
Easy to use and very helpful. I can set up my to do list from home that way I keep track of everything I have to do.,
Particularly like that this sits on my phone and my pc. Most of the time it's very easy to add new tasks,
"Excellent, fast, speedy little app. The design is simplistic in nature and easy to use, but tasks sometimes do not appear in the desktop version even after syncing",
"I use it every day, it's improved a lot over the last few months/years. I pay for the full service and I'm not at all disappointed by it. If it integrated well with Gmail calendar it'd be perfect.",
"Heard lots of good things about this app, and decided to try it out.  Was decent, but nothing impressive as Astrid, Any.do and others.",
"Really good application, I work on the move and reduces weight of handbags .would be even better with reminders that sync with calendar",
Makes a difference doing the little things like having a list. This one works very well,
"You have to purchase a subscription to have reminders, so there's no point to even downloading it unless you plan on getting a subscription. I hate when apps try to trick you that way.",
They charge extra for things that should be included. I'll stick with Google Calendar and their task list.,
"Tired to install but couldn't even get passed the log in screen. Gave up 
after ten minutes of the loading wheel",
"Easier task setting than other popular programs, and the app company sends emails reminding you of your tasks, as well as tips for staying on track and using ToDo in its full potential.",
"I found the majority of the features I really wanted were ""premium"" so I uninstalled it in favor of Microsoft To Do which has all the features I'm looking for at no charge.",
"Read a recommendation for this, created a test item, add a reminder, requires premium, add label, requires premium, click on the icons, requires premium.  Bad sign when you can't even test an app. Android Wear seemed basic, but maybe that's also premium.  Wouldn't be so bad if you at least automatically got a trial period.",
This app is the best of its kind on the market but maybe if the new update comes with a portion for price tag. Will be awesome.,
"I can:t see how to sync tasks with my calendar, which is a stated feature but I can:t see how to make it happen. Apart from this, it is the easiest and therefore most effective to do all I've seen.",
I tried using it for school stuff since it has a due date...but it doesn't put it as stuff I could do that day. Other that it was very organized and I can see people using it. It just wasn't very useful for me personally.,
The most important feature of a to-do apps are alarm reminder. But this app needs premium membership to enable that feature. However other apps provide that feature for free.,
"Its a good app. But no doubt its expensive. For future improvement, please make the calendar integration n sync better. One more thing, please enable completed tasks in the app as well.",
"I don't need to sign in to use a to list, you intrusive noesy pos app. Here have one star rating.",
I added a few tasks to try this app then uninstalled after a few days but the task and upgrade emails keep on coming. Very irritating.,
Todoist has come a long way. It is now full of useful and powerful features that work beautifully across my devices. Without it my life would be much harder to organize.,
This is the perfect to do app. And many good features at free version. Currently using chrome extension and android app. Great job by developers.,
"App has standard functionality for manage task/activity list but free version is without any of these and ""pro"" version is similar to other free apps.  Out of real market",
This is my task management solution for work and home. Very reliable and convenient given I can forward emails to my projects and it responds to natural language inputs.,
"Looking for a more Google centric solution.  If you make a mistake on login, it creates a new account and spams your email.",
"I use it across Mac, Android, iOS and Web. Best Android-compatible Things.app replacement that I've found.  Appreciate they they're shipping regular updates.",
Fantastic design and cross device compatibility. Best of 3 to do apps i've tried. Great chrome extension too.,
You can make lists and share them..that's it without a premium account. You can not see completed tasks and can't add notes or files to tasks without a premium account. There are other better free applications out there.,
"Too many of the options I need are only in the premium. Was not able to 
really test it enough to feel like I wanted to pay for the app. I would 
have liked a little more flexibility to evaluate if it is a good fit for me",
"How much is the price of the premium todoist, i accidentally uninstalled it and cant download again(bcz slow internet) so i cant see the price",
"I didn't find the option to make tasks more detailed, not even free text. With labels disabled in the free version this app is not offering any benefit to me.",
Would be a great 5 star app if premium features were being sold for 5 or 10$ outright.,
I love this  app very much because it helps me remember everything that I have to do. You should also check out this app.,
Add more functions to this. The work that is due should move to the next day...also the option to copy a task and to set it for multiple days,
"I hated the fact that I had to pay for the very most basic features, I don't mind paying for more advanced features but reminding alarms are fairly basic and you should not have to pay for them. You should learn to reel the customer in first make them love it and then they'll pay for it.",
This is one of the best apps for tasks i have ever used.  I love the Chrome plug-in. The only thing i wish the app amd extension had would be a drag and drop from email.,
This app is really helpful and detailed the way you did the tour. I saw that you sat down and took your time instead of rushing. And people if your reading you should download! This man or women took their time to make this.,
I've tried several to do apps. This is the one I stuck with. Does what I need and easy to use.,
"Every feature I tried to test was locked unless I paid money. None of my google tasks appeared, despite me attaching my google account. Unintuitive and unimpressive.",
The update to google layout and functionalities are simply incredible! Makes me feels much more comfortable! The app helps a lot to keep things organized! Missing only one feature: sync with google calendar. But it is definitely a 5 star app.,
"Why do I have to sign in with my Google details ? All I wish to do is set some simple reminders on my Galaxy Note 2. On my iphone 4 its easy just go to calendar and do it no problem. Why is Samsung and Android and Google such CRAP. I can't wait to get rid of all three of them, Android apps are rubbish, and so is GN2.",
Staying organized had never been easier! This is quite possibly the most powerful free app on the market. Every professional should have the included versatile widget on their home screen. Thank you.,
This app is less stressful than most. It annoys me enough (in a good way)  to handle my need to do items and makes take time for myself! I'm hooked! Thanks,
"Todoist is absolutely perfect for my business and personal productivity. Loving it. I integrate other services with it, and have developed a healthy obsession with checking items off my Today screen.",
Can't imagine a to do app without reminders.  As well not have the app then.  Uninstalling.  You can get any.do and all these features for free,
I have always been a big to do list person. I have tried a few other apps but I have always reverted back to carrying around hand written lists. While I have only had this app for a short time it has kept me more organized than ever. Great app!!!!!,
"Non-intuitive GUI, almost useless in free mode, paid version TOO expensive	Difficult to navigate around. For simple todo list, there are Colornote (free) or Tasks ($1) which are much easier to use. To discover advanced feature, user is reqired to pay $3/month or $30/year. What a ripoff. No thanks, even free I'm not sure I like this app.",
"It does everything you could want it to do and more. There a few obvious things that could make it better, but it's easy to write a suggestion to the team and they respond promptly - good customer service!",
Features are so limited for free version. No notes and subtasks. Pricing for premium version then way too expensive. You guys must consider it. But good job on providing many platforms for this app.,
I use the paid version. It does absolutely eveverything I need to. Does not take a ton of time to fiddle around with. Not too steep of a learning curve at all.,
I really liked this app but had to switch because of unavailability of local reminders. Will surely come back if these are included.,
"Am using another app which is amazing , Wunderlist. I will see if this app can push me to switch. I doubt :)",
"You can't set comments, notes or reminders unless you pay to upgrade. The free version is pretty limited.",
This is more ex than TickTick by $9 and TickTick even have all the features from Todoist for free :(,
Makes being organised feel easier and look better! I've been using this app every day without fail since I got it and I've noticed a slow but huge improvement on my productivity during the day. I find it really easy to use now i've got the hang of it!,
Great app! Really need Task Duration field and sort ability by Hrs per task. Plz add this for 5 stars:) Thanks. -Long Time Premium User,
Got an email to get this free app. The app looks good but most of the other useful functions leads one to buy the premium plan that costs every month or per year. Just so that you know.,
"Okay, but doesn't integrate with other services like google, etc.  Not interested in having yet another account.  Deleted.",
Without reminders any to do list app is useless. In order to get reminders /notifications you have to pay for the one year. subscription.,
Great work capturing all my tests quickly. V feature request- tasks should be captured through voice as well like Siri or Google Assistant directly by todoist.,
Installed this app a few weeks ago. Really started to like it. Installed Windows 10 now I only get a blank screen on my laptop. If that don't work then I don't want the mobile app.,
This app is good and has a Google platform but to get notifications you have to pay yearly.  I'm not about to waste money on an app that I can get for free or use Microsoft,
Too difficult to work out how to use. After numerous attempts I gave up. I wanted to compile a list of things to do and the app just wouldn't let me.,
"The app is a very good choice overall, and I appreciate the natural language recognition.  However, its repertoire of scheduling setups is limited.",
I was unable to delete past events as they would reappear anyway. Also after uninstalling I'm still getting alert messages.,
"Don't know why the good reviews. Too basic and even comments, reminders and notifications require premium with paid subscription. Too many other ways of doing more with different ways even by using a simple calendar!",
"Works good in keeping track of your schedule, thought sometimes the notification system doesn't work well with my phone (S4). Keep it up!",
An excellent task tracker with lots of features and capabilities of combining it with other add-ons and programs like IFTTT and toggl.,
"This was a good app till you need to pay to use its most important functions, no ads which is a plus and most of its minor features are free.",
Too complicated I would suggest you to take a look on Google Keep.Well i am not asking you to make another app same to keep app but see the simplicity and ease of use in that app. I was just trying to find any alternative app perhaps with better features but i ended up seeing that Keep is better still.,
I don't need a to do list that is going to nag me to purchase a premium edition.... I'd rather use paper than this crap. Developers went off the deep end here.,
This app has helped me get and stay organised and it's good to see they are working on making it better. Give it a try and provide feedback.,
I liked it when i got it. It looked very good but it went downhill with all the features needed to be verh useful. So it's not the planning app for me.,
I've used this app for years and took a break to write pen and paper. I didnt expect to see them jump on the premium wagon but hey everyone needs to make money,
There is no function to repeats daily tasks (ex exercising daily).  It is an otherwise pretty app but I'll go back to remember the milk.,
"Free version is subpar at best. If you have a calendar you can already do all of the things todoist does and more. No alerts, no email synch, no calendar synch... what's the point? Having to open the app to see a to do list is pretty silly. The paid version sounds like it's better but again, your calendar will do everything this app does.",
"It keeps me on track. Let's me type it out quickly so I won't have to constantly be thinking of what I have to be doing. It lets me know what my priorities are, if I can't do something then I move it to another day.",
This is an amazing app and has really helped my move to Linux and losing Outlook. I upgraded and the extra functions are really useful,
"Update 2: quick add from permanent notification allows setting project. Not ideal but ok. Update: adding tasks is horrible now. I need to choose project but can't while entering. I way prefer dropdowns to typing codes. Have to enter then edit. A pain. //  I used TD before and it was good but when I got tired of Any.Do limitations and took another look, I was very impressed. Only thing really missing is pop up notifications with snooze options (15m, 1H, 3H). The non pop up notifications are way too passive.",
"Holy SPAM Batman! Any productivity gains were offset by a tremendous amount 
of email from Todoist about upcoming, past, and deleted deadlines. Didn't 
save me any time.",
Really I just disliked it because it told me how many karma points I have but I'm a Christian....I don't want karma points and I don't believe in them.,
"Cant even set a reminder in the free version. Appalling that a to-do app 
charges a subscription fee as if they provide a service equal to something 
like Netflix. Ridiculous.",
"Minimalism gone to seed After wandering around for a few minutes, you'll eventually figure out that to actually DO anything with this clickbait you'll have to subscribe to the tune of $28 per year, and that's AFTER you download the instructions from Kindle.  Uninstalling this in favor of a spreadsheet=dodging a bullet.",
I love this app the only thing I wish you could do would be a short cut to add something to a parent task? There might already be a way to do it I just haven't found it yet. By far the best to do list app I've ever used!,
This app is great so far. It's helping keep me organized and I'm actually getting things done!,
When I log in it shows my credentials as incorrect whereas they're not. And it doesn't let me sign up either,
"Doesn't let you view or recover completed tasks unless you pay - and often, lag will make all of your tasks ""complete"" at once.",
"It helps me to organize my work. It will be good if todoist include task priority like urgent, important priority",
Link with Google and it's perfect. ... not liking the fact that I need to put things both in my to do and my calendar.  But I like to program to much to search for another and start over,
The UI is nice but requires a yearly subscription to get notifications... worthless list if it's not going to remind me.,
"Again another app that is fantastic except it has sorts of restrictions if you don't get an upgrade (purchase full version). Really looking for something quick, easy, simple, efficient and free.",
The application is really full of empowering options...  Sometimes it sync wrong but compared to any other application it's perfect,
Most basic feature of getting notifications requires you to pay. There are other apps which has this feature free. Not recommending Todoist.,
"Overall the app is great, but one thing I hate is that they charge you for reminder, which is a free feature in most to-do app.",
Love this app but desperately wish I could alter font size on the widget.,
1 they don't have routine tasks 2. They  sending spam right away. 3 they removed app from my main window,
It's great in functionality and adapts to any workflow. Just wish the UI feels less like an excel spreadsheet and has more engaging colourful UI elements.,
Setting Reminder is something very basic and keeping it for premium version is not good.,
Cool but I'm not buying the upgraded version just to get daily reminders that's crazy,
Also has such an awkward method of setting up recurring tasks.,
Too many basic features that require a premium subscription. There are other apps out there that offer more at a lower cost...,
"the features that are most needed on a mobile are all Premium-only. Installed and immediately uninstalled due to immense disappointment. I'll stick with Astrid, thank you.",
Todoist is my favorite organizational app. I love the tracking of productivity and the fact that I can go from my phone or computer no matter where I am so I always have access to my lists.,
"A useful app, especially due to the ability to prioritise tasks. My only criticism would be that too much of it is for premium users only.",
I've tried loads and was already using this in chrome. So now I have the best of both.,
Hi please please enable seeing completed tasks properly.  This can manage everything except habits steals which I would love to use with karma points.,
This is the most useful task manager I have yet to use. Key is the multi platforms it serves. Finally a system that can work for my different work areas.,
I installed it because this was integrated with Google Home. The basic functionality works great but I would like more options available like Next Week tasks except just Today's tasks.,
I do not want to share my todo lists with you. Please make the app available offline too.,
"No Reminders in free version? Really?  And $30 a year for reminders and some other functionality. I'd certainly pay $3.99, even $4.99 one time for premium since it is a nice looking app, available on any platform, etc. Wondering how all the 5-star raters are getting reminded of their task deadlines?",
Don't like the fact that I have to pay for simple reminders or other tasks that are free with other companies. Love everything elsw,
Its not possible to work comfortable with any serious volumes of subtasks. All another features are good on first view.,
I downloaded it because I wanted to try some new to-do manager but when a wanted to add new task and I see that reminders are at paid version I uninstalled it immediatelly. 30$ for year only for reminders. I use Any. Do and there are paid only reminders with extra features.,
This has its own way of doing things a takes a little getting used to but over all it is a good app.,
I've tried logging in 3 times already it is too slow or its not working. Uninstall.,
"Helps me keep track of all my assignments for school and helps me steady ahead. Just wish every aspect was free but, I understand why it can't be.",
"The best checklist I tried. Got hierarchy, repeatable tasks, it looks quite well AND got a web app, 100% recommended.",
"Still wish it had additional functionality, such as start dates in addition to due dates, but easily better than all alternatives for personal task management.",
"This application feels (and probably is) light but powerful enough for my daily use. It looks nice as well, which works as a great motivation to use it.",
So many options are premium only. That's disgraceful. Overall it's good and it sucks that premium is that costly,
"If you upgrade, you get the option to use notes and labels. Free version not good",
Making labels is a premium feature while it's a really important one for making lists organized. So the free package is messy indeed!,
"Well designed sure, but most of the important functions are behind a pay wall. Which would be fine if it was a one time payment, not a yearly subscription.",
Only gripe is it doesn't do outlining better. I would have given it 5 ✨ otherwise.,
Would be 5 stars if it had the following: 1) A way to set the default due date for new tasks 2) A widget for badge app icons to show number of tasks due that day without opening the app,
"Loved it, past tense.  Sneak update totally changed the whole look and usefulness. Just uninstalled it. Is now total garbage. Good job, Todoist elves.",
absolute garbage. why the heck do I need fb to use the app.   your app your rules right.   my choice  and that of many like me see that as bs.,
Love it. Keeps me focused when my mind strays. Which is often. It makes me smile. Good working times.,
"Awesome! If you are busy person with multiple projects, maybe even with a team, this app is for you. Makes your life more functional, productive and organized. GTD setup is needed to accomplish all this but todoist has such a good community. You find tons of video and blog material about Yodoist and GTD setups.",
Still working on learning all the features. Have been using it for a few weeks now. Like it so far. Especially the reschedule feature,
Not able to add daily routine tasks. No from and to time,
This has really helped me to get things done. BUT The back button exits the app far too often which is very irritating. Please fix for 5 stars ✨,
"I love this service and the features it has.  I also really like this app.  The design is great,  and follows Google's design guidelines very well. I use this along with the Chrome extension so my task list everywhere I go.  This service and app have recently added file attachments with cloud storage integration. That made awesome even more awesome.",
"Google should make an app like this, it's Calendar app is not intuitive like this, giving this app low partly becuz of no integration",
The email reminder with pending works is an awesome feature that I like...,
"At least provide just basic push notifications for my tasks. I understand that it is a premium feature but what is the point of an app when it does not remind you of your tasks. Please make it a free feature because that is the basics that is needed. For now, uninstalled.",
I don't want another app that forces me to sign up or log in or integrates with social media. I want a simple to-do list app that I can open up and use immediately. Todoist is not that app.,
"Very good app, just have to improve the way to ad recurring task. Isn't friendly to ad set a task to repeat per day/time.",
"It helps you plan your days, and see what are the urgent and important tasks",
I like the ability to drag items up the list to reorder priority.,
the price is a joke bad app you can't do much unless you pay up the butt to make do anything,
When i uninstalled the app its still in my phone it also wasted my battery by 5% when it showed a notification but again i uninstalled it so please dont install,
I've had more marketing emails from them in one day than reminders that I have tasks.  Very poor experience,
"When I try to enter with Google, I see ""the Google token is invalid or outdated"".",
Free version will not even let you set reminders.  Task list will.  App size seems bloated.,
I like this app and use it everyday. But i need one more feature in it - I should be abe to add todays tasks on same day with time. Suppose i have to attend some meeting today at 5 pm which is scheduled now ( at 11am) then currently there is no option for adding same. Pls add it. Great app altogether.,
Interesting looking app but there is no way I'd pay $29 for Premium when Google offers to-do lists out of the box for free. App uninstalled.,
"It's a great and I have been using it for some years now. I simply love it. However I have a query for the developer. Lately, it has started hanging or not responding mostly during offline mode. I urge for a fitting reply so that I can continue using it without having to uninstall and reinstall several times a month",
Best todo app ever. It has labels to categorize different things and you can specify different times to achieve a task,
"Widget is cool way to have an overview. The interface is fast and responsive. Overall, this app makes me really productive. I wish the label is also free.",
"Great app with a lot of versatility. Easy to enter tasks, easy to view what you want. Really nice to be able to make a task quickly from an e-mail, with a link to the original e-mail.",
Requires you to make a new account or to link an existing Google account. I just want a simple todo list that won't track me or invade my privacy,
I've tried probably 100 different task management applications over the past 15 years or so and Todoist is the clear winner.  Premium user and happy.,
"Because the value I get out of Todoist allows me to be more productive than I have been before. So simple, intuitive.  I am confident that the money I pay will allow the service to continue many years into the future. The app itself is 4 stars, because it needs a bit more polish.",
"Free version very limited, no reminders so not very useful. Pro version appears to be more useful but at $29.95 / year, fugetta bout it!",
Its a great app I recommend but their premium option pricing is ridiculous.,
"Great app, but I think the pro version is way too expensive as a subscription, so I'm going to look for a cheaper alternative.",
"Used it for a couple of days before I realised there is no reminder alarm on a free version. I am a very busy andforgetful person, so without reminders this app is useless to me. Would give 4-5 stars if that feature was free.",
"Personally i like ""any.do"" better. (Will automatically ask me if I want to set a reminder to return the call. For a distracted person such as i, very useful).",
Don't get me wrong its good but I'm just confused😆😆,
"UI looks great, but I won't use it until there is support for multiple Google accounts, unless there already is and I just can't figure it out.",
"It did not sync properly, nor promptly. It is cumbersome to add tasks, and see the history. Not worth the time to learn to operate one more application when a plethora of similar tools are readily available.",
"The app itself works well, I suppose, but with important features like reminders only available if you upgrade to the paid service, I've decided to uninstall and go with another similar app that's free.",
"Really awesome app. Changed my way of planning my life and, at the same time, adapted excellently to my lifestyle.",
Using this app to follow the GTD approach to task management. Seems to work very well for me!,
Performance wise: Great. The only gripe is the UX if you don't like lists and prefer post it notes.,
But too basic and $29/year for something I can do for free is a little steep but you pay for all-in-one usability.,
Way too many features are only available as premium upgrade. My phone's basic task manager has more features than the base option.  Waste of my time.,
"Very nice program, I love that it syncs easily with your Todoist account on your computer. App isn't always intuitive and some of the nice organization features that I love on the computer are a bit cumbersome on the app.",
I uninstalled as soon as I saw the feature missing :(. I went back to Google Keep app,
"Amazing, whilst I may not get everything done it has made me a hell of a lot more productive. Great app!",
The key for me with GTD is having a single inbox to manage from and a single place to integrate all your plans and next steps. I've achieved all of this with this tool because of its simplicity and integration across my ecosystem.,
"I would like to be able to create tasks that repeat daily, weekly etc. I didn't see that option. Makes it worthless to me. Could just as easily make a text to do list. App not required.",
I need to be able to see all my tasks immediately rather than switching between inbox and projects. Such an obvious feature but for some reason it hasn't been added,
You'll need to pay the subscription fee to get recurring reminders.  I'm uninstalling.,
Why can't we just try out the program before being forced to sign up / join etc.,
"Seems like a perfectly useful piece of software, but there is absolutely no way I'm going to pay a subscription fee to use this kind of software. It's not even worth a one time fee of $30,  let alone yearly.",
"I am new to Todoist and was not devoted to the old interface,but I do like the new one. So many integrations make this my favorite task application, and I have tried many.",
Can't set reminders without subscribing to its yearly plan which is too costly considering free apps like Any.do.,
Basic function such as reminder can only be used by premium service. They operate a subscription model instead of one off payment.,
Beautiful design but I wasted too much time trying to work with the free version. I had to create the task then set the time. An app like this is supposed to help us prioritize and save time not waste it,
"Todoist is not only great design and functionality, but it's being improved and maintained continually. I'm really glad a friend recommended it!",
Limited features in free version. Alerts are not made properly. Premium version is expensive. UI is good and easy to use. Cheklist feature is missing in free version.,
Use it with chrome on my PC but was not able to add events and was much more difficult to use with Android.,
It does what its supposed to but if you uninstall it they keep sending you emails which annoys me.,
Actually learned more from the app than from the website. Still not a fan but required to use.,
It's good but some option missing in app like- -1. completed task list 2. Task calendar view 3. Picture or music insert in a task,
"Great GUI and layout. Sharing is easy, and the widget is fantastic. It makes collaboration much more efficient.",
"Super useful. I purchased the pro subscription, it's awesome that i can look at it on my phone and on outlook on desktop! Wish it integrated into my calendar, though.",
"I think this app is not oriented towards individuals, but large working groups instead. Although the app has good aesthetics, its free tools and options come short vs other apps' (like TickTick, AnyDo or even Google Keep).",
"This app saves my life everyday. I have no brain when it comes to task management, so the ""nagging"" I can set up in this app is awesomeness. Believe me, I've tried just about every app in the play store, this is the one you want!",
"Great app, love the look.   Way overpriced,  give us a pro version,  one time pay.",
I'm not paying for an entire years subscription for something I very likely won't use for a full year.  I'm just not quite that busy. And you have  to upgrade to use alerts. No thank you.,
"Nice iterface, but you have to pay $30/yr if you want push notifications. There's no Google Task sync.",
"I don't realize how valuable the premium version is, until I give it try. Keep me on track. Well worth the 29 USD per year!",
Everything I wanted to do was only available in the paid version. I would have preferred a time limited version so that I could assess whether it was worth paying for,
"Decided to try premium for a lil while, didnt like it and cancel it but still didn't receive refund acknowledgement. Not a good app to try full features.",
"Looking for a replacement for my current to do list app and widget, but this isn't it. No option to make the task recurring, at least not that I could easily find within the app.",
App stopped working has to uninstall but now wont install shame it was a good app. Cant unsubscribe from emails,
"The app itself was great but if you want to ""label"" anything you have to upload to premium and I work on a very color coded system",
I am a person who likes a full schedule and to always be going.   I unfortunately have a hard time remembering all my todos.   Tourist saves my life.   It enables me to be successful yet fast paced.   I love it.   It's part of my life.,
If the first step to any app _requires_ an account then it's a waste of my time because functionality shouldn't require a login.,
"Don't even try it, I did by mistake and got a support email but nothing on the email had the unsubscribe link.",
"I am a premium customer and this is the best Todoist app I've used. Now if they allow the ability to add items to subtasks in the app, it would be perfect.",
Useful. Just a little complicated to understand how it works. And problems with the autosync with the online platform and the app.,
I un subscribed two times and they keep sending me emails to try the premium version.,
"Deleted mine as had to pay $44,95 just to have a reminder. Other reminder calender apps are free. Looks like a great idea though if it was cheaper",
deleting completed task is very tiresome process. don't have option to delete multiple completed to do list.,
Reminders cost money. No thank you! What's the point without reminders. Seems like a good set up but I'm going to look elsewhere.,
I've been using this for a year now. I normally don't write reviews because I'm lazy but this application is simply awesome!,
"I'm using Todoist on my Galaxy A3 and Windows 10 Pc. While I still find myself compromising on functionality I'd like to access, I cannot justify paying that amout for a premium subscription.",
"Mobile should have all the features of desktop app. Will change my review to 5 stars when we get this. In the meantime, I'll be using TickTick",
On adding my first reminder I needed to upgrade to Premium to use all the features. Uninstalled after 30 seconds.,
"Requires sign up. Unacceptable for me. I want to keep my tasks private or 
share some through my own server.",
It has all the features and simple to use. I would have given a 5 star if there was a reminder of every task in the free version,
"Too complicated for my needs, also suspect in sudden jump in data useage.",
Easily the best to-do list I've come across. Cross-platform functionality is great and the annual price to unlock all features isn't too bad if you intend to rely heavily on Todoist. Excellent widget too - possibly the best feature.,
I like this app though I am still working through it. I am finding the nesting of tasks not as robust in the free app.,
I liked this app good enough. I only used the free version which was as it was described by the creator and the users. my boss decided his reports needed something else so that is why I am using something else. if I needed a list app for personal or my own business I would use this app again.,
"I depend on Todoist - it's an always open tab on my browser and I use it just as much  on my Android phone and iPad. I have multiple projects going, color coded, with sub-projects for different clients. The best task organizer I've tried.",
I like it since the first day I downloaded  it because it's really very useful for me when I'm at work. You should try it and I'm sure you will like it too. No harm to try isn't it. :-),
"Hi, to all who want to organise  their daily tasks  then use this app. I love android  app. Also purchased  pro version.",
"App looks like it's alright but you have to buy the premium to get reminders... What's the point of a to do list without reminders, especially when there's tons of to do apps with reminders at no extra cost?",
I have multiple emails and projects. I do not want to have to sign in and tie an email to it.,
"Handiest! I feel like a pen and paper instantly ready to hand. Simplest, easiest and most comprehensive. Fantastic look of interface and brilliant sync :)",
"Had this a couple of weeks to replace a previous app.  Really like liked it,  got up one morning and it's totally changed.  No more simple adding tasks and looks more complicated than Gmail!  Will be looking for an alternative to this.  Please change it back!!!!!",
"All the main features are in premium. Nothing good in free version, even the reminders are not available in free version.",
"I love the integration with Google assistant. It also has a very good widget, where you can switch between your lists.  Unfortunately the free version does not have notifications (apart from a daily overview) which makes it unusable for me.",
So many features... works across platforms and has an intuitive simple productivity method better than others I have tried. Worth trying it out.,
"This is a great todo list management app.  Easy to use with lots of features for organizing, categorizing, labeling, and searching.  Also integrates well with other apps.  Excellent.",
Something about the app could still be improved though I'm not sure exactly how.,
It's not as good as Wunderlist. It seems that all the 'cool' and usefull features are only available in the upgraded version.,
There is a limit of 200 tasks per list. Is this some kind of joke. No it is not. Deleted.,
Useless for collaborating with others like it said I could.,
First used it to plan a major holiday. Excellent. It nags a bit which is why the holiday went without any hitches.,
I couldn't do anything I wanted to do without paying for premium. That's ridiculous to me. I'm not paying for something like this.,
"I have tried many different todo-lists, but none is as user friendly as Todoist",
Everything I tried to do other than an extreme narrow basic function it said you needed to upgrade for.,
Its so expensive to upgrade to premium. I could find apps just like this one for less money.,
Had to figure out a bit how to navigate the app but its great once I figured it out!,
No real integration with gmail.  I wanted an app that can work with gmail emails and create tasks from that,
I love love love this app! I use it for so many things from work to home and being able to access from the phone or Web makes it a great tool. Using it for my grocery list is the best!,
I am not motivated to anything using this app.! Its just a simple to do list with an alarm that's it,
"This is a clean app but the lack of a list of active actions (that is, a list of next steps that can be taken next in each project) limits it for me.",
But the app is gorgeous,
It works without problems across desktop laptop tablet and phone which makes keeping current with projects and taskI ams very easy. At last! Definitely worth buying the pro version.  Very nice to use. Thank you.,
You can't do anything on this app without a yearly subscription for $30 which is absurdly high! I host my own server for $10 on Digital Ocean.,
"I only tried the free version but I find this app too restrictive when 
there are other ""to do"" apps that do more and are free such as adding notes 
to tasks or throwing a reminder notification in. The paid version is 
probably fantastic but for a uni student who is usually already strap for 
cash I wouldn't recommend when you can get better free alternatives.",
I love simplicity but the interface could certainly use a revamp..  Looks too old school. However the functionality is great!,
"So boring. I just scheduled 1 day. It sends me email everyday, and it's hard to find how to turn it off. Even if I deleted this task, it still sent me one mail which told me I had finished it. Really ridiculous and bad experience.",
Does everything I need it to do. I create to do lists and set alerts. Gives nice reminders when I don't complete tasks on time.,
"I would have even subscribed to this app. BUT I can't save it on external SD card, SO I had to deinstall it.",
"Todoist is as close to perfection as apps come.  The app is simple, fast and reliable.  The task flow is well designed to handle quick chores, long term tasks, shopping lists, and other use cases.  When paired with the chrome plugin and Google calendar integration, you always have your tasks when you need them.  This app has helped me organize my various task managers into one place.",
"Am really enjoying the scaffolding of organizational support offerred by ToDoist! A bit of a learning curve,  but it's really helping me with executive function challenges!",
"Really enjoying Todoist. Great to use, from simple shopping lists to more 
complex career plans! Ease of use and also love the suggested 
auto-reschedule of due date feature. I have also looked a lot into the 
company and enjoy their vision. Overall - a big fan!",
"Even reminders are available only in premium! This is a basic function, you can't even call the app ""todo list"" if it deprived of this function. That's outrageously.",
"An alert reminder is a pretty basic feature. I don't find alerts and labels to be worth $30/year. Nice looking app, though. I might have otherwise liked this.",
This has quickly become my favorite to do app. It's got a beautiful interface and it's feature packed. Works very well.  Highly recommended.,
Should not be requesting access to personal info like identity and pictures.,
Gone are the days where I sit down from a meeting and blankly stare at the screen not knowing what to do! This app is great for organizing and prioritizing your tasks.,
"It is more difficult to manage projects because i have to scroll down to tap ""+"" or ""manage projects"". Deleting projects requires more effort. No easy access to ""everyday"" deadline. Do not fix what is not broken.",
"If you use the free version, the annoying premium features are still visible. If you upgrade to the paid version, it's not enough to buy it once. They make you pay again and again...every year!",
"Haven't got the app but keeps spamming my gmail every single day with E mails... I dont really know why that's happening, please make something about it",
...since the last major update. App is still functional but now takes 45 secs to do what used to take 10 secs. Not too crazy about the new minimal skin also.,
"When I put in my tasks it keep me in check by giving me a notifications 
that I have stuff that needs to get done!love this app and would definitely 
recommend this app!!!",
"It's awesome. It'd have been more perfect had there been an option to select Sub-Task. If it's possible, then please upgrade it to have sub-tasks",
Wants me to log in before it will do anything. No thank you.,
The GPS remind future is only good for 1 block.  Would be so much more useful to be able to increase reminder distance,
"This app is beautifully designed and seems amazing. Unfortunately it costs too much. I would pay a flat fee, but not monthly.",
All the features that really help you achieve your goal have to be purchase with the upgrade... so its not really free.,
My review was changed. This app requires account creation to use. Uninstalled immediately.,
Don't waste your time. Features limited in free version. You can't tell if purchase is wanted.,
Reminder is premium feature! That makes free version useless.,
Love this app! I use it for my mutiple businesses and personal tasks. I don't know what I'd do without it.,
The application is so good but it need to be more user friendly for example the due date it's better to open a calendar and select the day besides writing the day. But thanks for make this application!,
"""Reminders are a premium feature"". Basic functionality free version.  If the app were 5 or 10 bucks I might buy it... But they want 30 dollars per year for the privilege of having their app.  Pass.",
"support for iOS, Android, and Windows are what make this app unique.  I also like the ability to organize tasks the way I choose, add comments, add photos, set reminders, etc...a great app!",
"Useful app to use in my daily life.  Keeps me organized, and the widget is a big plus too so I can keep it on my home screen.  Great app, even free.",
"This is a joke, pure & simple.  Will not set up an account, & useless without one.",
Five star if you can include attachment & done history or at least trash.,
It's horrible to use. No useable  calender feature for scheduling,
Was looking for a todo list. Got an app that sends me 8 emails a day. I deleted app and unsubscribed to no avail. Still spamming me. Regret. Definitely regret.,
Not interested because I have to create an account just to try it.,
Gotta be kidding me! I don't mind paying premium but not for adding notes to a task. No way. This feature is free on every one of the 100+ ToDo apps in Play. Other things should be charged for.,
Alert! this app is extremely spammy and wont let you unsubscribe.,
Reminder unavailable in free version. Useless. Plus sends unwanted emails.,
MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE-REMINDERS-IS OPEN FOR PREMIUM USERS ONLY- SHAME,
Setting reminders is a premium feature. Not even useful to test it out without that.,
"It understands me very much, but perfection isn't achievable :)",
"One star rating for spamming my email AFTER I deinstalled app, unsubscribed, and also for missing UNSUBSCRIBE link in your e-mails!",
"Every time you look at the beauty of well designed colourful butterflies, then never think of this APP. More akin to flies that have a cleaning job to do and Todoist would be first on  their list cleaning it up! Refund me please!",
This isn't gonna help me to remind myself to bring my lunch money,
This is definitely one of the most thought I'd well-planned calendar and organizer all-in-one that I have found.  Great Job,
"The new update has mistakes, please fix it!",
Yet another to do app that doesn't integrate with Exchange.,
The app doesn't connect to my laptop automatically.,
This is a gimmick.  Thirty dollars a year to add a label.  Give me a break. Maybe if they weren't greedy it would be worth it.,
Too expensive for me. TickTick does the same for much less.,
Perfect app. Can't get better. No bugs what do ever,
"Clean design, super responsive and the syncing across other platforms is amazing.",
"Todoist makes my day more active, i finish my scheduled task and every time 
I mark my task I really feel happy for that accomplishment I had",
You get the very basic for free..you have to upgrade and pay just to use the reminder feature!  Un installed this one and found a new one with more features for free!,
"They say they are giving a 30 day free trial of there premium account but of course it doesn't work it tries to charge you, it would have got 0 stars if possible",
"Got hooked, now it's like my gcal, totally dependent. No problems with sync or usage.",
"Cannot add notes,  change settings,  or do anything useful",
"I find that the application is more persistent than I am, and that is a good thing.",
"Until I will subscribe for the Premium version, I can say that Todoist is really good for sloppy, short-term memory people like myself.",
"User-friendly, intuitive design. Karma is the perfect carrot to keep me on task. 😃",
Google Keep or Tasks are free and sync better.,
A task app with depth and large amounts of customization. As simple or complex as you want it to be.,
Look it a a nice app but you have to spend to get the basics like Reminders. No Thanks.,
"Very good task manager,  reminds me of quality windows enterprise apps but this one is available for all platforms and tasks are kept in the cloud!",
Missing very basic features like user rights management. Rest it's beautifully designed with simple to use .,
"Love the reminders and alerts, I would like it more if the task completed would be highlighted somewhere to see all of your accomplishments",
"My buddy told me to check this out.  A big thing I rely on is being reminded of a task. A basic feature, but you have to pay for it.  If it was one time, I'd probably go for it, but annually? No thanks",
Even basic features like reminder for task is not available in free version. Don't waste time in installing & exploring this app.,
The API enables better integration with my workflow and apps and the ability to read long task names because the boxes are not fixed height is a big value.,
Can't use notifications unless you upgrade.  Useless.,
"Great app, would love calendar integration though, wonder why such an important feature was not added.",
Not intuitive at all. Can't understand why it is so highly rated.,
Notes requires premium SUBSCRIPTION so not for me.  The syncing and collaboration sounds great.,
Any to do list app is crap if it doesn't have recurrence option,
Notifies in goir inbox which is stupid to clean up and even notice,
Keyboard stopped functioning properly after last update. Uninstalled this app.,
"even after uninstalling still sending email notifications, and you couldn't turn them off when it was installed",
Uninstalled right away cause very hard to use. Not user friendly at all.,
Really sleek app but I am not paying $20 a year for really simple features that should come with a free version (or a cheaper one). Uninstalled.,
You only get notifications after you go premium,
I am not willing to pay an expensive  upgrade just for a to do list,
Looks promising will rate in full when it downloads as has frozen,
"Todoist really know how to turn a simple concept to be their advantage. Like the karma and daily streak concept, I like it. Just a simple difference but it give me some kind of incentive mechanism as a feedback for finishing the tasks.  Nice...",
"$28 per year is a bit steep. Can't add notes or details to a task until you subscribe. Created category: shopping, but couldn't make a list in that category. Might be a good app, but it's unusable before paying.",
I installed it. Realized it doesn't sync with Google Calendar. This is a deal breaker. Uninstalled it and switched to GTasks instead. App would be great if it synced. :-(,
Full app is subscription based. Just let me pay the money once and let me have the thing you greedy jerks!,
One of the best apps I've used. Really helpful with task tracking and productivity management.,
There was no option to repeat tasks.  Deal breaker for me but otherwise seemed like a fine app.,
I love Todoist and the mobile app just extends the functionality as you'd hope for.,
This app has become part of my everyday. It is lightweight has a lot of functionality and seems very reliable.,
"Awesome app, not perfect but the best thing out there =)",
"Don't want to create an account, don't want to sync, and definitely not collaborate with friends. Was I offered a choice? Nope... Hope you make,a paranoid-friendly version",
Very bad don't download it..asks for upgrades now and then,
Wanted to access this on my smart watch but requires a steep annual fee to utilize this service. Uninstalled,
"Personalized labels, and even reminders have to be done on the premium version. I'll pass",
I think we should be able to see the tasks of the past. That way we can track our progress.,
This app helps me stay on track of my goal and control my life!,
App looks really nice but it's not all free,
Seriously the app is great But you need to pay $35.00 just for basic functions such as reminders for tasks and adding notes. There are many many other similar apps that are free or cost only of the price of this one. TRY ANOTHER APP INSTEAD.,
The first three buttons I pressed to explore the app were all upgrade ads.  Uninstalled immediately.,
This keeps me ahead of worrying about missed duties. I rest better.,
It costs 28.99 per year if you want reminders.  Not very useful without them. Better free apps out there.,
Seriously! I have to pay for the notification ! It's a common feature. It shouldn't have a price tag.,
Chouette app mais vite desinstallée a cause de la limitation d'une sync par jour.. pas envie de payer 3$ par mois pour une todolist! !,
"This application be like hi u need premium version for reminders what a 
waste of space application",
Very poor compared to anydo or trello.  Pay pay pay premium.  I would if it is good enough,
No Reminder Functionality + Automatically Added to Company Email Marketing = Quick Uninstall for Me,
Can only add new tasks from a Wear device. I was hoping for a way to work with my shopping list from my watch.,
"It's a good app.  I can't justify £21.99 for any app, let alone for only one year access to an app.",
"Cool app with nice interface. Would be nice to quicker add task, and take that extra second opening app to write the new task.",
"Every time I tried to add a project or task, the app would force-close (Galaxy nexus, 4.1 jellybean). the task/project was there when I restarted the app.  If you want the premium features, the premium upgrade fee is expensive and is a recurring monthly (or annual fee). I just don't see enough value from the app to make it worth $28/year or more.",
Please add the option to switch to a normal theme. It's hard to use it like this.,
Really handy todo app! I've been using it like crazy.,
Great connection within my email. THE best way to stay on top of tasks and emails!,
What is the point of opening if there is no pop up..or notification,
Can't do anything without paying an outrageous amount for the premium version! Hard to know if it's worth more stars without at least being able to have access to a free trial.,
"Any chance for Push notification icon color showing as theme color, instead of Red?  I consistently have Gmail notifications that have yet to be ""taken care of"" sitting there. Red Gmail icon and text is very similar to the red Todoist push. UX would be greatly improved (imo).  I'll change to 5 stars even for a canned Reply... :)",
"This is the one. I tried several before settling on Todoist. Chrome widget, great Android apps and the ability to prioritize, have projects with sub tasks and due dates... All for free? Just wow. Love it.",
"This is definitely a well thought out app. But, as others have noted, the premium price isn't worth it. If it was a one time charge, it still be tough to swallow given that there are some excellent alternatives out there, far cheaper in price.",
Doesn't update tasks and widget doesn't work well. Started great but lost functionality as time passed.,
Was loving it.  Not loving the update. Adding a task is no where near as simple and effective as it was,
If you can get a calender feature like in digical that would be awesome. Make it a complete app.,
"It asks you to upgrade to get any good features, without upgrade its just a normal app",
"one of the worst to do list, even a simple of filter and it fail",
Is not all that there is batter apps out there,
Very helpful. Easy to use but powerful enough to manage my daily tasks.,
"Seemed to be a great app, but limited in use unless you buy the full app for $29 a year. Nope.",
Had helped me stay focused for work and personal projects,
"Love how functional and versatile Todoist is! It's incredibly helpful in organizing my tasks by project, priority, date, etc. I've used it for more than two years already and will continue to do so!",
It is the best tool that keep me to achieve many things in one day.,
Probably the best task management system I ever saw. Changed the way I live. Just hope to keep using it!,
tried multiple before this one. Great as stand alone todo list but love that task lists can be shared,
Have tried many and found this the most effective. Thanks to the developers. You understand our needs.,
Had to uninstall because I couldn't print from my tablet. Seemed to be very comprehensive,
This app is for sick nerd ballers who want to get stuff done,
"They collected contact info from my system.  First, came the spam emails ...",
Would have been perfect if recurring tasks feature was included.,
Made many tasks in my life easier .,
"Free version is really simple,reminder not included. Disgusting!!",
Love this app. Glad I came across it.,
Reminders are a premium feature? Garbage. Complete garbage. I can't believe they have the nerve to call this scam a free app.,
"Great app, it's a shame that many essential features for a Task app are available only for premium users",
realy enjiyed the app cuz of its simplicity and usefullness .,
Overall interface is filled with lot of features - minor UI issues while collapsing and expanding tasks seem to have been fixed,
"very functional, would love to be able to connect it to my Google calendar to add things like events and reminders and things that are optional",
So far so good. To-do nicely managed. Reminder are good. Tried other apps and found this best.,
Not at all useful,
"All features in the paid version, free version suck.. Even reminder which is the simplest feature in any task app...",
"Easy to use, keeps my mind clear for other important things I need to think about",
Doesnt say anywhere in the market that requires sign up acount,
"The moment I saw that the basic functionality of creating reminders is a premium feature, you lost me as a user.",
"Reminders should be a basic feature of a to do app, not a premium purchase. The app looks good, but I switched to another one that offers reminders for free.",
Great tool to mange tasks. But in the world of task management I need a tool to solve the workflows and mange them.,
"I'm sorry, but a premium subscription to have reminders in a to do app? I understand the need for a paid model, but reminders seems like a pretty basic function that should not be locked behind a pay wall.",
"Awesome, i have it in my computer and cellphone and it works just perfect, it's very easy to use.",
I swear I was about making similar app.. But then I found this.. Damit 😂,
I'm giving it one more chance. Just because I've got no better option.,
"Yeaaah, not creating ANOTHER account for a to-do app.",
"I love this app! It is so simple to use, the layout of everything is so organised, I love it! I also like how the app displays your tasks for a week just like a scheduling diary. I do have one request though. Could the developers add more vibrant colours for the icon colours please?",
My net connection is totally fine. But this aap!!! Not even able to download it,
"Todoist help me to boost my productivity also their blog posts really helpful to use it effectively. By the way, I'm your premium member. Worth it!",
The app provides good basic task functions but one of the most basic for any task is to be able to do it and at the right time - for which you need a reminder. Why is it premium? Uninstalled and using my phone memo pad and usual sharing apps! One and the same...,
"The website for Todoist is phenomenal and being able to view the lists on mobile is nice, though the app is far from as full featured or easy to use as the site currently. Still, I highly recommend it. I really wish the text on the widget took up less space so you can see more than a couple items at a time; I'd much rather see an overview of the list in the widget and have to open the app to check something if it means I don't have to use a full screen widget. ColorNote's widgets are perfect in this regard.",
"Ottima come app. Però potreste migliorare di più la app aggiungendo un timer focus(nel quale per esempio si pianta una foresta per motivarci) e una suddivisione delle task in argomenti più comoda. Per esempio che la si possa vedere le varie cartelle subito e in maniera veloce. Sarebbe molto carina una sezione dedicata alle abitudini, un habit tracker. E si potrebbero aggiungere anche la possibilità di vedere ancora le task completate sbarrate. Piuttosto che spariscano. Pk lo trovo più motivante",
Too many things locked behind paywall. Otherwise might consider. I'm not their target yet I guess? Just wanted to track tasks with my partner,
just tortuous. There is better and easier apps for simple to-do lists.,
This works great.  I just wish I was more disciplined to use it with some consistency,
I checked all my to do list yesterday and one today. Amazing for my ADHD mind. So happy. Try it!,
Even basic features requires subscription.. This app is not for individuals.. May be this app is for enterprises which need a task manager..,
"Awesome, been through many task mangers and I like this, simple and efficient and deep below the surface",
Best todo app i have come across. Would love to see calendar view though,
But you need the pay version for any decent functions like notes on a task.,
Easy to use. Has definitely made my life more efficient. Thank you Todoist team.,
"The free app is cool, but paid version for simply labling task? And 30 dollar a year? Come on...",
"It's streamlined and uncluttered,  yet powerful, flexable, and very eady to  use.",
I think not. Google keep is good enough for me.,
"This app is very helpful, because one day I forgot the anniversary of my parents, because of work.. I am vefy thankful to have tis app.. LOL",
"Really great cross platform app, love it use it every day and has great integrations",
Trash! Having to pay for a reminder,
"This app is the very very good task manager, but with task dependencies that would be the best and the grate for ever",
"I have tried a number of to do list apps but this is by far the best. Simple, effective, user friendly...great!",
Never sent me reminders or notifications,
"Dont install, you have to upgrade with money for everything",
They want $30 a year that's ridiculous,
"It's an amazing app, and the free features are enough to make you a power 
user.",
To much effort to stay organized with this platform.. Also it's not free. I prefer keep or OneNote.,
"Nice app but you have to pay 40$ a year to have the full premium version. This is very expensive for a ""To Do list App""",
Clean UI. I hope it has Google now integration in the future,
Confusing and a lot of functionality has to be bought,
Great work fellas!  Really nice execution.  Next stop is to add some widgets...,
"why do I HAVE TO have an account? I have some notes to make like once every two month, I'm not gonna give you my email for that.",
This app is fully useless without premier version. if you can't afford 29$ per year then don't install it !!,
"All I wanted to do was make lists, this wanted to be my secretary!",
Utter crap without reminders on the non-paid version of the app...,
If you use it daily it becomes part of your life.It will be more smoother.,
"Great app, super intuitive, and love the gamification of getting stuff done!",
"Mi piace la app però ci sono modifiche che si devono migliorare. 1 le task completat, è più motivante che non spariscano nel nulla ma che restino sbarrate. 2 analisi e statistiche sul progresso con notifiche 3 amo la opzione karma e i vari livelli, però sarebbe più utile se venissero delle notifiche a ricordarmi per esempio a che punto sono del livello. O comunque dei piccoli premi alla fine di un tot di task. Spero che aggiornate presto pk credo che abbia del potenziale questa app.",
No reminder function. Got to pay for it.,
Crashed Repeated upon installation.   Un-installed.,
You need to pay 30 dollars a year for it to be worth it but besides that it is the best to do list app ever!,
It's a reminder app and for adding a time reminder you need to pay !!!!. What nonsense,
It's a to do list app...why do i need to sign up or sign in with gmail account? At least let me try the app without signing up...I just want a basic to-do list app. I guess this app isn't for me since it is cloud based..,
"After deep testing 5 other tools, this one is the perfect one! Simple, clean and minimalistic! Worth the price !",
"Please add a reminder, everything else is great!",
I just need a reminder not another account! This is crap! I need simple reminder on my phone not an online reminder! I need it offline!,
It's a great app but I wish that having reminders would be free.,
I would give it a well-deserved 5 star ONLY if the constant mobile app crash would stop. :-(,
Does (almost) everything I need from a to do list app!,
I used to love this when I could see things that were 2 weeks out and 3 weeks out and have a running tally of projects coming up now I can only see 7 days out that doesn't help me at all,
"Amazing app! Don't know if it's open source, but still love it!",
"It's like a virus.  Once it's installed, there's no way (that I can find to delete it, TURN OFF notifications and other things).  It has no icon (that did not install when I installed it).  I HATE IT.",
Too much for premium! Otherwise great,
I would have give 5 stars if premium options are available for free :),
"clean, uselful, and the points system is motivating!   I do wish I could see finished tasks though, that's important, with strikethrough, along with to-dos. that would seem rewarding! but on the whole its fine.",
The interface is stunning but why do I have to go premium to see my completed tasks !!,
"Виджет, спустя некоторое время, перестает работать.",
"Finally an app that thinks like I do!!  I had to go pro to really enjoy the full gamma of greatness provided, however, it would be great if it could be used with multiple email addresses.",
"Free features too limited, other features too expensive.",
Had to uninstall and down load another app 😂,
couldn't log in using my Google account.. just crashed every time... meh ill stick with my current note app instead... 1star until it's fixed,
Very limited options for adding a reminder.,
Intuitive enough for beginners.  Excellent for experienced task managers.  Very flexible.  Great search capabilities.,
This app has actively made me consistently more productive,
Too expensive - free doesn't do the task,
"I've tried them all, and this one's the best. Hands down. I love how it integrates with my Gmail.",
"See no use in paying for services I get for free on other apps. I need reminders and notifications. Cross platform is not relevant, I need an app on my phone which is with me all the time. Uninstalled.",
"tres utile, elle me facilite la vie !",
Very good for single tasks but would be nice to have weekly repeating ones,
Can't set reminders in non-pro version.,
Totally spy on your phone. Don't download!,
"It has all these features but damn isn't it quite pricy for a simple todo app? I mean come on, there isn't much what other apps can't do...",
30 dollars a year,
I'm not sure how I ever functioned without this.,
"No reminders without premium? Really? And you claim to ""achieve more"" by using it? Sorry, not sorry.",
Don't like that the free version doesn't have reminders.,
What I like about TD is that it keeps you on tasks with reminders and easy to maintain the assignment's.,
The ability to set Reminders require upgrading to Premium version - sneaky!,
I've tried them all.,
"Clean, user friendly and easy to use. Incredibly helpful, especially as an adult with ADD",
it doesn't show up in my notifications anymore!,
I've never been so productive.,
I'll get my priority and important stuff done  awesome!,
The best task managing app I've used so far!,
"1 звезда только за платную систему подписки, платить такие деньги за таск трекер это неадекватно",
This app helps me stay motivated and on top of my coursework.,
I would love a dark mode though. White text on a black background.,
"Best task management app, due to its functionality and simplicity.",
This app is a joke. Everything is a premium feature. Don't waste your time. Why no ad version?,
"Easy to use, clean interface, but with everything you need.",
Should be nice if app have start AND end date/time.,
Works great for all my work to keep on track with family and friends!,
"Great, simple app that keeps me on task.",
It's very great app for the student like me. Kudos to the team.,
Can't use nfc to share with some one,
Todoist,
I use for 2 months and this so helpfull. Big Thanks to developer.,
"Slick UI, but could do with a UX review.",
"Reconsider the price for premium function. Product is absolutely fantastic.	Reconsider the price for premium function. Product is absolutely fantastic. Want to buy, but not at this rate",
"Nice app working well ,but still need more options .",
This app suck need pro version for reminder other reminder app better than this app and give free features,
Amazing app. I hope alarm feature will be added,
Just started but I'm excited.  I've tried many. Most encouraged by this one.,
The orange font is not a clean look. Why cant I edit it to something more bold?,
Can't set reminder for free,
Moved from zenday. Integration with calendar and events would be awesome,
By far the best Todo app out there. Wins hands down.,
I started using this software so does started loving it...,
Enjoy using this app. Really helps with daily planning.,
"Even without the premium, this app is fantastic!",
I use this along with my Evernote. It works great.,
I like it. I just don't see myself using it.,
Its very good app in general life and tim managment.,
"Good, but limited functionality for my watch",
Please release tags and reminders for free accounts. Thanks,
This is what I use to make sure I complete my daily tasks. Love it,
This app is amazing app thank you.  I little update on reminders please thank you.,
I love ir. I can keep track of everything I need to do,
"Best app ever see, It makes your productivity towards awesome.",
It's a great app but there are better alternatives like Habitica.,
I don't want to log in!!! I don't want to use it anywhere else! Still 1 star because I hate being asked to create an account...,
Fantastic app.. easy to use and goes with me anywhere on any device.,
"In order to get any reminders. Deleted app immediately. Otherwise, I would have like it.",
Easy to use. Help to keep track of my personal tasks and to-do lists.,
Nowhere near worth the money... Many cheap or free alternatives,
They should focus on more free features. I like to see more updates.,
Wish there was more settings. Grocery list would be good too.,
Just not worth the change. id have to reinvite my collaborators.,
Great app to stay on track and see exactly what you have got to do and what you have done.,
"Great app. Wish it had the ability to set both a start and due date on 
tasks.",
Everything you need and more. Best to-do list App by far.,
I Shouldn't have to link my accounts or emails to make a to do list.,
Many restrictions under free usage,
Third party apps need to be able to be moved to the SD card.,
"Alarm is premium feature, right? Are you sure? Lol, I can't test it because the most basic function is paid and expensive.",
"Keep up going it is very efficient app, and we are waiting for more",
Where would we be with out this lovely app. Keep up the good work. Thanks,
Just what I needed! I love the reminders!! I like that a task doesn't disappear when it's past due. And I can reschedule it. Easy to edit! Simple display. They didn't over do it. I appreciate that.,
"looked okay, but wasn't what I was looking for.",
There are much better alternatives that don't require personal information or a login.,
I use this on a daily basis. Awesome app that is continuing to be updated on a regular basis,
$28 just for labels! Others have same and more features for free!!,
For personal & professional use. Veryyyy user friendly and easy to collaborate with your team and family [mostly with your husband!!;)]. Highly recommend.,
"... Because although it is a good app I want to make a one off payment, not a subscription payment model.",
Nothing bad :D,
Dope app i love the simplicity and also the widget. Keep up the gold work,
Great app for reminders.  Needs to be incorporated into the main menu top pull down viewer.,
Only issue is archiving completed tasks,
Personally I tried it out but I found the functionality limited.,
"Multi platform , usable when offline, simple enough to use.",
Reminder only available with premium? What's the point since there are plenty of free to-do with reminders? Not going to pay just for this. Uninstalled.,
"I used to be a lazy bum,now I am an organized bum",
~30 usd/year just to run reminders & alarms.. thats shameful.. unistalled the app..,
Minimal and perfect. UI could be a little friendlier. Great widget!!,
I belive every must be planned in a systematic way and thats what it gonna  do Wt TD.,
I keep up with my schedule more than ever :-),
Useful only for paid users.,
I am using the free version. Still find it very useful,
This is the app to get things done!,
Find it user friendly + great way to stay on top of your game.,
This app is very helpful with school work! I definitely recomend especially for school!,
"It does what it's supposed to, and does it extremely well.",
"Great App, increased my productivity and let me keep focused on the important tasks",
Works as described across all platforms. Android fone and Chrome app,
Push notifications dont work on Mashmellow!,
Its a $/month app,
"Beautiful and useful UI, lightweight and fast. That's what I was waiting for :)",
Bad experience not easy to,
I hate that it keeps sending me emails,
Pls add a persistent notification option of todos,
reminder is in pro basic things should be free,
I have a premium trial but reminder isn't working.,
This App is vet helpful for me m completing my all tack on time by the help of  this app thank you,
I like adding the tasks using voice command amazing and makes task addind much easier,
I couldn't sing up,
Two words: Google keep.,
Very good and intuitive app,
found a better app with more options for free,
Use any do insted,
Very useful to help us in term to organize our schedule,
Easy to use and portable over several platforms,
Even the most basic functions require an annual subscription. Thanks but no thanks,
Helpful Because i am know very organized know and i never forget what i need to do,
Very Good A Lot Of Cool Features And a genuinely Good app,
Must have for people who want to be something,
my experience is quite happy while using todist Daily bases,
Good but there is some of the main features are available only in premium,
Plans out your whole week And jeeps u  organized,
Make me more productive and can arrange the task and job,
Will be give 5 star if reminder and widget feature added to free version,
"Too complex, can't set task in advance",
Reminders only premium version.  No offline version either.,
Uninstalled.,
lol who spens so much money on a simple to do list app,
A lot of flexibility to scheduling daily tasks and projects,
At a glance information and priority sorting to show you what needs to get done NOW,
Limited features in free version.. Not intuitive,
still needs lot of work,
Wouldn't even let me sign up with an account!,
Great app for team productivity with a committed development team. I highly recommend it.,
Even better after the new update.,
"Too many emails, annoying so uninstalled",
Great but would prefer custom delay when rescheduling.,
Useless without reminders in a free version,
The reminders are constant and everywhere,
Get your lazy ass on track,
Nothing special as a free user.,
I can keep track all my works,
"Clean interface, easy to use and smooth!",
Crap app,
5 minutes in and I feel organized. Exactly what I was looking for.,
Why do I have to login!! No privacy at all,
"Great design.Also, I really love your gift - 30 days premium.",
Reminder alert is a premium feature? No way will pay for an app that doesmt doesn't allow me to even try the basic features for free.,
There are many free apps who does same job as you pay for the premium features of this application,
Asks for a purchase...even to set a reminder,
My life is suddenly organized and I can't believe it.,
"Any do es la mejor, punto.",
"This app, even though I uninstalled within 5 minutes had been CONSTANT SPAM to my email for the last week! Extremely annoying, will never download anything from this dev again.  EDIT: Since I can't reply I'll edit. That WOULD have been ok, and I already have before rating. EXCEPT for the fact that when I went to unsubscribe... Your system tried to sign me up for 2 MORE email lists! It was hidden at the bottom of the page already set to ""yes please, send me more junk that I don't want"". THAT'S BAD BUSINESS!",
"One of the TOP apps, Thanks!",
The design is good but what can you do in free version? There is nothing. Google Keep is way better.,
I don't want to sign up to everything I use.,
Many of the features are not available in free mode whereas same features are available in other similar apps. Don't know why it is editor's choice?,
...and looking much more solid than the beta versions.,
I can not login to my facebook account because there dont have this button. Window have it,
Great app for what it is. A simple to do list.,
$30 year to use app,
Reminders just keep disappearing. Please fix it.,
It is my go-to tool for organizing my life.,
Love the ability to make tasks recurring.,
I can manage my time now,
Clean and simple. Great tablet layout.,
Lack of basic functionality such as notification.,
The connection to Gmail is a real time saver and keeps  my inbox clean and to-dos organized,
Pushes a bunche of email notification without asking.,
Love it. Helps me stay organized across devices.,
Need to pay upgrade for simple reminder feature,
Tried multiple to-do's. Like the set up of to-doist best,
Must create an account to use. Boooo.,
Along with the Gmail extension and connected to Cloudmagic this is awesome!!,
Can't even organize your tasks without having to pay a high price tag,
"Just installed newest version to try it out, but can't add a task b/c it won't let me add a project.",
Everything is on a separate page. Google Keep UI is better.,
"Очень надеюсь, что приложение будет только улучшаться , а так все прекрасно.",

Supereasy to use. Love it !,
Thorough to do app!,

It's Android wear functionality is very limited.,
Excellent. Just what I've been looking for. Well worth the money.,
Helps keep me organized.  And it is easy to use.,
"Very sleek, easy to use. A great app all around.",
"Not the type of ""to do"" for me",
Would i pay $30/year for an app that doesn't do anything more than many of the free apps do?,
It works and it's easy to use.,
Other apps are better.,
I've never seen a to do list app where the Reminder feature is premium/ costs $$.,
"Simple, fast and easy to use.",
At least provide sync to google task for free users its very basic func in other similar apps,
Required registration is a turn off.,
Good user interference,
Does exactly what it says. Very helpful for daily lists,
Has everything needed to plan tasks and keep them organized.,
"Great app, far exceeds the competition.",
Simple intuitive layout makes this super usable.,
Has nearly about every feature one would anticipate.,
"Love it, don't like the idea of a premium though.",
It is a todo list better ones that cost nothing,
"easy to use, reminders are very helpful",
How can we set the perfect time to make a reminder with out upgrading to premium......?,
I love this app!,
Nice app to manage tasks over multiple operating system..,
Requires purchase to do anything!,
Have used other similar apps... This one is the easiest.,
Its easy n simple app.,
Really useful to organise my life.,

100% needs calendar view,
EU NAO VOU PAGAR PRA Q ME LEMBREM DE UMA COISA,
Very good app..but could be so much better.,
Very good to do app... A few missing elements that could make it perfect...,
One of the easiest app to keep you organized. Simplified and handy.,
If you add alarm it will be the best program,
Helps me keep organized,
Gotta love something that helps make life work,
Easy to use and nice design,
Have to pay for something as simple as setting an alarm for note,
Wish it had the ability to work on the gear s2,
Superb app for better productivity,
Use it everyday - absolutely love it :),
I thought this would be a good app all the sudden I got all this time to my email just seems a little coincidental,
No integration with Google Task. Useless.,
Enjoying using this. And looking forward to exploring the integrations.,
Waited for 2 hrs. Still it says to wait,
Keep receiving reminders even after app is uninstalled. Please remove me from database. Thanks.,
VERY GOOD APPS FOR SCHEDULE & TASK .,
Too expensive. Ticktick is better,
They won't even let you set reminders in the free version.,
"Reminders are a basic function of todo and task apps, without that function this app is useless to all the free users",
Simple and powerful. Elegant and works great,
Keeps me going. Keeps me focused.,
Not compatible with Exchange,

"Very useful, syncs beautifully among devices",
Great to do list app. Simple and aesthetically pleasing,
No thank you! Uninstalled,
Seems intuitive. Hard to justify premium price,
Amazing app to manage ur tasks.,
Why I need to pay when I want to add a tag !!!,
Help me organise and maximise time better.,
Best in class features and device support.,
Uninstalling after trying to set a remainder. Paid version only.,
The premium upgrading is expensive,
Finally a good to do app.,
Can't even set a reminder without buying the app.,
Very useful well-planned app,
Wish i didn't have to pay,
Pretty cool app with tons of integration!,
A brilliant people for people who need task scheduling and organisation,
Tried Wunderlist and came back.,
Even basic features are premium only!,
Tried many of the others..... The best...  Great cross platform support...  Intuitive interface,
For the people who find one reminder is never enough!,
Need improvement in capturing phone calls,
Great for organizing homework!,
I love it. Very simple and easy to use.,
Easy to use cross many device,
I find the sharing option very useful,
Easy to use and great Google Home integration,
Best task reminder and keep you motivated,

Great app but needs sync improvements,
Its help me to do something,
It works awesome super simple,
great for time management and getting stuff done,
Easy to use and love web to app integration,
My Omnifocus alternative for android,
This ish saves my life,
Liking it so far,
Good application,
Helps me stay organised,
I will love to learn more about the application,
Too many necessary features are Premium only,
excellent tool to organize your days and life...,
Subscription based software is evil.,
It is a great way to organise tasks.,
Amazingly simple and highly productive.,
There are better apps like this that are free.,
Very easy to use. Everything at one place.,
I want to still see what I did or not.,
Great app. I want to get 20 000 points ;),
Every useful feature is premium subscription about $30/year,
That's is cool,
Without upgrading you i couldn't use it smoothly... Don't waste your time & data by downloading it...,
Great app! Easy to use too.,
"Great app, fully recommended",
Fix it,
It nice app. Thank you.,
why do i need to login to your website to create a list locally on my device? that's pretty lame.,
Why the hell would i pay for alerts when there are many aps that do exactly the same thing for free with alerts....seems a bit silly..installed...uninstalled.,
Does not have a reminder unless u oay for the premium version,
To-do app with notification as paid service...,
i love the view atchived tasks feature.,
So good but so greedy.,
"It's too busy looking and although I've deleted it , it keeps popping up. 
How do I get rid of this app???",
Just stahp,
No remainder in free version,
Major features need premium version,
Does what it says on the tin loool,
No reminders unless u pay,
Didnt try it yet lel,
Can only set reminders in Premium. Can't cancel account within app.,
"other apps do exactly this, but for free",
Complicated. Mess. Wrong UI buttons.,
No integration with GTasks.  Not going to reenter over 250 tasks and notes by hand.  Uninstalled.,
Easier for me to use than the browser version.,
It does what it says! Great app!,
"Reminders, the only reason I downloaded the app, are locked behind a paywall.",
"Keeps you on track, excellent",
A basic thing like reminders is not included in free...... Strange.....,
can't live without it,
Easy to use to do list app,
Wonderful to-do list app.,
Works well.,
A great motivational tasklist with great advanced features.,
Easy to use and practical,
Better days are starting here,
Premium services are well worth the price,
Loved it,
The best one,
Hands down the best productivity app,
A big help to be more productive,
Works great,
This is awesome and cool to use it,
Better if notifications were free,
Quite exquisite application,
Love the multi platform,
Make a task done periodically,
Missing basic features like notification,
Very useful tool for my work,
Good quick task list app,
Best task manager so far,
but are you kidding me $28.99 for a year for premium,
"Best one, I think I will use it for a long time...",
These kind of apps should not need logins. Uninstall!,
Too much behind pay wall. Will continue using Any.Do,
I have no use for this without reminders.,
Ive used this app since last year. Now notes are not available offline. Searching for alternative. Going to leave it.,
Great app for knocking off tasks,
i didn't like the ui and the way the to-do list it manages,
Simply amazing. No more forgetting things,
Cost a monthly fee for the good stuff!!!,
Keeps tabs on tasks I need to do.,
I never give 5 stars,
I hate this app. They changed their widget so it is much less accessible. Sucks. Why not leave it how it was?,
Can do basically nothing without buying it.,
If you want task notifications you have to pay $28.00 a year extra..wow..that's a deal breaker and a rip off,

Whats the use of adding task without a reminder???,
Excellent!! Just superb.,
"So I need a simple to do list widget, yet I have to sign up ? Not",
It wouldn't allow me to login using my Google account.,
Very amazing app :'v,
Poor service,
"... so I even canceled the download half way. I would gladly pay a one time premium, though. No problem. Change that, and we're on board!",
Not free. Have to upgrade to receive features.,
that is so effing annoying why would you email me everyday after i uninstalled the app??,
"I'm doing things again :"")",

All useful features requires costly upgrade,
Hardly any features are for free users. This app should be removed from free category.,
Wouldn't let me sign into my Google account,
No reminder feature. .its a waste...ask to pay then....,
This app is beautifully done.,
Graduated to top performance),
Easy to use and learn to be organized.,
For me this app is perfect.,
You have to pay every year $29 for the feature a that really count.,
Loved it but it wasn't what I needed,
"This app doesn't do what it is supposed to do free, like even reminder is pro feature wth",
Its a wonderful app if u discipline yourself and use it lol I cheated myself many times by putting things back but overall its amazing love it strongly recommend,
Get app been using it for the past 3 yrs,
Thank you,
Another subscription required if you want to upgrade,
Tasks without timer setup,
Useful easy to use.,
"So ₹1,750 to get a notification for an event? Duh! Goodbye!",
Works well. Simple to use,
Poor design.,
Limited  Even reminder is premium feature!,
I like this app.,
I'm sure that is ok,
Not enough features without paying for premium.,
You will get what you need only if you pay. Unninstaling.,
Have to share your business with google NO STARS,
A sucker is born every day,
hope it wont require to upgrade in exchange of money,
All the good stuff require upgrade...,
"Easy, well designed, intuitive. Best to—do app.",
It's fun to use,
Misleading .. Paid App,
Very helpful. Nice interface.,
For reminders you need to upgrade,
Would it be possible to add a feature so that I can directly add tasks from gmails on my phone please?,
Love love love this app!! The Premium is even better!! Highly recommended!!,
Was welcome with requirement to login and a never ending please wait message. Add the option to use offline !,
It's awesome,
Excellent app.,
I need to upgrade to enable reminders. Not Cool,
"Rational, intuitive, and sinks with everything",
$30 annually just for task notes no thanks,
Does not allow reminders unless you go premium...,
Let me know when reminders are free.,
What's the sense if notification alert/reminder isn't free?,
Fantastic performance! Really love,
Very feature rich and helpful!,
Very good easy to use.,
Help me full to organized my day and my plan,
Couldn't see how to create recurring tasks.,
I don't have words to say that this app help me do mange my time so I hop to make applications like this,
Notifications everywhere and clean UI. :),
Love the interface and its ability. Great job.,
Just got premium... will update later,
Best app for getting it done!!,
"Does what I need , I like the simplicity",
The new update turns reminders into a premium feature now? This is bullshit.,
Want to try the app? Get ready for a ton of emails.,
bad app....allgud features for premium users,
Very bad ....it is not opening,
I'm supposed to pay for a basic reminder/notification function? Seriously? No. Uninstalled.,
I can't even get this to download to my phone so I can sync with my pc,
Uninstalled within 2 minutes of use,
To set a reminder you need us to pay? What a foolish deal.,
Could not share the To-Do with colleagues. What's the use of this app?,
It did what I needed it to do...,
"Actually, there should be trial to test premium features before buying",
Google calender is far better...,
Not bad. Can be better.,
So I like it too...,
Next 7 days is good..,
Why do you have to sign in and give up your privacy ?,

Got confused first time,
Data lost in sync process,
Had to upgrade to do thing,
Not much added value,
Use google keep,
Not easy to use at all,
NOT SUITABLE FOR ME,

"UI is too busy, and takes too many taps to do anything",
Great app,
Why would you put in app purchases in a to do app,
It's ok.. Confusing..,
I like this app alot!!!!,
Too complicated.,
Why this app asking to log in? I just need simple organizer.,
There should also be permission to sort out tasks.,
Cool works great!!,
Excellent !!,
"Cool, motivates me! 😁💎",
Great app!,
In other app I do not have to type. Can add task through Google voice,
Only worth it if you're going to pay for premium. No reminders in free version (unlike Any.do).,
For performance.... i LOVE you,
Keeps crashing.,
Напоминания доступны только на платных тарифах. Нахрена это приложение - не ясно. Не скачивайте даже,

Unusable without account,
Subscription premium = uninstalled,
The best,
What's the point then?,
Id use it more if it had a section to enter notes for each task or synced with a note taking app,
Love this app.,

Reminder is a premium feature. Are you kidding me???,

I really needed the reminder option and was expecting the app upgrade to have a fixed one-time cost or app purchase. The idea of having to pay monthly or yearly fees.,
