Review Text,Category
If you think this is gonna have good graphics your wrong but besides that overall I give it 3 stars because there extras mode was where you have to escape a Trex with a golf cart looking thing and you can look back and see the Trex chasing you and there's a fun ride to but roaming sounds exactly what it sounds you get to roam around in a jungle which is fun this a great game but don't get it if you want to save storage,
"The best part a the T-Rex chase. Similar to another driving game but this one is better, crashes don't kill you, just the T-Rex when he catches you. Steering was responsive to head tilt. You didn't need huge movements. The rest wasn't that great. The sound from the helicopter was 3D if you wear a headset, that a pretty well done. It flies around and you can identify where it is by the sound. Take the Dino Ride.",
OK. The app freezes up too often and the quality and graphics can be improved. Sometimes crashes. Other than that its quite a good app. It's cool how you can explore with dinosaurs. Maybe you can add a battle stage where you can fight the dinosaurs that would be fun. Please fix these lags and glitches as soon as you can.,
It looks great and on the introductory screen I had good all round vision but I can't work out how to choose a menu option in vr mode so I have no idea what it is like really. This is probably down to me being a new user but I can't find any instructions .,
When I try to go on the vr experience on the top left of the 4 experiences it does not let me press vr. And there is an ad every minute and all over the screen is just ads Ads ADS. I would have tried playing it until I couldn't use my vr headset. I would recommend if you have the bug too than delete it.,
"The game is decent for being a Free game experience.I dont understand the people who whine about it,if you want something better it would not be free. My 8 year old got a bit bored with it but I play it sometimes for fun.I grew up in late 80s ,when I was a kid we havent had anything like that around.I feel like a kid when I play.Graphics are decent,especially enjoy the dinosaur chase.",
Short fun! The 3D experience is 5 stars worth. But because there's not much replay value it gets 4 stars from me! In an hour you've seen it all. It's like a roller coaster or a Jurassic Park... where you can spend some fun for an hour... But not the entire day! 😁,
"Good but there's a lot of room for improvement. UI is not designed with VR in mind, some of the content feels incomplete. And ad which are quite intrusive for the small experience.",
"Graphics are not right, the 2 images to create the 3D effect do not align perfectly. As an example, instead of seeing one (target) point I see 2 points. Also, games are TOO basic...",
i like the rollercoaster and free roaming. my dreams are more realistic .the dinosaurs be more realistic if you removed the ads. also if the dinosaur in free roam made noise besides eating friendly,
(It's a great game but it won't let me look left or right so I had to give it a three stars but I do have VR set and it's really cool game I just wish that I could look left right to pick different games cuz the past 20 minutes I've been doing the same games!),
"Mediocre game, probably 2-3 stars. I'm giving it 1 star because it ""opens"" itself constantly and crashes in the background without you ever even touching the app. The app is either incredibly fishy or just made really poorly.",
Adds not child appropriate. Adds continually pop up with the adult interactive x rated stories. Have to continually remove the phone from the box provided in the book to hold to close out of them.,
Really fun game. You walk around an area with 2 dinosaurs or you play a game which is escaping from a dinosaur. Graphics look really 3D.,
"This game used to be good, now I want to so it to my grandson and it doesn't work properly. I'd love being able to have the left right head turn work it is a very important feature for this app.",
I gave this is 3 because it gets boring after a while. It has 4 games and one is a rollercoaster I know it says Jurassic VR but it has a very slow roller coaster as a fourth option.,
"Just downloaded, and could only get the game to let me look up and down, no matter where I moved it, it would not turn left or right. Might be fun, looks pretty interactive, but if I can't click play by moving my head to the left or right how am I to know that.",
It's not bad. Just won't let me look left or right. Can only look/move up and down. So can't do anything at least it won't let me select options to get anything started.,
Terrible the sensitivity is really low so you have to turn your head loads just to move a tiny bit and you have to turn your head the opposite way.,
This works excellent I don't have a VR headset anymore I gave it to the kids so I took the app off this was so much fun,
Absolutely terrible!! There's so many ads you can't do anything. Can't even play the game just keeps going back to the main menu! Don't waste your time with this game.,
Too many annoying ads popping up while trying to play with no way to get rid of them without removing phone from the vr device. 👎👎,
You should fix the left and right turnings you can't turn and you have to get out to get to touch the left or right problem during vr setting,
"The game looked cool until you play it, I couldn't move my screen to choose stuff in vr so I couldn't do anything which ruined everything please fix so that I can play on vr",
Love it. The graphics feel nostalgic from when I used to play on a PS3.,
"Its so fun. Loved it, especially the dino escape. I dont have cardboard vr i have somee other vr headset but it still works the same five stars :)",
"Love the app! But why for Cardboard? I use a actual headset without the hands for it! I hate when it says ""Cardboard Virtual Reality"" I just hate it!",
"my vr headset doesn't come with joysticks, and i can't do anything but go to each one and look up and down.",
I HATE IT 😡 you can't move unless you want to tap it BUT after the game it won't let you pick a different one... Soo I HATE IT 😡 but I hope you can improve .... I'd give this 0 stars if I could😡😡😤🤬,
I love it its Nice 3d and when i bump into a tree i actually think that i can reach out and touch The tree The develepor should cuntinue updating The game more and expand it even morr,
Doesn't work amazing to look anywhere but up and down you have to use your finger.,
Great App. Fun to play! Definitely recommend if you want to kill you time with something fascinating!,
Its a fun game but not replayable. P.S Ruan the VR doesn't work because you didn't turn on VR setting.,
I put it I tryed to play it my vr head set but I could only look up or down but not to the left and right.,
I do not like this game because if you look down it takes you home and I just do not like it man I wish you could look down with out leaving the place and it is so stupid to make games like that and I am never playing this game ever again and if you have this game to make things clear do not look down,
"I find it ok , but I can't move left or right so if I have to move left or right to select something then I can't do that. Uninstalling ...",
"absolute rubbish that wont work in vr mode on the Samsung J5 ( mind you, most things dont work on or with Samsungs worse phone ever built in the history of mobile phones... )",
VR mode gave a black screen for a few seconds then crashed.,
The graphics are terrible the only thing I liked about this game it let you choose if you want to do a VR or not and it only letting me go up and down ISO I get to the 2 *,
It is amazing and so realistic but it was a little laggy so it gets a 4.🙂🦖,
Couldn't move left or right so didn't even get a chance to try it out. Uninstalled,
Doesnt work. I have a note 9 and all it did was load for 10 minutes. Garbage.,
The fantasy ride is beautiful and the dino chase is really fun. I played for hours,
v. good . but the game is very bad . it kinds tells us to just move your head side by side,
Not a very good app. Makes you see double vision. Needs improved,
"Too many adds, good luck finding the proper settings for vr.",
I see two different unrelated views. Looks like I'm looking through diving goggles.,
It is so awsome and the texture is so realistic even though i have a cracked phone,
Looks good but cant move right or left so impossible to select options whilst in vr,
"Full of ads. Terrible game, anything for free is always terrible.",
Not bad... but looking for the whole jurassic park kind of experience.,
The game is fun on touch but when you try vr you can't select a mode,
Nice dino simulators and saw a few dinos. Good joyride. Fun. Congrats,
Very boring 😴 no fun u can't look unless u want to touch the screen,
I think this game will keep your attention for a good 35 minutes then it gets borded but has OK replay value,
"Nice game, does get a little boring at times, but fun",
Advertisements; game wants you to give permission to use your user ID for advertisement purposes.,
its a terrible game i got bored 20 seconds in the game dont play terrible its got very little things to look at its very boring,
3d five stars but the game is very very short but if anyone sais five stars that is fine,
adjust everything i know about but it's still double vision.,
"It's childish and I love only the pinky Park lol ..... make it more horrorfull lol 😆 so it can get 1b download , see other games like free fire 🔥 don",
Only really worth it if you're new to VR or if you're extremely high.,
This game is horrible the vr does not move at all i can not select anything when in vr mode,
Very boarding game. And Also soo disturbance to the mind. Please don't download this app,
It's awesome I love when you run away but I HATE it won't download faster,
it is an amazing vr experince it was so real audio and everything,
"only cool thing is the rollar coster, but appreciate the effort",
Is boring it has to meny ad's and it takes a lot of time to load,
Don't download it double screen and doesn't work right,
I love it it is soooooo fun I love this game is so so beautiful that you could go on rollercoasters I'm driving I'm saying I love this game so much,
"To anyone downloading this game, read the user agreement very carefully!! The data that this game mines and shares is ridiculous, and you cant play it unless you agree at the beginning. You might as well give the developer your social security number lol",
I used my VR headset for this and it just didn't give me a 3 D or real feeling.,
It's really cool when you first get it but then it gets weird out and that's why I really don't like it,
I think it is really fun and when I'm on the go I can put my goggles in my backpack and I can play,
It was very realistic and it had a great a graph,
Best Virtual Reality Game ever not that many ads,
Horrible it needed more GB then it said and then didn't even work,
Very touring one to control and not suited for S20,
Too much bad game only 4 options are there and they are also too much bad,
Elaine gaylick gave me all the numbers of caviar when done it once and I deleted it on accident birthday does I finally redownloadded it 5 stars or I could give a 100 I would,
It does not work it is time wasting and and mobiles MB wasting,
limited so gets boring quickly.,
it is terrible cant move left or right only up and down,
It DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE MENU ON VR!!!!!!!,
the coster was nice but I could not turn my head In vr mode,
This game would 't be so BULL if the controls were difficult,
Fun app good for getting use to new vr gear good started app and free,
unable to click on vr menu canmot proceed further,
This is amazing my sister loves it and really enjoys the experience,
I hate this game hitching and laging and shows menu I hate this stupid game and bad controls I'm 15 years old and I thought this the coolest game on phone but no it's worst game on phone does anyone like its no they hate this stupid comment all tell me of you like this game or hate this game it sucks like alot guys never ever again play this stupid game ever again I hate I slot please tell me everyone hates it's I hate it's so it's a bad laying and hitching game who hates this bad game stupid ga,
It was amazing because i have the set for it but i i i dont like it i love it.,
I'll give it a 4 bc this is for kids and not teens or adult!...🤣,
Its a cool app just too slow in free roam,
Ok in vr mode it wont let me look side to side but i can look up and down fix this plz,
This game is awesome my favorite part is the roller coaster,
This is the best its really not but it have a lot of things an i bet its was hard to make,
Awful really low graphics do not download,
wont let you move left or right do not install,
Loved the first experience of vr... really cool to get a new vr started,
i can turn my head right or left nor can i play in vr as i cant turn to choose something,
"This is a ""teen"" game and I'm not a teen and it's not scary at all I don't even think my 2 year old sibling would be scard",
Terrible dosent even deserve a star you cant walk or go anywhere I rather vr rollercoaster,
Doesn't work at all. Asking some stupid permissions at the beginning.,

It's. Ok,
"I would give five if the regular mode worked. I tried swiping tapping trying to look around. Once I click the classic mode it pulls up more options, but when it does that it won't let me select any of those options.",
"Has a nice appeal to it and interesting concept. The graphics are nice. Could improve the rectil function and I like the back button that appears when u look down, good idea.",
"Once the app is started there seems to be no way to completely shutdown the app and unload to reset it to its initial state. The only way I am able to do this is by re booting my phone. Otherwise the app stays in a loaded state, and starts where it was at from previous run.",
"VERY BORING. This game was no fun and had to many ads. I think the graphics 
were ok. Not 5 star rating ttough. If i could i'd give 0 stars. Sorry just 
my opinion.",
"Really good. but one thing, please make the graphics better. but still a good bring game",
"It's is the worst, you can't decide on what you want eg: if you press 
jurassic jungle the free roaming it doesn't work, not for me anyway",
"sorry for my review.i feel sad, i expect this is great but not,better 
delete this app 👎",
Was pretty good but my VR goggles didn't work with it so I had to keep one eye open,
Its really cool but u should put a gun in there and animal's so u can shooot them,
"Two of the game modes don't work,but the two that do work are cool. This is 
a game you could play again after a while",
"This game is sooo good! But one thing, I want to be able to go off the 
roller coaster without having to take off the goggles",
"All things are scaled down: tiny houses, tiny dead man, small helicopter... 
Even the Tyrannosaurus Rex is not so big. The virtual boundaries confining 
my movements do not correspond to physical rocks and walls.",
"I love the game but one thing please, every time you go into vr jungle please change it up. Maybe you can free the t-rex and let it rome a little",
It does not properly take into account the inter-pupillary distance.,
I can't even look around don't get,
Ducked out of the office today but I will be there at the same time I don't have a car so I can get down there and Skylar and Skylar and Skylar and Skylar and Skylar and Skylar and Skylar wat happened to the baby shower,
Wouldn't work. Can only look up and down. Can't even chose an option in vr,
Gets a little bit boring after a while but I like it,
There was nothing  to do if you update please give  more stuff to do,
"Once I got close to the T-rex.... I got scared I was like ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" my parents think I'm watching a horror movie XD",
This game is stupid. This game is awsome for my cute brother.,
Don't get. Terrible. Glitch so much u literally cannot do anything.,
Wish you could look around,
I did. NOT like it I recommended it a no no,
Its great dane and the beast ones do ummmmmm,
I really liked the address theater it is so cool,
Couldn't turn my head,
Works great with my VR :D,
Its awsome it feels so real,
Tilt sucks only view up and down,
You can't turn to start,
"i like the only fantasy roller coaster ride need more fantasy roller 
coaster ride plz.",
not good 😊😢,
The worse game ever,
It's terrible,
It's cazy good,
This app is joke,
This is horrible,

Did not like the game,
Made for kids.,
Virtual reality,
I like it,
Okay,
Loo,
Ahhhhhh,
"I was really disappointed with the app. It showed up all crosseyed and glitches a lot! Itf made my eyes hurt really bad. Amazing the first time, since then it was useful.😠😑😤",
"It's terrible, and crashed my whole phone don't use this app I had to get a new phone because of it",
simple but good.  Love when I see T-Rex.  Need more dinos or otherwise we will get bored.,
If you're look for something that's somewhat thrilling. You're in the wrong place,
"When I opened it, a screen with many pixels appeared and it took a while to load until a screen with a button that said ""start"". Clicked on it and it gave me the option to use the cardboard or use just the ""touch"" option. I clicked the option to use the cardboard and it didn't allow me to turn left or right to select the type of tour I wanted. It just allowed me to look up and down.    Really bad experience",
Man this is the first VR app that actually made these goggles worth the money..needs better gameplay and graphics but they pulled it off its not too bad i was still real impressed,
I think it a cool experience  that is fun and adventure and my sister loves she an animal and dinosaur lover she thank y'all very much I do to thanks,
No gameplay other than being able to look up and down in the initial screen. Avoid.,
There is no shooting or any thing all I see is a tree and a rapper and that's lame I hate it,
The app is great though I wish we can change to speed of how fast we move in free roam. Also can you have it not fixed to one side of the device. I want to to use my built in headphones in my vr headset but the plug is on the left side of the headset and the plugin on my phone would be on right side with this set up,
This is the worst. It makes you so nauseous and there is no room to play,
It's a really good game but it made my head hurt and made noches,
this app is trash all I can do is look up and down DO NOT DOWNLOAD,
Retarded stupid and It  need some milk,
"PLEASE make it usable with the little remote VR BOX😎 Can you make the area bigger so that we can see the other dinosaurs? Plus the simulator bugs on the sound, you need to look exactly at the center",
This is a very stupid game and can't move at all,
Awesome experience wow I really enjoyed I recommend all to play this game I love it,
"A very, very detailed game. Only one question though, how do you work the simulator?",
Ypu can only look up and down . Ok do not download  this game.,
Penoso en todos los sentidos. Una pérdida de tiempo. Sólo publicidad,
This game sucks my sis had it on her phone but when I started the app my phone was not letting me touch the screen so my mom made it up to me and got us a family plan and we got iPhone 8s,
Nothing really good about it,
Can't believe it has 1m users..,
Really good,
It lit,
Amazing,
exited to play,
Booooo,
It will not move side to side it will only go up and down so in this matter I am not able to play the game 😑,
"Would not open.  Splash screen come on asking if i want virtual reality or touch screen.  I hit  VR, it pauses a second then game completely shuts off, goes to home screen on phone.  Does this every time.  Using Samsung Galaxy Note 8.",
Having my child experiencing dinosaurs is great. Then having a horror game pop up is unacceptable.,
Doesn't work just shuts down every time you VR,
Very basic game but an add for Blair Witch when you exit the simple kids game was not ok.  Uninstalled.,
"Popped up ads, unusable controls, please fix",
Crashes when VR selected on the first screen.,
I mean it worked but i could not even move around,
Its free roaming mode is good but more dinosaurs and big area required,
The vs mode needs a remote controller,
Didn't work with Droid. Total bummer! It took forever to download and then I was in the middle of a lake? Nothing happened in any of the areas.,
"Good Game, But Please Remove The Ads",
Game really sucks! TO NEW DOWNLOADS DONT GET IT!!!,
All it does is move that is it hate it,
I can only look up or down. I have a orb vr. Can you help me?,
The game didn't turn on my phone but it did on my sister phone,
"Wourst game of man kind don,t wast time dowlding it",
Crash VR.,
This is the worst game in the world😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,
It's awesome,
Blah i hated it,
Its broken,
I love this game,
Best game ever,
Make it more realistic,
It is nice,
Great experience,
Poo,
Cool,
Cool,
awesome,
Sucks!!,
Before the update my phone support this game...but after the update I cannot control anything using google card board.. itss not working..the gyro and motion sensor is not working!,
Doesn't work because the advertisements broke the app. Waste of time.,
Why dosent this game have 360 nice around,
Awsm graphics but proformance speed is slow,
graphic looks great.,
Don't work gose blank on my phone and don't let you go back to your home screen have to keep taking my battery out not worth downloading this game...,
Rubbish. Will not work on non-compass phones. Simple extra code needed for tilt operation has been ignored. Other apps are far better.,
Cool my daughter will love it,
I can't use it by samsung gear vr 2017. Gear vr is opened oculus and I can't finde vr application that I install from google store. Some one help me.,
"Good for starter VR. My phone is barely compatible with VR, so it was good to try it out on a cardboard setup.",
"I have Google VR Setup as Cardboard v1, but the game doesn't show the proper image (the shape of the images is all wrong compared to other apps that work properly with Cardboard v1)",
IT FROZE MY PHONE IT DID NOT COME OFF :-[,
VR controls do not work.,
"You can't look around, all it is is an ad",
Too many ads and vr glitches out,
Only can go up and down,
Couldn't even start the game.,
Graphics are ok. Easy to use. My kids love it.,
Great way to keep seeing advertisements over and over,
Wouldn't even load just crashed phonr,
"Horrible, doesn't even turn right!!",
Hated it.,
ITS REALLY COOL,
Cool vr,
Cool,
Do NOT get this app,
It sucks,
Peece uv shet,
It not working,
Fab   u    lasss,
As soon as I got in it gave me an ad straight away the controls where hard to use in vr I then swapped to touch and couldn't swap back to vr,
"You can only look up and down, please change this.",
I hated the game,
App opens then it asks google cardboard or phone as soon as i press vr it instantly crashes. Samsung Galaxy S8,
"It was alright, if they would've made it in higher resolution then I would have given it a 5 star rating",
So lame. I can't do anything except look up and down.,
I didnt like the controls but the graffices r cool,
Graffics are blurry but a epic game with my vr,
I did not get to do any thing there was too many ads,
Its good but its error if i download,
Can't get past the main menu even without the VR headset. Update please.,
Great app guys keep up the great apps,
This is a really good app i had a ton of fun with it it was great 👍👍,
You can not see the dinosaurs when you ride them,
Can't start the game in VR mode the camera doesn't move to the free roam or joyride only to the ad....help plz,
Amazing!!!!!!!...... ......how I wish I could really be there🙂.,
It's great!!!,
It's amazing,
It's amazing,
Omg love it,
Its nice,
Horrible,
I like it,
It was hard to control,
VR,
"I really liked being able to ride a dinosaur though I would like it if I could control where the dinosaur went and maybe a bigger area. Otherwise,  GREAT GAME!! 😸",
The dinosaurs look very realistic and the 2 choices both offer interesting things,
Very tks for creating this game i got stuck with my j7 now i made a good vr game,
Dont play it will damages ur eye focus,
"Ads, Ads, Ads.. Even before you could see the program the first time. Good graphics though.",
Really fun! Im very happy that it doesnt require a gyroscope :D,
Its Great app but i wish there should be more dinosaurs and more bigger place,
Rabbit mountin its kind of fun nice game☺,
It was one of the best vr experience ever!,
All your games are awesome.,
For a vr it's pretty good,
Am I supposed to have the headset,
This is SOOO fun!👏👏😂👌,
my 1st vr experiece ..loved it..keep it up👍,
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! ########@@@@@£%&&%%%,
THIS IS BORING,
"ADS, lots of them!",
It bad,
Fantastic i like the graphics,
it is very cool,
Fantastic,
AWESOME,
It's sucks,
What,
Sucked. You literally just walk in a set path of circles. The sound track has two measures of repeating music. No thanks.,
One of the best vr apps. A little odd to control. I would appreciate it if you can stop by looking down or tapping.,
Cool I like it if you don't have a vr set just play normal and still just as cool and awesome,
OK graphics doesn't make up for no control system and is littered with adds,
This is not really the best game but interesting to have a look at. I got bored of this pretty quickly. For some reason my view glitched out when i was in the cinema...,
"Tap to start, app crashes. Google Pixel",
"Keeps shaking, its like I'm a virtual crack head.",
The app keeps jamming before I play,
Hates that it stops working after a while... uninstalled!,
You cant look side ways so if you want a real vr experience dont download this app,
When you get it quickly delete it then never come back to it,
The gyroscop on this  game is pritty bad,
"Didn't turn at all, and only looks up and down",
You need a Bluetooth controller such as the Xbox one s controller or PlayStation 4 pro controller this may be usefully for your use of you want it to work properly,
Can't so anything you can't move,
Nice creating...Hope you have even more games,
So awsome and amazing  Love the game.,
I loved it best game ever played,
it's so cool nasty guys,
Don't add bloody graphics,
Won't connect to Oculus Samsung Gear VR,
I wish we could submit 0 stars,
"Very very very bad,",
Great vr experience.  Lot's of fun.Well done!,
It was thrash I have a headset and it doesn't even turn,
THIS game is so much fun and I think it would be a good time to play when you want to explore 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😙😙😙😙😙😙,
"Lame, sucks a$$",
It sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!YOU CANT GET A CLOSE LOOK,
Why cant i move anywhere? No matter what direction i look in.,
Not good at this stage,
I think it is boring,
It's nice,
You don't get to see the dinosaurs💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥,
Awesome experience,
So cool,
You roam using auto walk. I saw two dinosaurs. There were VR theater ads and buildings with more ads. It's mostly an ad game with dinosaurs.,
Good,
Hate,
i. 💘  dinosaurs,
Improve the quality,
Not up to the mark,
Works with no gyroscope,
Its sucks,
Robzan chen,
Ads,
Nc,
That's was the worst vr experance ever 1. You can only look up and down no where else 2.sry but I don't like the grafics  3.no action  This list going go on for an hour more if you are looking for a good vr game go somewhere else  I hope this was helpful,
"There is no 360 degree view and no free roaming, i could only look up and down and stand in one place",
"Can only look up and down, not side to side or at any other angle. First app I've come across that didn't work right.",
Good experience. IDK why others were having issues. I can move and 360 degrees of view. Animations were playing just fine. I used a HTC M8,
It's a really good game but first impressions aren't really good because of the game logo. So Mable you could change it,
It's kind of dizzy a specially  if you have autism. But it's kind of fun tos.,
Pretty cool but don't know if there's a stopping point of u want it to be more exciting watch it on something squishy I did that and I though it was real,
Normal mode is awful and vr mode is....kinda good I dont have a headset but I yoloed it and it wawnt the best.anyway YOU CANT MOVE so please fix this,
Really cool and u get 2 c up down and to either side . There is something to consider every where u look,
"Not much going on. You can look up and down only. Dino-ride mode is fun for a while to be fair, but the free roam mode doesn't work as you are stuck in one place.",
The whole thing is out of focus no matter what I do,
I understand the necessity of ads but playing them every twenty seconds is to much,
"Ummmm,why is it moving like that,its so weird😕",
Boi I couldn't even look at any thing and it is pointless,
I was excited but then  I can't move it sucks,
Good but not great you can't move,
That was fun and relaxing! I loved the Dino ride,
Do you like random ads? You'll love this experience then!,
Left and right eye seem to be switched. Using Utopia 360 and Galaxy S7.,
It sucks nothing moves at all and i can't even do anything or move,
The worst VR,
I think the gameis cool,
Dosent work in any mode,
It's amazing,
It was terrible,
Best game for vr,
Awsome,
Hated,
Hated it,
Great,
Need improvement,
Meh,
Osum,
"I enjoyed how there were two types of modes, and the choice between Normal or VR controlls. but it is repeative and the theme will eventally get annoying.. You are also just in a small area in the game, so I say it's 3/5, it's okay.",
"Soo Immersive,  like Jurassic Park but Real. Derp. Is this the best they can come up with at launch. 1996 graphics, minimum features, the UI is based on a normal touch screen phone not head tracking; very little effort went into this app.",
All of you who say it's bad cos u can't look around just don't have a phone with 360 gyroscope,
"Its too laggy. Not that amusing but its fine, my son liked it",
"The menus are not controlable with the VR headset and there is no gameplay, and there's only two dinosaurs to look at.",
I was not able to move at all. On games like this one I get excited to move around. However I like my surroundings in the game 🎮,
I kept getting pop ups on my phone saying Jurassic VR has stopped running. I've already shut it down twice. Still keeps running game. Uninstall ing...eating my battery.,
I liked it but if you could add more dinosaurs and movement in free roam it would be better it is  good. And you put lots of hard work and time into it so I think it's really good,
It's really cool but it's needs to be updated to walk around more and walk fast but other wise it has great features good job on the art work and looks of the dinosaurs,
"People if u can only look up or down,u don't have gyroscope on ur phone so dont blame the app!",
I wish they never had this gams. Number 1 you only stay behind a rock. Number 2 in normal way you still hide behind a rock. You should not get this game ever trust me.,
All you do is watch the Dino walk and eat also horrible animation,
You can't even walk around look side to side. Do not get this app.,
Can't look at yout sides and free roam isn't good I like Dino joy ride,
It is so awesome and fun i lobe the graphics GREAT JOB whoever made this😍👌🔥,
Honestly it's not fun realy you can't go anywhere,
This app Shut down my phone before we could even use it,
It glichtes to many times and it doesn't even work,
You can't even move and you can't do anything but look up and down,
You can't even move only when you ride on a dumb dinosaur for not get this game. It is AWFUL,
You can only look up and down. All this is is a video that repeats,
I did it in vr mode and it shakes so much if you fix the problem I will rate 5 stars,
All I could see was one direction I could not turn around!,
All you can do is walk around it's boring.,
Just looks up and down. Doesn't move or look sideways.,
"I suggest you make a new update in which you can controll the dinosaur in ""dino joyride""",
This does not even let you move  around its so stupid,
It won't turn left or right it won't move too,
Only look up and down,
Can't even get to the game before crashing.,
Tje other coments say can look around except up down u can just get a better device and im using this app on the shittyist device out there a samsung tabket alpha test9.12,
ONLY UP AND DOWN. CAN'T SEE BEHIND.,
I liked it but you could've added fast walking and free roam had no dinosaurs,
"I really like the dinosaurs but there's only a trex and a...velociraptor? I wish there was a few different ones. Other than that, it was great!",
You know it is when it has normal or VR version,
Itz great but if improve the graphics it will be great,
My daughter loves it she just got a VR headset for Christmas,
Why is it only up and down and where is the Jurassic in it it's only a bong fire with dinosaurs on a movie set,
Game pad support and control would be nice,
"You app sucks, I can only look up and down.",
"Not much to say. Lots of options, its a good plus!",
Good game you can ride the dino,
Sitting down and viewing this is ass. Wants access to everything on your phone for no reason. Just don't. Don't get it.,
Thanks humans people,
Best things thing ever,
"Can only look up and down, not side to side",
Just a loop. You can only look up and down on some devices. Yo,
Worst Dino game I've played in my entire LIFE u suck :-/ :-( :@ 😡👻🐺:@,
Elly I could only look up and down!   ヽ(｀Д´)ﾉ,
THIS Game when we'll in my VR and it's the only game that works in it so ya,
This game is very good but the dino can only move.I would recommed it. And I love this app...................,
Only moves up and down...,
Its great so much fun!!!😁,
I know you hate it guys but the owner who created this app has taken a lot of time to make this so do you rather have nothing to play by vr or u have something to keep you intertaned,
If you hate this app your a hater,
Wolf Monster indominus Rex,
There are only two species and.... what's the point?,
"So cool, people need to try this 5 stars for this app 😋😋😋😋😋",
I 💖 it!!!!!! Its so 😎ool,
Why do u need to access photos and WHY do u need to have access to our PHONE CALLS!??!??!?!?!?!,
Boring...,
Best game ever,
Your person  doesent move,
Awesome,
Loved ir,
Cool,
Scary,
Cold,
I was rideing the raptor,
Cool,
Garbage,
Boring,
Cool,
العبة زبالة,
🤑🤑🤑🤓🤓🙃🤗,
Not working,
Are these free,
😃😃😃😃,
Ok,
"Could've been amazing but after a minute you realize you've done everything this app has to offer.with 2 dinos and the joy ride being basically a circle,u get the experience from the screen shots.no need to take up space downloading",
Its a great game but it would be better if you could make it turn 360,
The only problem was that I can't move without the dinosaur.,
So cool I am 8 now and I used to love dinosaur's and I still love them,
Very good graphics and the best VR app,
Just one raptor and a lot of adds.,
Love this game,
Good,
I am going to have the 7 the same time gtydtte5 I was just the right to the next few days. the only thing that I have a great day. I am a beautiful person. I am a beautiful person. I am a beautiful person. I am a fghhf,
The best experience ever the only thing which is not good is the sound quality please fix,
Not worth keeping but a good gander,
The images don't line up for a good experience,
Why it cannot in vr boc,
So far its good!,
"Tried tilting, tapping screen, and a remote. Nothing worked. Uninstalling.",
It wasn't the best,
Kids love it so do i,
Wack,
radddd,
Really nice app. Great graphics and love to see more dino in near future.,
I do not have Google cardboard but I have something else it works,
"I handed one of those Google VR boxes, needed to find something that a 4 year old would enjoy and stumbled across this.. He loves it.",
cool but make that you can go further please do that and I will be very happy😀,
Great job keeping the app up-to-date! Even with Daydream coming out soon! I would just would update the app's logo with the new Google Cardboard logo.,
This is what you called in Filipino is walang kwenta!!!,
Ive used gear vr and this game has graphics that keep up with gear vr apps,
Great graphics,
Pretty good,
one dinosaur ru.s in circles one only eats air.,
"Old style graphics, action is slow, boring!",
Awesome app its amazing love use in my gr8 for it so fun,
Scale seems very off. Why am I the same size as a house?,
Why do i feel like a midget haha trex looks cool but yer scale is off im to low to the ground,
really good!!!!,
Not up to the mark.,
"This game is okay... I suppose. The visuals looked rather nice, but there's nothing to do. You move unbearably slow, and the most exciting part of the game was entering the mini theater in in the game that advertised better games, than this one. At lease I am having lots of fun with those games now, I'm just disappointed I couldn't say the same for this one.",
All it does with head tracking is lag and pop/stutter on kazam tornado 348 octa-core 1gb ram,
Works but no experience whatsoever. You slowly stroll through a static world the size of a large backyard.,
Every time I try to start it an ad pops up and it resets the app.,
I found some of it.. But great idea and designs are fine. Good for 1st timer vr users good job,
"Doesn't work for me, as my phone (OnePlus x) has to be upside-down in the headset to avoid it catching the power button. Other apps work both ways, this doesn't.",
"Standing around, no interaction",
Walking is too slow to be real and graphics are age old...nothing much to look around,
very nice small demo but the scale of models makes it seem like well...models of things rather than the real things....the big dino trex looks nice,
It's upside down the whole time it's horrible and who wants VR ads,
you walk sooo slow and its so boring,
there's nothing to explore in jungle all i can see is 1 small dinosaur running and other big one is eating also drifting too much,
U are just walking but the dinosaurs are awsome,
PLEASE MAKE THE GAMES RUN PERFECTLY WITHOUT GYROSCAPE!,
It was ok for me and some was good in it some was not good,
You can go any where,
"Just improve the graphics and make the area large... Add more diffrent types of dinosaurs, birds,etc. There are like only 2 dinosaurs...",
dont download!!! i wastes your internet and always stop responding,
Demos the immersiveness of vr,
"This game like thay sayed: walking with dinosaurs..... Just only walk, but we only search about vr and download!! Don't read what is game about",
Can't figure out what to do in this game other than walking around.,
because of the graphics,
"Not working on my Sony Z2, even after I upgraded it to Android 5..1.1. Any idea why?",
Doesn't work,
To basic,
Only 2 dinasors??!,
"Not worth it! While using it, it randomly pops up ads that you can't get rid of without taking it out of vr headset. It would be better if they offered it as a purchase app.",
Really liked the graphics and the experience but give us a way to stop walking. I got extremely dizzy trying to look at things because of the always walking.,
I like it but where can I get that really sweet theater room best I've seen so far,
"Ironically, the best part of the app is the ad movie theater. Would be cool if you make a dedicated app for it to play downloaded videos!",
The only demo where I feel like I'm there. Wish you could stop tho.,
"You move so slow... It is unbearable. The graphics are really cool, and it would be an amazing vr experience if the pace wasn't so dang slow arggg",
Movement doesn't follow looking direction well or at all. Using note 5,
It actually works good on my Blu Pure XL. Other vr apps doesn't work!,
"Needs a way to stop to look at the view! Other then that, it feels like the real thing! Dont play to long or you will feel queezy",
"The game itself is really bad, but try to enter one of the village huts! The ads are really worth it",
I got this for my 4 year old to tool around with for a few minutes (and no longer!) at a time since he's obsessed with dinosaurs. Even he knows that Brontosaurus was a poorly assembled fossil with the wrong head and discovered to not be real and renamed to Apatosaurus almost 3 decades ago. 3 stars until you get with the paleontological times. I don't want my son looking forward to a lie.,
"Gyweg gn wgwretwfwtwtwye tree twtereetetete eery et eery eh, but this one of my life and death 2nd place to start the game is a very long time",
Grad hdhjggm,
I can't not open this app on my galaxy s3 android 4.1.2,
"Actually a great little vr app, and my daughter absolutely loves it",
Looking around is smooth and the camera follows without any noticeable lag too.,
The most vr game I love it really,
Use to Work Earlier,
Doesn't even load. Force closes straight away,
اللعبة روعة روعة روعة بس ماعرفت كيف العبها,
This game is not running in my phone,
More of an exploratory game,
Works perfectly on galaxy s5,
"I thought this game is like the movie BUT it's just Freaking walking everywhere...see,I cannot understand on what to do...pls help I will rate 5 stars if I help me",
Will not load on my Droid Maxx. Uninstalled,
You just look around and walk... is that really it?,
... nice for my kids,
Brilliant graffics amazing experience,
crashes on start up,
Unfortunately stoped,
Good vr experience,
Great,
ok,
Doesn't show up in Google Cardboard app's library like all of the other VR apps.,
"Its really cool, but i dont have a way to get the cardboard instructions.",
Totally for Jurassic park fans.,
Awesome.... Wonderful VR Experience Game.........,
Not a working in vr mode,
With the new update using the game with Google cardboard doesn't work. Messes with my eyes.,
Everyone in my family is loving it until the new update came in. Double image and my gyro sensor was messed up using other vr apps. I noticed that sine this is yhe only app where gyro sensors are stable and the rest of my vr apps jitters. Uninstalling.,
Unusable ... Too many ads,
Blurry,
"One of the best visuals for the cardboard that I have seen so far. But how can you call this a game if you have no real interactions with anything, you don't throw nothing or anything. And maybe make it so the magnet switch adjusts to two different speeds. Bit great visuals. I don't get that double vision or virtigo type of feeling",
"Hey it's great. But it has so much more potential. I was bored after a little because of how slow I was going. Make it faster but not to fast at a comfortable speed. Maybe make it so the dinosaurs will interact with you? That would be cool, or provide different mini games like. Ride a dinosaur. Run from a dinosaur. Kill a dinosaur. Stuff like that. I will say that the dinosaurs are very pretty. Once you wait 5 minutes to get up close to them",
"(1) Increase walking speed, (2) add/alter things and (3) create an objective, e.g. you have to find things to escape. Otherwise it's a nice start and is a promising start and it would be nice to see it develop into a game, which it clearly has the capability of!",
"I say this because you need to look side to side,walk a little faster and could be able to interact with the dinosaurs please fix and I'll give a five star rating thank you",
"Wow better graphics, and there is a small variety of dinosaurs and a small space, very bad review on my part and I am a YouTuber so to see a game this bad speaks alot. Sorry but horrible game.",
"You don't have controls , slow , no good reason for download",
Not much to it. Tiny world to roam around in. A couple of dinosaurs milling around and a helicopter flying over head. Same rhythmic drum loop playing constantly. It gets old very quickly.,
"Too bad, I get double vision with my 6"" phone. Most other VR apps work just fine. I guess they need to update something.",
Video drifts sideways. Made it almost impossible to walk in a straight line.,
"Please help. But still Dino's look great. Apart from the missing Dino's , please make the map bigger and add more Dino's. Also, why is T Rex  stuck in a small cage and not moving around?",
It's just that when I look to the left I'm expecting  it to walk to the left but there's a problem with it,
"This is amazing. After getting the View Master for Christmas, I found out that my phone wasn't compatible with its app so I searched for other apps and this was amazing!! My little cousin loves it too!!!",
I just can walk straight and hit the rock,
"Didn't run, just a just crawl... and keeps getting stuck in rocks",
I really like this game also when the dinosaurs walk.,
I can't even play this app without running into rocks what the heck }:(,
THERE ARE ONLY TWO DINOSOURS,
Walking With!,
Sux,
Ilove it best onfeedback,
Good,
Hey everybody make you have a view master/ Oculus rift sort of device or you can just get a piece of cardboard and carve out a phone space and put your phone in there and hold it up to your face. Oh and Lunagames needs to work on this Alot,
"As it is it just looks like a bunch of assets dumped into a small area. You also walk very slowly. Put in a narrative. Start the player in the helicopter, add in some interaction such as finding out who the dead warrior is and who shot him full of arrows. Let us ride the dinosaurs.",
Has no motions. Walk straight into a wall and you have no way of turning or moving so your stuck. This isn't the only game like this too. Pretty much every vr game that says you can move your phone to control game camera doesn't work.,
Because the dinosaurs don't attack and why do you show up in a big theater,
Does not get any position data from sensors so movement is inposible. Phone is jiayu g2f td on android 4.2.2,
Its a bit odd having to steer by sight and not stop but the one thing that bugs me most is there is just two dinosaurs and its not interactive in anyways. But it IS what it says it is,
"The developer programmed it so that your eyes are effectively 12 or more inches apart, which makes the ground look like it's just inches from your head.  Bad programming...",
I loved it. But I wish I could control the random movement. Also my view angle was being changed randomly when I want to look at an object. But overall it was good. Still it can be improved. Keep up the good work.,
"Very cool, but the sense of scale seems off.  It feels like the camera is 1 or 2 feet off the ground, and everything is miniature.",
"This gives the great experience in 3d but it would be great if there are  more then one dinosaur and cages, caves etc overall great job...",
"Not as good as I thought it would be, too small of an area also. Walking around was jerky.",
I can load it onto my Samsung Note 4. But cant see it when it is hooked up to the Samsung VR headset.,
The game walks into a straight line and then you stuck in the wall with no way to turn back.,
Speed of walking very slow. Very few dinosors. Totally useless. Uninstalling,
This is the VR app I start my friends on. Easy to control and everyone likes dinosaurs. I have only seen the T-Rex and raptor along with a helicopter even though the description mentions more. Add more dinosaur for 5 stars.,
"If theres minus rate i will rate -3 stars, because it has no fungtion",
"Every time I try to start the app, and ad immediately pops up and it resets to the loading screen this repeats over and over forever. Samusung Glalaxy S4 mini",
I haven't got to play this yet because me kids are enjoying it too much.,
"Of the available dino apps in play store, the most visually stunning dinosaurs and scenic park... Waiting for more dinosaurs...",
"Needs some more dinosaurs, and screen touch should toggle walk so you can chill in one spot and look around. The new cardboard kits use a screen press button, so would be a great addition.",
Its simple and forgiving when setting up your phone in G Cardboard. Clear good graphics and 360 head tracking is smooth and accurately responsive. If you have not tried vr yet believe the hype. When you find apps like this one its a fun amazing experience it would be nice to have more room to wander around or different environments and btw if you can't turn around you don't have a gyroscope in your phone,
"Great VR 3d graphics, very promising, advanced controls would be helpful. Expanding the world would nice.",
How do you even move make controls learn to make a game not a picture,
It good because u can see lost of house and dinos😌😌,
5 stars to counter all the idiots who can't read.,
"The dinosaurs look great, it would be cool if there were more of them though. Like a stegosaurus or a brachiosaurus to give it more variety. It doesn't lag but for some reason it doesn't allow me to turn, I can look up and down but not left and right, although, I think this is just my phone  and not the app itself since it works on my friend's phone. A good app over all, just doesn't seem to work on some phones",
The best vr till now yet it needed to improved,
Nice app but one can not move side ways or even look side ways...,
Told VR thing is kind of foreign to me. All I could manage was to wander around and occasionally a raptor was run by. My score is meh.,
"After 3 minutes, you'll want to uninstall.",
graphics is good but there are just two dinosaur . Please add more then it would be more interesting.,
"Somewhat cool, but only two dinos and the walking pace is pretty slow.",
U feel awesome. Very good work from developers team.keep on improvements.,
"A very nice introduction to Google Cardboard.  A fun first app, and the price is certainly right!    Thanks guys.",
It was good. But am stuck by a wall,
"Nice adventure , it's still needs some work but overall is nice",
Absolutely amazing vr app to experience and enjoy the virtual reality technology.,
Cannot wait for new update and also shooter game vr experience :),
No way to control.. Stuck in stones,
Didn't work on my Nexus 4,
Its acting weird after last update,
Almost killed my phone,
I'll give it 5 when they fix it so you can turn left and right,
Doesn't support Goole Cardboard v2. So can't focus correctly.,
Please ....,
All I kept thinking while playing this game was VR remake of Tomb Raider One.,
Stuck on loading screen on s6 egde plus.,
Game freezes after 2 secs.,
Direction motion not working on my LG Realm...,
Better if can pick stuff or add any game in the vr,
"Just walk straight, i cannot turn righ or left.. any solution?? I will kindly change it to 5 stars",
Um walk in a straight line watch a helicopter glitch out what is the point lol only seen two dinosuars,
It's good but the movement is slow,
But I would like more dinosaurs,
Nothing special. I thouth it would be something cool,
Need more area and ability to interact.,
All I see is constant advertisements for other games.,
After installation Eset antivirus has warned me that game has a threat AdDisplay.AppFlood.A      Why do you add this in your game?,
You should make more of this stuff.,
What are you even suposed to do,
It needs more dinasauros,
I feel like I am standing with dinosaur,
Not suitable for cardboard. Ugly.,
Graphics amazing really 3D really VR,
Doesn't let me turn,
Wanted to give no star.,
Work 100% on galaxy s6,
Can't play it,
"On your dinosaur your, right?",
cardboard VR....faadu app,
At loading,
Good to show to kids!,
Need more place to room......,
Hate it how do you work it mine did nothing there is no way to control it !!!!!!!!!!,
Every time i stuck at Stone.How to go forward?,
For a second,
Best game ever,
Can every android phone connect to vr glasses?,
My cell phone don't have gyroscope.. So can I use Bluetooth joysticks? Please I need help :( .,
Awsome,
Nice graphic,
Super.........,
great,
why does the app sais No Gyro on my Galaxy Grand Prime ? it has gyro ive test it many times but the app cant use it any suggestions ?!,
Boring,
Great,
Doesn't load,
It,
,
"First off the graphics and the dinosaurs are great. But with a few tweaks it could be amazing. It's a shame that your able to move through the dinosaurs like their not there. As your moving forward constantly your not able to stop and have a proper look. Maybe controller options would be good. The play area is not very big and when you walked round it once, that's about it. Would be nice to have more to do or explore. Great start tho. I've just heard this is a demo so well worth a download. 4 stars it is.",
Definately gives you the right atmosphere. Would be good if there were more dinosaurs and bigger space to walk around. Not too bad.,
"The immersion is not there. The raptor running in circles, helicopter flying in circles, and annoying short looped music is really annoying and ruins it.",
Great vr floating experience. Very nice 3D depth when you get close to objects. I used a cardboard vr and my galaxys3,
Very nice. Truly felt like I was walking among the dinosaurs. Ran very smoothly.,
This is an excellent way to demonstrate the power of VR. It's also very relaxing in an exciting dinosaur kinda way :),
"Among the ones I have seen, this one takes the cup. The only thing is the sky is not properly done, killing the other art. But all in all impressive it feels immersersive.",
"I guess I expected more. The graphics and all are good but there is only two dinosaurs, making it not that impressive.",
Better graphics or turok weapons needed but really cool concept maybe make some jump scares,
Very immersive VR effect. Needed more action. Liked it though.,
"Definitely one of the best vr apps, I hope to see more of this.",
"Pros: graphics. Cons: movement speed is too slow, can't stop, character is way too tall.",
If you walk under the t rex its just like its in your living room fantastic,
Needs the option of having barrel distortion,
Can you add keyboard or gamepad input for phone that didn't have gyroscope?,
Beste vr app in de store!,
Would be cool with controller support.,
Wooo! So awesome! Love this stuff.,
But how do I control it?...,
Great,
Awwwwwwwwwwssssoooooooommmmmeeeeeee!!!!!,
Good,
Not interactive,
It is a fun app for vr but please take your time updating the correct measurements and real world sizes and the most important eye level. I couldn't watch it for more than 5 min and i felt like puking. Also make a control for the magnet to increase decrease and stop walk speed.,
DONT FALL FOR THE PHOTOS You can tell the developper didnt give a damn about this app. you can clearly see its all 2D done to look like fake ugly 3D with no control except head movement you cant even tell your dino since it appear like a phantom beside you. everything is scaled like sh**t .,
My 7 year old boy absolutely loves it.   He thought it was really realistic and it was fun seeing him enjoy the app so much even though it's only a demo.  The only issue I could see is that this app is not showing up when I start the Google cardboard app.  it's not showing up in the list of the apps that I've installed.  I actually have to look in the app drawer to find it.  Thank you.,
Bbhhbtfjzycidub ubu university ji k jvk k I'm gonna go out y I am so sorry for a bit more than I,
Come on peeps we got the powerful Smartphones why not the powerful VR Apps to match them. Something that is responsive to the phone & just does something other than nothing... Am sorry if this Review is not very good but it matches this App that is simply not very good lol,
"My favourite bit was watching the helicopter spin helplessly around in the sky because it's helicopter kept getting stuck and it looked like it was going in to a tail spin every 5 seconds.  Sorry, interesting effort, but yeah, you get what you pay for here...",
What is this its a piece of crap you know why cause you can only look up or down and it moves by itself stupid.Its like a repeative video.,
"so theres just two dinosaurs; one runs in a circle, the other stands still. gets old fast",
I had a black screen on the edge of my phone and I put it in my VR and it didn't work I don't recommend it please reply owner of game,
I can't even play the game it just comes up with an add and I can't even get rud of that. I also can only look up and down not left to right which is really frustrating.,
Can't move around I have downloaded 13 apps in only 2 has worked a little on my Samsung devices grand prime and Core prime seems google has most of these apps to operate on nexus iPhone well the most expensive phones,
Can't install this or most vr apps.  Followed all the trouble shooting actions with no result.  If  down loads but says there's a fault installing.,
"You can walk around and there so many details like leafs falling dinosaurs houses trees, etc.",
"so i go in thinking ill be able to manually walk around and maybe even do stuff, but no, it makes me walk and when i press the button it quits",
"The 3D effect is great,  but it would be nice if we could take more control. I'd like to at least be able to stop moving so I have the time to appreciate what I'm looking at.",
"Got one of those viewers at TJ Maxx for $7 and works perfectly. My 3 year old grandson was enthralled, but it causes phone to heat up.",
"Needs work, graphics are OK and there's no turtles I like turtles",
It's a nice way to do something when your bord but the graphics are not that good so I gave it four stars.,
Doesn't respond well enough to head movements. Also needs controller support otherwise good.,
"It's ok I guess but after a while it gets boring and it's was the same thing every single time I viewed same dinosaurs , same environment and same thing",
I can't even play but from the other comments you must of done a good job so ... I jest hope it is as good as it sounds,
After updating new version. app becomes really bad. Bad very bad graphics experience,
I couldn't get the screen to line up on my phone. For some reason it didn't sit in the centre and instead it was to the right the rest of the game seemed fine but the vr was made pointless,
"Kept changing views, and if you do anything but look it went back to phone mode.",
I'm sorry but this is so boring I just can't do it it was horrible. It's just a video on repeat and the music is very bad and annoying so I'm very sorry to say that I hated it.,
Rubbish all u can do is look up and down u move you're body and u won't GI anywhere,
There are exactly two dinosaurs and a glitching helicopter. You go like 2 miles per hour.,
I LOVED IT!  The only problem with it was you couldn't move very fast.,
"We can't even move left or right , very small world",
It's a very bad app not working at all I've download it in other phones still not working,
It sucks you only stay in one place and it lets you walk up and down you can't move,
"You cannot look back and I can't move to the left or right. In free roaming is still the same, I can't even move except look up or down. Othrr than that the dinosaurs are cool.",
You can't even turn around and in normal mode the screen just goes crazy waste of time,
"There really isn't much to do, but it's a fun app for about 10 minutes of exploration.",
I like the way to look around but it just goes any where u want u can't move,
It's not a good game i can only look around and I can't do anything but look around,
"Very poor, very glitchy. Had the game installed for 15 minutes, didn't get to use it properly once",
REALLY MAN also if you can't look right and left it means your phone doesn't have/got a gyroscope there that's the answer to your problems (game is so cool),
"Very good. It's realistic ,but you need a veryyyyyyyyyyyy good like lenovo z2 , Redmi note 4 ,mi max , Samsung c7 pro ,C9 pro",
Its good but when your not playing it slows your other apps down and says unfortunately jurassic has stopped when your not even playing it. It was so annoying I deleted it!,
Make Dinosaurs attack the user or something when get closed....,
"Only because it wouldn't let me walk. Otherwise, I loved the crystal clear graphics and it worked perfectly on the goggles I got for my 11 b-day",
It keeps shutting of when my nefew is watching and when I'm on others apps it says the it has stopped,
Cool. You can't move left and right but side to side works for me. I have a vr headset and it's cool. DOWNLOAD it,
I um not to be mean but this is the best game ever and some reason there's noadds on mine there's only one add,
#I like this game with i have also purchase the vr box online but the game is filled with adds other than i have no nonliked thinking about this game# £●●|] game (good game👍),
This game is adventures I love this game it's good and more adventurous 10 more other things than anything,
Needs Help,
"Its a little boring wondering around the same place over and over, but over all its fine.",
App wanted to control phone calls. Denied then crashes on startup,
Well u font do much with it kinda boring I wouldn't reccomend,
One has to experience it.  Problems with GUI makes irritating every time.,
I'm not sure if it is only for cardboard glasses someone tell me,
"Look,I havnt tried it because it won't work in downloading I bet it will be cool when it works but seriously...PLZ FIX",
Going to test this baby out I don't have vr machine but I do have 2 magnifying glass,
You don't have 4 million downloads. This is one fake app,
My daughter has a vr she said it was good quality but it was boring and I thought so too.,
Can't move legs or run any where but good for 1st time experience,
"Movement is slow, head tracking was off and the overall immersion was lacking in comparison to other apps..",
The game was really slow and nothing happened you just moved around,
I HATE IT IT WONT EVEN LET ME CHOOSE A MODE AT THE START THIS SUCKS!!!,
all you do is see Dino's and ride on them if you like it I don't care,
You can't control where you move but a straight line! Notify me when it's fixed and I will install it again,
The time is mixed up there is a dead person from the ancient times and there is a glitchy helicopter,
U need more dinos and let's be able to stop moving and more places,
I hate me and my self and I solo ride until I did because I'm alone for life,
I walked up to the t-rex and I walked right through needs some work done,
It says my phone is not able to use this app,
does it only let u go up and down and not left or right,
"Rexy isn't big,you walk so slow and you can walk around a tiny world .",
I have not played this game yet and by the images I already think it is going to be amazing.😜😙😄😍,
Boring. Same 2 dinosaurs in 1 small environment and lots of ads for other games,
Rubbish realy dissoponted also to much ad when you try to ply the game,
Sucks You cant even control the Veliciraptor Fix This,
"Rabbit Mountain!It's not just this app but all your vr apps!You need to add 
the ability to look side to side!I would love to use your apps but you 
really really really really really need to add that ability.",
The graphics were pretty good but the rest was boring... do not download!,
I cant move left or right...it keeps moving forward thats it,
My many just got me a pro 've and I can do so much with it,
If you do talk to me!,
There isn't anything to do. I got bored after 10 second.,
Downloading it now will give three stars to start off for graphics... But depending on the app I will give five stars,
You can only look up and down and it shows the same thing over and over again,
When I first tried it I actualy fell over in amazemant,
Dont get it all you are doing is riding and staring at dinosaurs,
Why it was downloaded by so many! It have got nothing! OMG! People even write good things about this s**tty game.,
It is like a dream. It's like I am in past.    One say this is good,
Its good if u just brought vr for the first time like me and its quite fun but u cant move!,
You do nothing besides look around and see glitchy dinosaurs and it makes my eyes hurt,
All you do is walk around on a diniosor thats not even going 2mph,
The information in have any questions about the new York City and District news and sport headlines,
You can not stop moving forward unless you get stuck. And moving forward is REALLY SLOW! Darn this app for making me waste my time installing it.,
"I just got a virtual machine and downloaded some apps and I chose this, but when I go into virtual mode, it does nothing but look up and down!! So unfair and stupid!!",
I think that it should have missed you so much today,
It was kinda crappy at some points but it all worked out,
People are dumb looking left and right steers the dinosaur duuuuhh,
"Hardly works, graphics out of a early 2000s game..",
You do anything but look up and down,
PLEASE!..UPDATE THIS GAME AND IMPROVE MORE STUFFS LIKE WALK FASTER IN FREE ROAM  AND MORE...EXPAND THE MAP AND ALLLLLL....THIS GAME HAS POTENTIAL SO IM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. Coming soon updates..also make the game more realistic,
"It sucks! I tried to play, I was standing in the middle of a lake! Plus, it kicked me out and my phone restarted! DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!",
haven't played yet but I think it will be good,
My daughters got it and I'm not sure but they say it's awesome. Don't mind any other reviews this app os awesome!,
WORST VR EVER BECAUSE QHEN YOU WANT TO LOOK SOMEWHERE U GO OPPISITE WAY,
"It's only okay. Nothing here that grabs the attention except the fact that it's 3D & quite saturated, colour-wise.",
Scary probably not recommended then again I probably shouldn't even post for these guys I don't know if Trevor was a Jurassic Park ice person argument of where to put it some people said Madagascar I guess other people said Sri Lanka other than that I wouldn't want to go terribly dangerous against a movie or a television show commercials are my salvation have a good one take care Love the one You're with be with your family always care for one another I'm starting to cry so have fun,
Its so hard to control I got stuck on a cliff,
I played the game on my phone and idk if it was my phone but it wont let me see side ways,
Best graphics and great controls and no gyro determines best vr experiance.Its jurresic world,
This app sucks don't bother,
I do not like it because I can only move up and down 👎 👎 👎 👎,
Not realistic and not fun!!,
It becomes boring pretty fast,
I hate it so much pls dix dis for 5 star,
This game is a stupid waste of time! You have no control over this game at all. I am definitely uninstalling this piece of catraption. 😝😝😝😝😝😝,
Worst app dlt from playstore -_- waste of mb,
"Hate it Hate it Hate it! Do not get this game! Glitches a lot! OMG! Super 
boring! 0 star!",
Don't download this its a wasted of your space/GB👈💀,
I love it I play it every day and I never ever blame anything on this super fun game so I give it a 5 stars!!!!,
"Well for starters if i could give it 0 stars i would, heres why #1 the bio tells lies (you've not had 4 Million downloads only 1 Million and if u are telling the truth i bet the other 3 million people deleted the game) #2 all the words are blurry i sat there for 5 mins to see if it would come up then i cleaned the leances on my Vr thing to see if that was the problem but i still couldent read anything #3 i in the end i just clicked something and all u did was walk around really slowley doing nothing .",
Its so bad cuz its kore slowly..please make normal walk not Just Slow walk!,
Didn't work,
Resolution is too poor... Dnt even worth a single star.. Waste of time,
Its not the best but its really good and ok,
I hate it just hate it like stub y our toe hate it,
It has no stuff to explore litterally,
The visuals are cool but not really excited about looking around the moving picture,
Don't get this app it makes you want to puke I hate this app,
"Music very monotonous, and gets boring very quickly, lots of adverts",
You only go straight  don't   get  it!,
I dont know how do you walk in this game,
Wow binoy gwapo po siya,
One small area to walk around in and do nothing,
ur not able to walk around,
It went into the game and kicked me out,
You just look at a t rex,
In ny redmi 2 it works fine.... In some phones there is no GYROSCOPE and hence they dont support the movement....,
My stupid vr box controller couldn't not work,
Only 2 dinosaurs in a tiny area. Not very interesting,
You can't do anything with this app. I don't recommend this app.,
I didn't even palynological Thai yet ._.,
Great one thing control is a little hard but great with VR,
If you have any further information please do you have a few weeks ago but have not received,
Reallycool and scary when the dinosours pop out of no where,
It's ok but not the best,
Terrible. Would not let me move around,
"I like the t-rex mini game, but this app as a whole is boring as hell.  Why do most VR games suck?",
it just goes straight in line and then gets stuck up,
It is scary but I luved it still #omg,
It doesn't move right at all,
U should make the character faster n add more dinosaurs or its gonna be really boring n no one is gonna download it,
It can't touch any  option in vr mode I hated it,
It's the best around and no one's going to ever take it down unless you do,
"Vey limited,  no interaction",
Its was good but wouldn't let me walk with them,
It was OK but I want a little more action in this plz.,
Well I understand y'all but one thing IT SUCKS,
"Some people think it won't work but not.Some don't have a gyroscope in 
there phone...... Some people say its stupid but not.be kind hearthed don't 
judge me and I love it Rabbit Mountain pls add more features Thank 
you!!!!😊😆😇",
"Cool my friend was playing it , i was controlling and i be like back forward back forward until she got dizzy",
Rte there is no way to control I used googles and regular way and it still didn't work,
It's really great game but it's kinda boring,
I am in love with this game and been having it for 3 straight years.,
I like this game but sometime it stops walking.,
It's got me dizzy at the first spin but it's really good game.,
Ok for a vr game because all of the vr game are bad,
It was amazing I will always love this one it is my favorite 😄😄,
VR part does nothing.,
I got a vr today for my birthday and im getting lots of apps,
Really feels like your in the jurassic times!😯,
Bad game came with a cross-eyed eye really bad game,
عالی هست اما. ای کاش بازی های دیگه ای هم داشت😒😒,
why does it want permission to make phone calls,
Moves slow and has no point,
This game I never see beauteful,
I live it so much and scary little,
I like it but make more things,
i was installing this app then it canceld on its own plz install faster this time,
Why would u rate it 1 star if you said you love it,
Cool but a simple changes needed in controlls to make it realistic,
Cool works well without cardboard i wish i can have in oculus rift,
This game is like a survival game great job for making the game and the art is like a bit real,
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen in my life!!!,
Its a GREAT VR game but it took ages to download,
It was just borung to me but ohwr wise it was great,
Nice game but should try to gain more updates,
Is very entertaining good way to keep kids busy,
This game used to be good bow it's bad.,
It is like walking pass by dinosaurs very good game,
I could not go past the beginning and this is my new phone it ruined it,
Its so realistic thank you for making it,
Loved it the idea of walking aruod and being small is cool loveed gets 5 stars,
"This is really fun very realistic and it gives you a choice of where ypu 
want to go",
You can't move or anything,
So much fun to do if you are bored,
what the heck Google why yah no vr thing but these thin,
You guys should  make  a call of duty vr that will be the best,
Its so very cool,
Please keep making wonderful vr games like this one,
This is cool you can move like wha Im impress,
Its was amazing riding dinos and in a camp i rate it 6 out of 10,
They are reAlly bad graphics😀,
Worst game ever can't move,
I haven't even downloaded it yet,
Its reallyyyyy fun and realistic so m7ch funnnn and when the dinosaurs are getting to close oooooohhhhh my goddd,
Too bad it doesn't support gamepad,
I was 13 while playing I just realize I can't move around but cool too...suck this game,
Installed too much unwanted apps,
It wasnt what i expected,
Graphics are terrible and so is profomance,
It dosent do anything boring,
Bad vr experience,
Cooler than anything else in the world,
Does not work right,
DONT CARE About my Control rate..... i only give 3stars to rate the control... because i dont know how to control vr😂,
This is just a park not much to look at needs improving once you have seen the park which takes about 2mins theres nowt eles to do,
i like the game but the control's are crappy.,
U can move ur head around but u cant walk around in free roam,
"Couldn't download, takes forever and gives an error code",
Needs work,
It's OK but my phone is stupid,
I got my daughter a vR head set she loved looking at all of the stuff and she is a 11,
Yo i like this game you guess got play fifa 16 so fun,
All you do is stay in the circle at the start and you never see any dinosaurs. How do you go into the jungle? Do not install!!! Very Disappointing!!,
Just s black screen,
I like that it feels like your at Jurassic world in real life,
When I turn around it  doesn't work,
0! Cause it wont download to my phone 😢,
There was a story about a girl from Syria,
I haven't played it but I do like ice cream,
Its very low graphics.. So poor,
It is very very very very trashy it is the  worst app every,
Goes so so  and there is nothing to do,
Its cool and i love dinosaurs This game is good if you want to see dinos,
XCGIRLX,
I really didn't like this app because it wouldn't let me choose my gameplay!,
Looks good but not that good.,
But.... other worlds are mucccchhh better,
i was looking forward for trying vr for the first time but nope you need dumbass Googlecardboard which sucks serious dick,
Good should fixed anything s bog,
IT'S AWSOME  BUT IT TAKES TO LONG TO DOWNLOAD.,
"It downloaded but when I opened it, it wouldn't load.",
It did not even let me on the game !!😧,
I liked it. And so does my brother and sister,
Am great full for such a wonderful 💓 virtual reality game,
Worst vr app. Do not download.,
I like it because I like jurrasic park and jurrasic world,
Took me directly to the advertising add,
good enough actully its bad,
This is the best vr game I have,
Its really good and believable,
I have vr glasses,
Awesome but I don't know how to move or walk,
I've loved it it's really nice though,
It is soo cool you even get to ride a dinosour.,
l it's a good idea to have a good time with the vr 😎.,
"Nothing to do, boring, waste of time",
There is too much adds every time I put the goggles on there is a add,
But I didnt finish the download 😁,
I love it so much my fave is the dino ride it puts u on a dino and moves u around my friends tryed out my goggles on it and 1 said the dino eats a little baby and stuff and the helocopter shoots at u idk if thats true but i like it,
I have vr glasses it will work!!,
Its great bcz im gayyy jk,
It goood and I hope God let it work,
I love this game its so fun to play,
I think you should make it more interactive,
But can u uppgrade,
Well with my vr I couldn't look around accept for up and down.,
cool and looks like real life!,
Really good it's so fun try it now,
this is a really cool game good graphics and everything,
It's so...ugh....I don't tell but slight problem...😛😂,
It linked me to youtubw and not any movies worked becuase it said this account was deleted and the video,
Its really fun but nasty,
Couldn't get off the main menu,
This has so many adds Wen a add pops up you have to take your phone out and hit X it is so annoying,
I could only look up and down,
Doesn't work as intended,
How can you just walk in a straight line... Should have a set path... Even if its a looping path it would still be great than running into a wall...,
Couldn't move around in VR setting,
I like it OK OK thank u for ur time,
Awsome Awsome great fantastic ammazing wonderful cool nice,
For the 1st time user its good,
There should be so much more to vr!,
Good game but more real sounds,
But this is animated,
I love the dinosaurs and the sharks and all of them,
Good but graphics must be high in quality,
I can't move its so dumb,
One of my favorite vr games ever!! Good job developer!!,
You can only look up and down. Doesn't let you move or walk at all,
Fun but not enough.,
It doesn't look around so the settings don't work... It needs fixing,
eSET Anti Virus won't allow this to be installed. Warns of AdDisplay.AppFlood.A (variant). I don't trust this app one bit!,
My phone is a six inch I wish it could adjust smaller,
"Its good ,but bores really fast",
I love it,
"So aggressive , awesome I just like it",
It good but not very good quality,
It is good but sometimes it is lame,
jelajahi dunia alam dinosaurs,

"Full of ads. Terrible game, anything for free is always terrible.",
Not bad... but looking for the whole jurassic park kind of experience.,
The game is fun on touch but when you try vr you can't select a mode,
Nice dino simulators and saw a few dinos. Good joyride. Fun. Congrats,
Very boring 😴 no fun u can't look unless u want to touch the screen,
I think this game will keep your attention for a good 35 minutes then it gets borded but has OK replay value,
"Nice game, does get a little boring at times, but fun",
Advertisements; game wants you to give permission to use your user ID for advertisement purposes.,
its a terrible game i got bored 20 seconds in the game dont play terrible its got very little things to look at its very boring,
3d five stars but the game is very very short but if anyone sais five stars that is fine,
adjust everything i know about but it's still double vision.,
"It's childish and I love only the pinky Park lol ..... make it more horrorfull lol 😆 so it can get 1b download , see other games like free fire 🔥 don",
Only really worth it if you're new to VR or if you're extremely high.,
This game is horrible the vr does not move at all i can not select anything when in vr mode,
Very boarding game. And Also soo disturbance to the mind. Please don't download this app,
It's awesome I love when you run away but I HATE it won't download faster,
it is an amazing vr experince it was so real audio and everything,
"only cool thing is the rollar coster, but appreciate the effort",
Is boring it has to meny ad's and it takes a lot of time to load,
Don't download it double screen and doesn't work right,
I love it it is soooooo fun I love this game is so so beautiful that you could go on rollercoasters I'm driving I'm saying I love this game so much,
"To anyone downloading this game, read the user agreement very carefully!! The data that this game mines and shares is ridiculous, and you cant play it unless you agree at the beginning. You might as well give the developer your social security number lol",
I used my VR headset for this and it just didn't give me a 3 D or real feeling.,
It's really cool when you first get it but then it gets weird out and that's why I really don't like it,
I think it is really fun and when I'm on the go I can put my goggles in my backpack and I can play,
It was very realistic and it had a great a graph,
Best Virtual Reality Game ever not that many ads,
Horrible it needed more GB then it said and then didn't even work,
Very touring one to control and not suited for S20,
Too much bad game only 4 options are there and they are also too much bad,
Elaine gaylick gave me all the numbers of caviar when done it once and I deleted it on accident birthday does I finally redownloadded it 5 stars or I could give a 100 I would,
It does not work it is time wasting and and mobiles MB wasting,
limited so gets boring quickly.,
it is terrible cant move left or right only up and down,
It DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE MENU ON VR!!!!!!!,
the coster was nice but I could not turn my head In vr mode,
This game would 't be so BULL if the controls were difficult,
Fun app good for getting use to new vr gear good started app and free,
unable to click on vr menu canmot proceed further,
This is amazing my sister loves it and really enjoys the experience,
I hate this game hitching and laging and shows menu I hate this stupid game and bad controls I'm 15 years old and I thought this the coolest game on phone but no it's worst game on phone does anyone like its no they hate this stupid comment all tell me of you like this game or hate this game it sucks like alot guys never ever again play this stupid game ever again I hate I slot please tell me everyone hates it's I hate it's so it's a bad laying and hitching game who hates this bad game stupid ga,
It was amazing because i have the set for it but i i i dont like it i love it.,
I'll give it a 4 bc this is for kids and not teens or adult!...🤣,
Its a cool app just too slow in free roam,
Ok in vr mode it wont let me look side to side but i can look up and down fix this plz,
This game is awesome my favorite part is the roller coaster,
This is the best its really not but it have a lot of things an i bet its was hard to make,
Awful really low graphics do not download,
wont let you move left or right do not install,
Loved the first experience of vr... really cool to get a new vr started,
i can turn my head right or left nor can i play in vr as i cant turn to choose something,
"This is a ""teen"" game and I'm not a teen and it's not scary at all I don't even think my 2 year old sibling would be scard",
Terrible dosent even deserve a star you cant walk or go anywhere I rather vr rollercoaster,
Doesn't work at all. Asking some stupid permissions at the beginning.,
I already experience this with my classmate Gelo . There is 2 dinosaurs the one is Velociraptor and another one is T Rexl,
Graphic is not good no fun,
Wow nice looks realistic i give 5,
"I liked it,my most favorate part was the rolar coaster",
I cant move it looks good but how am i suposst to play if i cant move.🐊,
Calibration doesn't work it doesn't Kno where to look,
I like it fun but it needs to be updated,
i love this game alot i play it every day after school i love this game☺,
can't get past the main screen,
It is the best .made my own vr out of cardboard😂😂 the greatest .love it,
it did not really work,
Terrible dont waste an hour downloading,
Has screen orentation problems,
my nephew is crazy about dinosaurs and this reallg changes his mood thank you play store,
I don't have patience for it to load how annoying,
Thank you! I use Cardboard os yeahhh But thank u anyway,
can't even start the game it's clickbait:(,
It takes forever to load,
it was really short and like some people said it wasn't even a vr app,
It was terrifying. I had to delete it.,
Could be better ghraphics but it good if theres nothing to do so ill give 3 star,
Love it...😘😘but can you add SURVIVAL IN JUNGLE with DINOSAURS...😁😂,
Wow this is amazing I wish it still igsist,
Couldnt move my head left and right,
it's lit and u don't have to walk u have to look only,
It wont install i deleted photos and gsmes nothing works 🤬😡,
Not too bad. Kids thought it was awesome.,
The Qulitys Bad But The Dinos are good 4/5,
good but it would be better if I had vr glasses,
Even with out the goggles IT IS AWESOME,
Good App especially free roaming,
I did not like this at all when I went vr mode I couldn't do anything so I deleted his game😤😤😑😠😡👎👎👎😾😒,
Its laggy and will not go the way i want i HATE IT,
I gave it zero stars because IT TAKES FOREVER to load at 100 %,
It is 3D and it looks like you're backin time,
Its just wonderful i enjoy it so much,
Went slow and didn't simulate anything,
This was very boring and had no point to it.😒,
its amazingggggg got to try it 😊😊😊😊😊 happy results,
didnt work couldnt click anything,
Thanks again for all the best games,
nothing great about the dinosaurs.,
you can only look up and down 9 dont play this game,
Can't use VR mode. This game suck,
it was amazing for my little brother who loves dinos,
Great for kids that like dinosaurs,
I haven't even played it but i know its going to be so fun,
it's terrible!!!! it's not even a VR app,
A trash bin of ads.,
This game I so good on all of my phones it's on them,
This game is so bad cuz if you play your easy hurt,
It is a good game at least better then other vr apps,
it would not select the options,
Its real real real I will give the game 10 from 10,
Great to hear from you thanks for the heads up on the email below and I will look forward to your response soon,
Cause it don't move when I do it on the V.R. vision,
this is a great game its best one i can find yet,
VR mode didn't work,
It is horrible you cant even play the game,
I can't get past the main screen.,
This a trex chase after you you in the car it scary,
Its good but cant move if choose is vr,
I don't like this game it doesn't have a fun experience,
can't look left and right in vr,
Most scariest dino park in the world i like this virtual reality and you guys should put mor thimgs like this,
There is no proper instructions on how to use it,
You can only look up and down. I hate this game.,

So fun,
"Full of ads. Terrible game, anything for free is always terrible.",
Not bad... but looking for the whole jurassic park kind of experience.,
The game is fun on touch but when you try vr you can't select a mode,
Nice dino simulators and saw a few dinos. Good joyride. Fun. Congrats,
Very boring 😴 no fun u can't look unless u want to touch the screen,
I think this game will keep your attention for a good 35 minutes then it gets borded but has OK replay value,
"Nice game, does get a little boring at times, but fun",
Advertisements; game wants you to give permission to use your user ID for advertisement purposes.,
its a terrible game i got bored 20 seconds in the game dont play terrible its got very little things to look at its very boring,
3d five stars but the game is very very short but if anyone sais five stars that is fine,
adjust everything i know about but it's still double vision.,
"It's childish and I love only the pinky Park lol ..... make it more horrorfull lol 😆 so it can get 1b download , see other games like free fire 🔥 don",
Only really worth it if you're new to VR or if you're extremely high.,
This game is horrible the vr does not move at all i can not select anything when in vr mode,
Very boarding game. And Also soo disturbance to the mind. Please don't download this app,
It's awesome I love when you run away but I HATE it won't download faster,
it is an amazing vr experince it was so real audio and everything,
"only cool thing is the rollar coster, but appreciate the effort",
Is boring it has to meny ad's and it takes a lot of time to load,
Don't download it double screen and doesn't work right,
I love it it is soooooo fun I love this game is so so beautiful that you could go on rollercoasters I'm driving I'm saying I love this game so much,
"To anyone downloading this game, read the user agreement very carefully!! The data that this game mines and shares is ridiculous, and you cant play it unless you agree at the beginning. You might as well give the developer your social security number lol",
I used my VR headset for this and it just didn't give me a 3 D or real feeling.,
It's really cool when you first get it but then it gets weird out and that's why I really don't like it,
I think it is really fun and when I'm on the go I can put my goggles in my backpack and I can play,
It was very realistic and it had a great a graph,
Best Virtual Reality Game ever not that many ads,
Horrible it needed more GB then it said and then didn't even work,
Very touring one to control and not suited for S20,
Too much bad game only 4 options are there and they are also too much bad,
Elaine gaylick gave me all the numbers of caviar when done it once and I deleted it on accident birthday does I finally redownloadded it 5 stars or I could give a 100 I would,
It does not work it is time wasting and and mobiles MB wasting,
limited so gets boring quickly.,
it is terrible cant move left or right only up and down,
It DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE MENU ON VR!!!!!!!,
the coster was nice but I could not turn my head In vr mode,
This game would 't be so BULL if the controls were difficult,
Fun app good for getting use to new vr gear good started app and free,
unable to click on vr menu canmot proceed further,
This is amazing my sister loves it and really enjoys the experience,
I hate this game hitching and laging and shows menu I hate this stupid game and bad controls I'm 15 years old and I thought this the coolest game on phone but no it's worst game on phone does anyone like its no they hate this stupid comment all tell me of you like this game or hate this game it sucks like alot guys never ever again play this stupid game ever again I hate I slot please tell me everyone hates it's I hate it's so it's a bad laying and hitching game who hates this bad game stupid ga,
It was amazing because i have the set for it but i i i dont like it i love it.,
I'll give it a 4 bc this is for kids and not teens or adult!...🤣,
Its a cool app just too slow in free roam,
Ok in vr mode it wont let me look side to side but i can look up and down fix this plz,
This game is awesome my favorite part is the roller coaster,
This is the best its really not but it have a lot of things an i bet its was hard to make,
Awful really low graphics do not download,
wont let you move left or right do not install,
Loved the first experience of vr... really cool to get a new vr started,
i can turn my head right or left nor can i play in vr as i cant turn to choose something,
"This is a ""teen"" game and I'm not a teen and it's not scary at all I don't even think my 2 year old sibling would be scard",
Terrible dosent even deserve a star you cant walk or go anywhere I rather vr rollercoaster,
Doesn't work at all. Asking some stupid permissions at the beginning.,
I already experience this with my classmate Gelo . There is 2 dinosaurs the one is Velociraptor and another one is T Rexl,
Graphic is not good no fun,
Wow nice looks realistic i give 5,
"I liked it,my most favorate part was the rolar coaster",

Calibration doesn't work it doesn't Kno where to look,

Its laggy and will not go the way i want i HATE IT,
I gave it zero stars because IT TAKES FOREVER to load at 100 %,
